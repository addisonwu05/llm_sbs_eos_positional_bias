Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of
the case:
After Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.
When Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to
bed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy
was declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and
it suggested natural causes of death.
After one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,
Jane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben
could not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and
injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and
haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.
As a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs
were carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the
lung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by
smothering them.
Another possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of
infants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with
SIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in
4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls.
