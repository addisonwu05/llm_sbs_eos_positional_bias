To address the question of how likely the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

First, let's consider what it means for Jane to be "not guilty." In this context, it implies that she did not smother her children. If Jane did not smother Ben, then the alternative explanation for his death could be SIDS or another natural cause.

The presence of injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy (upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy findings) and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben suggests that both infants suffered significant trauma. The absence of petechiae, which are sometimes associated with smothering or asphyxiation, in Ben is noteworthy.

Petechiae are not universally present in cases of smothering or asphyxiation. Their presence is often considered a potential indicator of such causes, but their absence does not rule out smothering. The pathology of smothering can be quite variable and may not always include petechiae.

If Jane is not guilty, implying that Ben's death was not due to smothering by her, then we need to consider the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in the context of SIDS or another natural cause of death. SIDS, by definition, involves no clear cause of death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. Petechiae are not typically associated with SIDS; they are more commonly linked to asphyxia or smothering.

Given that Ben's death is being considered under the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothered by her), and if we were to hypothesize his death could be related to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically involve such findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is attributed to a cause other than smothering (like SIDS), the absence of petechiae is quite consistent with this scenario.

The likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben, given that Jane is not guilty, is relatively high because SIDS or other natural causes of death would not typically present with petechiae.

**80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must first understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of smothering her two sons, Andy and Ben. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be consistent with smothering or other forms of infant abuse, but it did not show typical signs associated with smothering, such as petechiae.

2. **Medical aspects**: Smothering is a form of asphyxia caused by mechanical obstruction of the external airways. Petechiae are often considered a sign of asphyxia or strangulation because they are caused by the increased pressure in the small veins due to the lack of oxygen. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

3. **Analyzing the absence of petechiae**: The question implies that if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother Ben), then Ben's death could be attributed to another cause, such as SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not directly associated with the presence or absence of petechiae.

4. **Likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it means Ben did not die from smothering. The absence of petechiae in this context becomes less relevant as it is more related to the mechanism of death (smothering or not). SIDS or other natural causes do not typically present with petechiae as a characteristic feature. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be expected.

5. **Probability judgment**: The key here is understanding that the absence of petechiae is not unusual in cases where death is not due to smothering or similar asphyxial mechanisms. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be likely.

Given the scenario and the medical context, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is quite plausible because SIDS or other natural causes of death would not typically be associated with such signs.

**80**
To evaluate the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and implications of the given information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. Given this, the alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy is a significant observation. Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxia or smothering, although their presence is not exclusive to these causes and their absence does not definitively rule out asphyxia or smothering.

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, we would expect the autopsy findings to be consistent with SIDS or the actual cause of death. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of certain injuries (like those found on Ben and retrospectively on Andy) might suggest that the death was not due to SIDS but to another cause.

However, the question specifically asks about the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty (implying Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane). If Ben's death was not due to smothering, we would not necessarily expect to see petechiae or other signs of smothering. 

The absence of petechiae is consistent with a death not caused by smothering. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a cause other than smothering (like SIDS or another natural cause), the absence of petechiae would be expected or considered likely because it aligns with the absence of evidence for smothering.

Thus, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, given that Jane is not guilty, is relatively high because it is consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by Jane. The injuries found on Andy, which include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

The question then becomes how likely it is that these injuries were caused by resuscitation attempts or some other non-criminal cause, given that Jane is not guilty.

Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes result in injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones. The injuries found on Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, could potentially be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the injuries found could still be explained by the resuscitation efforts made to save Andy. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts or other non-suspicious causes is relatively high.

Probability judgment: 70
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions, and the injuries found on Ben could be attributed to other causes or explanations.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not present at that time, or they were present but not noticeable or not considered significant by the medical staff.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's injuries were not self-inflicted or caused by someone else in the hospital, the most plausible explanation for the injuries not being noted initially is that they either developed after Ben was brought to the hospital or were not readily apparent.

However, certain injuries such as those found on Ben (including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are typically indicative of significant trauma or force. It is unlikely that such significant injuries would not be immediately apparent or would develop post-mortem in the short timeframe between being brought to the hospital and the autopsy.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is relatively unlikely that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, unless they were very subtle or not easily detectable at the time.

However, given the nature of Ben's injuries, it is more plausible that they were present but perhaps not immediately noted or considered significant by the initial medical examination.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. 

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS rather than smothering or other forms of abuse by Jane. 

In this context, the spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death makes it plausible. Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, this explanation is consistent with Ben's death being due to natural causes or SIDS, followed by medical intervention.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is relatively high because these findings can be explained by natural causes or the circumstances surrounding Ben's death and subsequent medical handling.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The injuries in question were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her but could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These were not initially considered suspicious and were attributed to the resuscitation efforts. 

If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries could still be explained by the attempts to resuscitate him. The key point here is that the injuries were initially thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if Andy's death was sudden and unexpected, such as in the case of SIDS.

Given that resuscitation attempts can cause such injuries, and if we are considering a scenario where Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death could be due to a cause like SIDS), the likelihood of these injuries being present would depend on whether the resuscitation efforts were vigorous or typical.

The frequency and intensity of resuscitation attempts can vary, and it's known that such attempts, especially on infants, can result in various injuries due to the fragility of their tissues.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was sudden and led to vigorous resuscitation attempts (as one might expect in a case where a baby is found unresponsive), the presence of injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be reasonably expected due to the resuscitation efforts.

Thus, the likelihood of these injuries being found in Andy, given that Jane is not guilty, is quite plausible because they can be attributed to the resuscitation attempts.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by her. The injuries found on Ben, which include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are significant and indicative of some form of trauma or asphyxia.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not present at that time or they were not apparent. 

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it is less likely that such significant injuries would be present. However, it's crucial to consider that some of these injuries, like hypoxic damage to the brain, could be a result of the events leading to his death (e.g., a prolonged period of not being able to breathe properly) rather than a direct result of trauma inflicted before being brought to the hospital.

However, certain injuries like those to the ribs and spinal cord are more likely to be the result of significant trauma. If these injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, it would imply that something happened during his care in the hospital, which is highly unlikely given the controlled environment and supervision.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the presence of these significant injuries is unexpected. The likelihood that these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is low because it implies that the hospital staff or environment caused these severe injuries, which is highly improbable.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as this would suggest that the injuries were inflicted in the hospital, which is not a plausible scenario.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by her. The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding could be explained by the fact that it is a common finding in natural deaths. Similarly, the dislocated ribs could be attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, both of which are plausible explanations that do not imply foul play by Jane.

In this scenario, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is increased because these conditions can be explained by natural causes or the circumstances surrounding his death and subsequent medical interventions.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is quite plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or the consequences of resuscitation attempts.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by her. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is being considered.

Petechiae are often associated with asphyxial deaths, including smothering, as they can be indicative of the increased venous pressure and hypoxia that occur during such events. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering, as their occurrence can vary widely.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, as might be the case if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS deaths typically do not present with the same pattern of injuries as asphyxial deaths.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, the absence of injuries such as petechiae is consistent with this scenario.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the implications of Jane's innocence and the context of the case.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of non-accidental trauma, such as smothering or physical abuse. The fact that Jane is not guilty implies that the deaths were not due to her actions, potentially aligning with the alternative explanation of SIDS.

2. **Considering SIDS and the Injuries**: SIDS is an unexplained death, and it is not typically associated with the specific injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). These findings suggest that Ben's death may not have been due to SIDS alone if we are to believe the medical evidence presented.

3. **Evaluating the Statement**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the injuries and deaths of the children needs an alternative explanation. The injuries found on Ben are not typical of SIDS and suggest some form of trauma or intervention.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: The statement that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital hinges on the timing and nature of these injuries. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not a result of her actions, there are a few possible scenarios:
   - The injuries occurred post-mortem or after Ben was brought to the hospital. 
   - There was a misinterpretation of the autopsy findings or an error in attributing the timing of the injuries.

However, the injuries described (such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) suggest that they were likely related to the events leading to Ben's death rather than occurring post-mortem or after hospital admission.

5. **Probability Judgment**: If Jane is not guilty, and if we were to assume the injuries were not caused by her, we must consider alternative explanations for the injuries. However, the injuries described are indicative of significant trauma or smothering, which is not typically associated with SIDS or accidental death. The scenario that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital but were found during autopsy could imply they occurred post-mortem or were missed by hospital staff.

Given the medical evidence and assuming Jane's innocence, it is still challenging to explain the presence of such significant injuries without attributing them to some form of trauma or non-accidental injury. If the injuries were not caused by Jane and were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it raises questions about their origin.

However, nurses and medical staff are trained professionals, and it is less likely that such significant injuries would be completely missed upon examination, although it's not impossible, especially if the injuries were not external or were not looked for.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

First, let's analyze the given information:
1. Ben was found unwell by Jane, and an ambulance was called.
2. Upon arrival at the hospital, attempts to resuscitate Ben were unsuccessful.
3. An autopsy later revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The injuries described are significant and indicative of severe trauma. The fact that they were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is noteworthy. 

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). An alternative explanation given is SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). However, the injuries found on Ben (and later retrospectively on Andy) are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries as described for Ben contradicts a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we're exploring a scenario where the injuries might not be attributed to her. However, the nature of Ben's injuries (rib and spinal cord injuries, etc.) suggests a traumatic event rather than a typical SIDS scenario.

The critical question is whether these injuries could have occurred between the time Ben was brought to the hospital and the autopsy. 

1. **Timing and Nature of Injuries**: The injuries described are severe. It's plausible that significant traumatic injuries would be noticeable during medical examination or handling by hospital staff, even if not specifically noted by nurses. 

2. **Medical Handling and Resuscitation Attempts**: During resuscitation efforts, some injuries could potentially occur (e.g., rib fractures from CPR). However, the range of injuries described (including spinal cord injuries and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) might not all be explained by standard resuscitation practices.

3. **Post-Mortem Handling**: Some post-mortem changes or handling during autopsy preparation could potentially be misinterpreted as ante-mortem injuries. However, a competent forensic examination should differentiate between ante-mortem and post-mortem injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, there are a few possibilities:
- The injuries were not present at the time of hospital admission but occurred afterward (during or after resuscitation attempts), which seems unlikely given their nature.
- The injuries were present but not noticed by the hospital staff, which raises questions about the quality of care or the visibility of the injuries.

Considering the information and focusing on the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty:

The scenario that Jane is not guilty implies looking for alternative explanations for the injuries. If we consider that the hospital staff might have missed the injuries or that they occurred during or after hospitalization, we're still left with a complex scenario that doesn't directly relate to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding the cause of the injuries.

However, the question directly asks for the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty.

Given the details and focusing on the task:

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and available information.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. The question posits that Jane is not guilty, implying we are to consider alternative explanations for the deaths and the injuries.

2. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital. This suggests that either the injuries were not visible or were not present at the time of hospital admission.

3. **Possible Explanations**:
   - **Injuries Not Present or Visible**: If the injuries were not present or were not visible during the initial examination at the hospital, it could be due to several factors. Some injuries, especially those that are internal or not immediately visible, might not be detectable without a thorough autopsy.
   - **Post-Mortem Handling or Autopsy Procedure**: Some injuries or findings might occur or become apparent post-mortem, either due to the autopsy process itself or handling of the body.

4. **Assessing Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, we are operating under the assumption that the deaths and injuries might be due to other causes, such as SIDS or an accident. However, the presence of specific injuries like those described (rib injuries, spinal cord damage) suggests a traumatic event rather than SIDS, which is typically characterized by a lack of explanation after thorough investigation.

5. **Conditional Probability**: The question is asking for the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence. If Jane is innocent, and assuming the deaths were due to an unfortunate accident or another non-criminal cause, the injuries should ideally be explained by such a cause.

6. **Assessing the Possibility**: The injuries found on Ben are severe and suggest significant trauma. If these injuries occurred post-mortem or were not immediately visible, it's plausible they weren't noted by nurses. However, injuries like rib fractures and hemorrhages in the eyes are typically associated with significant force or trauma that would likely be evident or have a clear medical explanation.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are to believe the injuries could have an alternative explanation, the likelihood that the injuries were not present or visible when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of alternative explanations for these injuries. Given that the injuries suggest significant trauma and are not typical of SIDS or common post-mortem changes, one might initially think it's less likely they were not present. However, the fact that they were not noted doesn't necessarily mean they were not present; it could also mean they were not immediately visible or documented.

To address this question, we must consider the given information and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy of Ben revealed injuries such as to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Further investigation into Andy's death, initially thought to be due to natural causes, also revealed signs of potential trauma (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) upon re-examination of autopsy photographs.

2. **The Question at Hand**: We're asked to assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty.

3. **Assessing the Situation if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or harm her children. Therefore, the deaths and injuries found on both Andy and Ben would be attributed to other causes, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

4. **Understanding the Injuries and Their Implications**: The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma. If Jane is not guilty, these injuries would not be a result of her actions. The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is a significant observation.

5. **Considering the Possibility of Injuries Not Being Noted**: There are a few possibilities to consider:
   - The injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.
   - The injuries were present but not noted by the nurses.
   - The injuries occurred post-mortem.

6. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
   - If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not a result of her actions, it's plausible that the injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital or were not related to her actions.
   - Nurses might miss certain injuries, especially if they are not immediately life-threatening or if the examination does not specifically look for such injuries. However, significant injuries like those described (to the ribs, spinal cord, etc.) are typically notable.

7. **Making a Judgment**: The critical factor here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the focus shifts from her actions to other potential explanations for the injuries and deaths. The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries could suggest they were not present or not observable at the time.

Given the significant nature of the injuries described, it is somewhat unlikely that they were entirely missed by medical staff. However, it's also possible that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately apparent.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, it's crucial to understand that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes such as SIDS, as suggested in the background. The injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and on Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of potential non-accidental injury, which is a critical piece of evidence against Jane.

However, the question specifically asks us to assume Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries might have another explanation or might not be related to her actions.

The fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital introduces several possibilities:
1. The injuries could have been subtle or not immediately apparent.
2. The injuries might have occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.

Given that Jane is assumed not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where the injuries might not be directly related to her actions. The question then becomes about the likelihood that these injuries were not present at the time of hospital admission.

The injuries described are significant and would likely be detected during a thorough medical examination, especially in a hospital setting where infants are carefully assessed. However, it's possible that they were not immediately obvious or were not present at the time of admission.

To determine the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we must consider the nature of the injuries and the hospital's procedures. The injuries suggest a significant traumatic event or events. 

If we assume Jane is not guilty and consider that the injuries might have another cause or occurred post-admission, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of these alternative explanations.

Given the assumption of Jane's innocence and without specific evidence to suggest that the injuries occurred after hospital admission, we can still reason based on the information typically available in such cases.

The probability judgment should be based on the plausibility that significant injuries could be missed during initial hospital assessment and the likelihood of such injuries occurring post-admission.

Probability: 20
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and relevance of petechiae in cases of smothering.

Petechiae are often considered in the context of asphyxiation or smothering because they can be indicative of the struggle or increased venous pressure associated with such acts. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to another cause such as SIDS, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically involve the kind of force or asphyxiation that leads to petechiae.

The absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering or a similar form of asphyxiation. If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a cause like SIDS, it is reasonable to expect that Ben would not have injuries such as petechiae associated with smothering.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben is relatively high because it aligns with an alternative cause of death that does not involve smothering or similar mechanisms that could cause petechiae.

Probability: 80
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must analyze the given information and its implications.

If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of Ben's death and the nature of his injuries are not related to her actions.

The information provided states that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, which suggests that it could be consistent with a natural cause of death, such as SIDS, if Jane is not guilty.

Additionally, it is suggested that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This explanation aligns with a scenario where Ben's death was not caused by Jane's actions but by another cause, and the injuries were either a result of medical intervention or occurred after death.

Given these explanations, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben because they can be attributed to either natural causes or to the medical handling of Ben's case (resuscitation attempts).

Therefore, the likelihood that these findings are present in Ben, given Jane's innocence, is relatively high because they can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt.

Probability: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given context and explanations.

The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, this explanation provides a plausible cause for these injuries.

Resuscitation attempts, especially on infants, can sometimes result in injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during such procedures. A torn frenulum, bruising, and even internal injuries like blood in the lung can occur during vigorous or improper resuscitation attempts, although they are not common.

If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, it is plausible that the injuries found could be a result of the resuscitation efforts made to save him.

Therefore, given Jane's innocence and the plausible explanation that the injuries were caused by resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of finding such injuries in Andy is relatively high because it aligns with a scenario where medical intervention was attempted.

To determine the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. The question posits that if Jane is not guilty, how likely is it that these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.

2. **Considering the injuries and the timeline**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. The injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

3. **Analyzing the given information**: 
   - The injuries to Ben were discovered during an autopsy. 
   - These injuries were not observed by the nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital.

4. **Evaluating the possibility of injuries not being present at the hospital**:
   - The fact that nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest that the injuries were not visible or were not present at that time.
   - Autopsy findings often reveal internal injuries that are not visible externally.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering a scenario where the deaths and injuries might not be due to her actions.
   - The injuries found on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or might not have been visible externally when he was brought to the hospital.

6. **Likelihood of injuries not being present**:
   - If the injuries were due to some other cause unrelated to Jane's actions, and considering that some injuries (like internal ones) might not be immediately visible, it's plausible that they were not noticeable by the nurses.
   - However, certain injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids could potentially be visible.

7. **Conclusion**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on whether they could have occurred post-mortem or were not externally visible. Some of the described injuries (e.g., internal injuries like those to the ribs and spinal cord) might not be immediately visible. However, others (like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) could be more apparent.

Given these considerations and assuming Jane is not guilty, it is somewhat plausible that the injuries were either not present or not visible when Ben was brought to the hospital. However, this does not directly prove or disprove Jane's guilt or innocence.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To address this question, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the prosecution suggesting that she smothered them. The autopsy findings for Ben included injuries such as rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. For Andy, further examination after Ben's autopsy revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The question focuses on the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty.

3. **Considering the Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). In this case, we need to consider alternative explanations for their deaths and the nature of the injuries found.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The text mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries (as found in Ben) is not typical for SIDS.

5. **Analyzing the Injuries Not Being Noted by Nurses**: If the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital, it suggests either that the injuries were not present at the time or they were not visible/identifiable during the initial examination.

6. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
   - If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to some other cause (not necessarily SIDS, as the injuries contradict typical SIDS characteristics), the injuries on Ben need an alternative explanation.
   - Some injuries could potentially occur post-mortem or during the resuscitation efforts, though certain injuries like those described are concerning for inflicted trauma.
   - The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon initial presentation could imply they were not present or were not detectable at that time.

7. **Conclusion**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane is not guilty, hinges on the plausibility of alternative explanations for the injuries and the deaths. If we assume Jane's innocence, we are left with a scenario where the cause of death and the injuries are due to other factors.

However, the specific injuries described for Ben (and later found in Andy upon re-examination) are indicative of significant trauma, which is not characteristic of SIDS or typical medical conditions that would result in sudden death in infants. 

The probability that such significant injuries were not present or not detectable when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, is difficult to assess directly without more context on the nature of the injuries and the medical handling of Ben post-mortem.

Given the significant nature of Ben's injuries and assuming they are genuine and not fabricated, it is less likely that they were entirely absent or not detectable upon initial hospital presentation if they were indeed post-mortem or occurred very shortly before death.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

Firstly, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, potentially aligning with the alternative explanation of SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

The injuries found on Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries that would likely be noticeable upon examination, especially in the context of a medical setting.

However, the fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important piece of information. There are a few possibilities to consider:

1. **Injuries occurred after hospital admission**: If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the injuries occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital. However, hospitals have protocols and monitoring in place, especially for critically ill infants, making it less likely for such significant injuries to go unnoticed if they occurred post-admission.

2. **Injuries were present but not noticed**: Another possibility is that the injuries were present upon admission but were not detected by the nurses or medical staff. This could be due to the nature of the injuries, the thoroughness of the initial examination, or the fact that the primary focus was on resuscitation efforts.

3. **Misinterpretation of the injuries**: There's also a possibility that the injuries were misinterpreted or not directly related to the cause of death or the events leading to it.

Given that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of these scenarios. If we assume Jane's innocence and consider SIDS or another non-inflicted cause of death, the presence of significant injuries as described becomes less directly related to Jane's actions.

However, the injuries found on Ben, as described, are indicative of significant trauma, which is not typically associated with SIDS. SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The fact that the injuries were not noted initially could suggest they were not immediately apparent or were not present at the time of admission. However, given the severity of the injuries described, it's reasonable to question how they could have been missed if they were present.

If Jane is not guilty and the injuries are considered, one must consider alternative explanations for both the deaths and the injuries. However, the presence of such significant injuries typically points towards a non-SIDS cause.

The probability judgment regarding the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, is challenging without more specific information about the nature of the medical examination and the timing of when the injuries were identified.

However, given the context and information available:

**60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the scenario under the assumption that Jane is innocent. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Ben was found unwell, and an ambulance was called. Despite attempts at resuscitation, he was pronounced dead. The autopsy later revealed injuries.

2. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by the nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. This indicates that either the injuries were not visible or were not significant enough to be noticed during the initial examination.

3. **Possible Explanations**:
   - **Injuries Occurred During Resuscitation**: It's possible that the injuries sustained by Ben occurred during the resuscitation efforts. Medical procedures, especially those involving CPR or other life-saving interventions, can sometimes cause injuries, including rib fractures or other internal injuries, especially in infants whose bones are more pliable and fragile.
   - **Injuries Not Immediately Apparent**: Some injuries, especially internal ones or those covered by clothing or not immediately visible upon cursory examination, might not be noticed right away.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, the injuries to Ben must have another explanation. One plausible explanation is that they occurred during the medical intervention (resuscitation attempts).
   - The injuries found on Ben could be a result of the medical efforts to save his life, which would not have been present before the hospital visit but occurred afterward.

5. **Probability Judgment**:
Given the information that Jane is not guilty, it's plausible that the injuries were sustained during the resuscitation efforts or were not immediately noticeable. The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is relatively high if we consider that they could have occurred during the attempts to resuscitate him.

Therefore, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, is quite high because it is plausible that they occurred post-admission during medical intervention.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The prosecution's case relies heavily on the autopsy findings of both children, which suggested injuries indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.

2. **The Injuries Found on Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are critical in determining the cause of death and potentially linking it to Jane's actions.

3. **Nurses Not Noting Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is significant. It implies one of two things: either the injuries were not visible or present at the time of hospitalization, or they were missed by the medical staff.

4. **Assessing Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). In this scenario, the injuries found on Ben need to be explained by other means.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are working under the assumption that the children's deaths were not due to her actions. The presence of injuries on Ben that were not noted by nurses could be due to several factors:
- The injuries could have occurred post-mortem or during the autopsy process itself.
- The injuries might have been internal or not immediately visible, thus not apparent during the initial examination at the hospital.
- Alternatively, if the deaths were due to another cause (like SIDS, though the autopsy findings contradict this for Ben), the injuries might be unrelated to the cause of death or Jane's actions.

However, the specific injuries described (to the ribs, spinal cord, etc.) are generally indicative of significant trauma. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we must consider alternative explanations for these injuries. 

The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries upon Ben's arrival at the hospital is crucial. For the injuries to have been missed, they must either have been not externally visible or not present at that time.

Considering these factors and assuming Jane's innocence, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards a plausible explanation that they could have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately visible/detectable.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, and one possible explanation is that they died of SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical of SIDS. 

If we assume Jane is not guilty, then the presence of these injuries on Ben suggests that they might have occurred post-mortem or were not directly related to Jane's actions. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply several things: the injuries were not visible or were not present at the time, or they were missed by the nurses.

However, it's crucial to consider the nature of the injuries and the likelihood of them being missed. The injuries described are significant and not subtle. If such injuries were present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it would be expected that they would be noticed by medical professionals, especially given the thorough examination that typically occurs in cases where a baby is brought in deceased or critically ill.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty, hinges on understanding that the absence of a notation of these injuries by nurses doesn't necessarily mean they were not present but could mean they were not observed or documented.

However, if we consider the possibility that these injuries could have occurred post-mortem, or that they were not easily observable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, it's still a complex scenario. The post-mortem examination revealed these injuries, suggesting they were significant enough to be identified during an autopsy.

Given Jane's innocence, if we are to believe that the injuries occurred post-mortem or were not directly related to her actions, and considering the medical professionals would likely have noticed significant injuries, the likelihood that the injuries were not present or not observable when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards a plausible scenario, especially if we entertain the idea that they could have occurred after hospitalization or were not easily detectable at the time.

However, the exact likelihood depends on various factors, including the nature of the injuries, the timing, and the handling of Ben's body post-mortem.

Probability judgment: 60
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not a result of her actions. The injuries found on Andy, including bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the presence of such injuries could still be explained by the vigorous resuscitation attempts made to save his life. Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during the procedure.

Medical literature and practice acknowledge that certain injuries can occur during resuscitation efforts, especially in infants. The injuries found on Andy are consistent with the type that could occur during resuscitation attempts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries found on Andy were a result of the resuscitation efforts. 

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any actions by Jane. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is consistent with this scenario.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence is not definitive proof, and their absence does not rule out asphyxiation. The presence or absence of petechiae can depend on various factors, including the nature and duration of the asphyxiation.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, as could be the case if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae and other typical injuries associated with smothering would be expected. SIDS deaths are typically characterized by a lack of significant pathological findings, and the absence of specific signs of asphyxiation, such as petechiae, is consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben is likely.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are significant findings that need to be considered in the context of Jane's guilt or innocence.

The information provided suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. 

If Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with this scenario, as it is described as a common finding in natural death.

Similarly, if the dislocated ribs occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, this would also be consistent with a scenario where Jane is not guilty. Resuscitation attempts can sometimes result in injuries, and post-mortem handling can also lead to certain types of injuries or damage.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or circumstances unrelated to Jane's actions.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Injuries**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries in question include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are consistent with the kind of trauma or stress that can occur during vigorous resuscitation efforts, especially in infants whose tissues are very delicate.

2. **Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries found on Andy could plausibly be the result of resuscitation attempts. In infants, resuscitation can sometimes cause injuries due to the fragility of their tissues. The fact that these injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts suggests that they are not uncommon in such scenarios.

3. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The question posits that if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother the children), then the deaths could be attributed to SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not directly linked to specific injuries like those found on Andy. However, SIDS does not typically present with the kind of injuries described.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were due to natural causes or accidents, such as SIDS. The presence of injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not typical for SIDS. However, the initial explanation that these injuries were due to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible alternative explanation that is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding smothering.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy would still need an explanation. If we accept that the injuries could be due to resuscitation attempts (as initially thought), then their occurrence is plausible even if Jane is not guilty of smothering.

Therefore, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy, given that Jane is not guilty, depends on how plausible it is that the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts or another accidental cause not related to Jane's actions.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

This judgment reflects a moderate likelihood that the injuries could be explained by factors other than Jane's guilt (e.g., resuscitation attempts), assuming she is not guilty. It acknowledges that while the injuries are not typical for SIDS, they could be attributed to other causes.

**60**
To evaluate the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context provided and the information about the injuries and their possible causes.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Injuries**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are consistent with the kind of trauma that could occur during vigorous resuscitation efforts, especially in infants whose bones and tissues are fragile.

2. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: The deaths of both Andy and Ben are considered in the context of SIDS, a condition where infants die suddenly and without a clear cause. SIDS is more common among boys and occurs in about 1 in 4,000 cases in the UK.

3. **Evaluating the Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The critical question then is whether the injuries found in Andy could be explained by factors other than smothering or maltreatment.

4. **Resuscitation Attempts as a Cause**: The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. This is a plausible explanation, given that such injuries can occur during the resuscitation of infants due to the fragility of their tissues.

5. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it means the death and injuries could be due to other factors, such as SIDS or accidental causes during resuscitation. The presence of injuries that could be attributed to resuscitation efforts provides a plausible alternative explanation for Andy's condition.

Considering the information and focusing on the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to assess the probability that these injuries occurred due to resuscitation attempts or are otherwise unrelated to Jane's actions.

Given that the injuries could plausibly be the result of resuscitation attempts, and assuming Jane is not guilty implies that the deaths were due to natural or accidental causes rather than intentional acts, the likelihood of such injuries occurring becomes more plausible as an accidental consequence rather than an intentional act.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

Firstly, it's given that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, can be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts, especially in infants. 

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her but could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

The initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death, which could be interpreted as SIDS or another natural cause, given that no clear evidence of foul play was identified at the time.

The subsequent discovery of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation for Andy's injuries if we assume Jane's innocence. The injuries could be a result of the medical intervention (resuscitation attempts) rather than an act of violence by Jane.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of Andy having injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high because such injuries can occur during vigorous attempts to revive the infant.

The presence of petechiae is often considered a potential indicator of smothering or asphyxiation, as they can result from the increased venous pressure during a struggle or the act of smothering itself. However, the absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering or asphyxiation.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Ben and Andy could be due to other causes such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

The injuries found in Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are significant and indicate a severe traumatic event. However, the absence of petechiae in this context could be seen as consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering.

SIDS, as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths, is characterized by the lack of a clear cause of death upon autopsy. The absence of typical signs of smothering like petechiae could be seen as more consistent with SIDS or another natural cause if Jane is not guilty.

Given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not have specific markers, the absence of petechiae or other signs typically associated with smothering could be consistent with a SIDS diagnosis or another natural cause.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high because it aligns with the possibility that Ben's death was not due to smothering.

Probability judgment: 90
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries found on Ben could be the result of an accident, a medical condition, or another cause not related to Jane's actions.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not present at that time or they were not readily observable.

If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the injuries occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital, potentially during the resuscitation attempts or due to other medical interventions.

However, it's also possible that the injuries were present but not immediately apparent or not significant enough to be noticed by the nurses during the initial examination, especially if the focus was on immediate care and resuscitation.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, would depend on the specifics of the case, including the timing and nature of the injuries.

However, given that the injuries were significant (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it is somewhat less likely that they occurred after hospital admission without being related to the medical handling or an event post-admission.

If the injuries were due to an event or condition before the hospital visit, and Jane is not guilty, it could imply that the injuries were either not present or not observable at the time of admission.

Probability judgment: 40
If Jane is not guilty, it means that the deaths of Ben and the injuries found on him are not attributed to her actions.

The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death. This implies that the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with a natural cause of death or a non-traumatic event.

Additionally, it's suggested that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This explanation provides a plausible alternative cause for the dislocated ribs that is not related to Jane's guilt.

If Jane is not guilty, and considering the explanations that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, it becomes more plausible that these findings are consistent with the circumstances of Ben's death being unrelated to Jane's actions.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is quite likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben because these findings can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt.

To determine the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we first need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of smothering her two children. The second child, Ben, showed injuries consistent with possible smothering or significant trauma (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids). However, typical signs associated with smothering, like petechiae, were not found.

2. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often considered a sign associated with smothering or asphyxiation due to the increased venous pressure causing rupture of small blood vessels. However, their presence is not universal in smothering deaths, and their absence does not rule out smothering.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense or alternative explanation is that both children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. The presence of injuries in Ben (and retrospectively found in Andy) complicates this, as SIDS does not typically present with such injuries.

5. **Petechiae in the Context of SIDS or Natural Death**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause (and not smothering), the expectation would be that there are no signs of smothering, including petechiae, because the death was not due to asphyxiation or smothering. 

6. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae**: Given that petechiae are associated with smothering or asphyxiation, if Jane is not guilty (implying no smothering occurred), it is expected that Ben would not have petechiae or other signs of smothering. Thus, the absence of petechiae is consistent with a natural death or SIDS.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to a natural cause like SIDS, the absence of petechiae in Ben is likely because SIDS or natural causes do not typically involve the mechanisms that lead to petechiae.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context of the case and the information provided about SIDS and smothering.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane.

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering:**
   - **SIDS** is a diagnosis of exclusion, given when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy.
   - **Smothering** involves asphyxia due to mechanical obstruction of the nose and mouth, which can result in specific autopsy findings such as petechiae, though their absence doesn't rule out smothering.

2. **Injuries Found and Not Found:**
   - Ben's autopsy showed injuries (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) that could be indicative of a violent or traumatic cause of death, potentially supporting the prosecution's hypothesis of smothering or another form of abuse.
   - The absence of petechiae, a common finding in some asphyxial deaths, is noted. Petechiae are not universally present in smothering deaths; their presence or absence can depend on various factors, including the specific mechanism of asphyxia.

3. **Evaluating the Absence of Petechiae if Jane is Not Guilty:**
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death is not smothering or any form of intentional act by her. 
   - In such a case, if we are considering SIDS or another natural cause for the deaths, the expectation is that there should not be significant traumatic injuries as found in Ben.
   - The presence of significant injuries in Ben (and potentially in Andy upon re-examination) already deviates from what is typically expected in SIDS, which is characterized by a lack of significant findings at autopsy.

4. **Likelihood of the Absence of Petechiae:**
   - The absence of petechiae is not particularly supportive or dismissive of SIDS since SIDS is not typically associated with such specific asphyxial signs; it's more about the overall context and exclusion of other causes.
   - If we are to believe that Jane is not guilty and that the cause of death is something other than smothering (like SIDS), the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically present with such findings.

Given the scenario and the information, if Jane is not guilty and thus not responsible for smothering her children, the absence of petechiae in Ben is quite likely because SIDS or another natural cause of death (if it were the case) would not necessarily present with such signs of asphyxia.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural cause, rather than smothering.

Petechiae are often associated with smothering or asphyxiation because they can result from the pressure applied to the chest or neck, obstructing blood vessels and causing them to rupture. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not a definitive indicator of smothering; many cases of smothering do not result in petechiae.

The absence of petechiae in Ben's autopsy, despite other injuries being present (like injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), suggests that if Jane were guilty of smothering Ben, the method or circumstances might not have led to the typical signs associated with smothering, such as petechiae.

However, the question is about the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering the scenario where Ben's death is not due to smothering but potentially due to SIDS or another cause. SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of significant injuries (like those described for Ben) would typically not be characteristic of SIDS.

The key here is understanding that if Ben's death was not due to smothering (Jane not being guilty), the absence of petechiae is expected because petechiae are more associated with the act of smothering. The injuries found on Ben are not typical for SIDS, suggesting a different cause, but the question is focused on the absence of petechiae.

Given that petechiae are associated with smothering and Jane is assumed not guilty (implying no smothering), it is reasonable to expect the absence of petechiae. 

Therefore, the likelihood of not finding petechiae if Jane is not guilty (and thus Ben's death is not due to smothering) is relatively high because the scenario of Jane not being guilty aligns with the absence of evidence that is typically associated with smothering.

**Probability judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical findings related to smothering and SIDS.

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - **Smothering** is a form of asphyxia caused by obstruction of the external air passages. Injuries such as petechiae (tiny hemorrhages) can occur due to the increased pressure and struggle during the act. However, the presence or absence of such injuries can vary.
   - **SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)** is diagnosed when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, but it's associated with various risk factors.

2. **Analyzing the Scenario**:
   - Ben's autopsy revealed injuries (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) that were not initially found in Andy's post-mortem but were later identified upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs. The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben is notable.
   - The prosecution suggests Jane smothered both children. If Jane is not guilty, it implies the deaths could be due to another cause, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, and assuming both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained natural cause, we would not expect to find injuries typically associated with smothering (like petechiae) because there was no smothering.
   - The presence of certain injuries in Ben (and later found in Andy's re-examined autopsy) complicates the SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically, infants dying from SIDS do not have significant injuries.
   - However, the question focuses on the absence of petechiae, a specific injury sometimes associated with smothering. The absence of such injuries is consistent with a death not caused by smothering.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If Jane is not guilty (implying no smothering occurred), the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben would be expected because there was no smothering. 
   - Thus, given the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus, there's no smothering), the absence of petechiae is quite likely.

**Probability Judgment: 80**

This judgment reflects a high likelihood that, if Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering her children), Ben would not have the typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae. The probability is not 100 because there could be other, less likely explanations or variations in how smothering or other causes of death might present. However, under the assumption of innocence and an alternative cause of death like SIDS (despite the controversy around the injuries found), the absence of such injuries is considered likely.
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical implications.

First, let's consider the given information: Ben died, and the autopsy revealed injuries including those to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, no petechiae were found. Petechiae are often associated with smothering or asphyxiation because they can result from the pressure applied to the chest or neck, causing rupture of small blood vessels.

The absence of petechiae in a death potentially due to smothering or asphyxiation is not uncommon. The presence or absence of petechiae can vary greatly among cases of smothering. Their absence does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the mechanism of death and the physical response of the infant can vary.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to another cause, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The autopsy findings in SIDS cases are typically minimal or non-specific, and the presence of significant injuries like those found in Ben (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) would be unusual for a diagnosis of SIDS.

However, the question is asking us to consider the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty, not directly the likelihood of SIDS or smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering an alternative cause of death like SIDS, the absence of petechiae is expected because SIDS does not typically involve the kind of asphyxiation or trauma that leads to petechiae.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to a cause that doesn't involve smothering or similar traumatic asphyxia (like SIDS), the absence of petechiae would be expected.

The likelihood of the absence of petechiae, given that Jane is not guilty and considering an alternative, non-traumatic cause of death, is relatively high because such causes (e.g., SIDS) do not inherently involve the mechanisms that typically cause petechiae.

85
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the plausible causes of these findings.

The information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, which directly supports the notion that if Jane is not guilty (implying a natural cause of death), the presence of spinal bleeding is plausible.

Regarding the dislocated ribs, it's suggested that they probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts are a medical intervention that can sometimes cause injuries, including rib fractures or dislocations, especially in infants whose bones are more pliable and susceptible to injury.

If Jane is not guilty, implying that Ben's death was due to natural causes (such as SIDS), the presence of spinal bleeding is considered plausible as it's stated to be a common finding in natural death.

The dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes also becomes a plausible explanation if Jane is not guilty, as it aligns with the medical interventions that would have been performed in an attempt to save Ben's life.

Therefore, given that both findings have plausible explanations that are consistent with a natural death or medical intervention rather than a criminal act, the likelihood of these findings, if Jane is not guilty, is relatively high.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and plausible explanations.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was due to natural causes or other non-traumatic reasons. The injuries found (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are then not attributed to Jane's actions.

The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon Ben's arrival at the hospital suggests one of a few possibilities: (1) the injuries were not present or not visible at that time, or (2) they were present but not detected by the nurses.

If the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it could imply that they occurred during the hospitalization or after death. Post-mortem changes or handling during autopsy could potentially cause or contribute to some injuries.

Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming a natural cause of death or another non-traumatic reason, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital would depend on whether these injuries could have plausibly occurred post-mortem or were not detectable at the time of hospital admission.

The injuries described (especially the rib and spinal cord injuries) could potentially be attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling. However, some of these findings, like hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, are more likely related to the circumstances around the death rather than post-mortem handling.

If Jane is not guilty and the death was due to a natural cause, it's plausible that some of the injuries could have been caused or became apparent post-mortem. However, attributing all the injuries to post-mortem changes or handling might be challenging.

30
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given context and the plausible explanations for these injuries.

The injuries found in Andy were bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the force and technique used.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was due to natural causes or other non-traumatic reasons, such as SIDS. The presence of injuries could be attributed to other factors, including resuscitation attempts.

The information provided suggests that the injuries found in Andy could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, which supports the plausibility of these injuries occurring even if Jane is not guilty.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be plausibly explained by resuscitation attempts.

To determine the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and available information.

First, let's consider the spinal bleeding. It is stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben could be due to natural causes or SIDS, as suggested in the background. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, and spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, it is reasonable to expect that spinal bleeding could be found in Ben.

Second, regarding the dislocated ribs, it is mentioned that they probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that Ben's death was not due to her actions (like smothering), and thus, the dislocated ribs, if resulting from resuscitation attempts, would be a plausible outcome regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence since resuscitation attempts were made.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the findings of spinal bleeding (being common in natural death) and dislocated ribs (potentially due to resuscitation attempts) are plausible and not unexpected.

Given these considerations, the likelihood that these findings would be present if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because they can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt (natural death or SIDS, and medical intervention).

80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the relevance of petechiae in determining the cause of death.

Petechiae are often considered in the context of asphyxial deaths, including smothering, as they can be indicative of the struggle or the body's response to lack of oxygen. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death could be attributed to natural causes or SIDS, as suggested. In such cases, the absence of petechiae would be expected because these deaths are not typically associated with the same kind of asphyxial or traumatic stress that can cause petechiae.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is due to natural causes or SIDS, it is reasonable to expect the absence of petechiae or other injuries typically associated with smothering.

Given this context, the likelihood of not finding petechiae or similar injuries in Ben if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because the death would not be attributed to smothering or similar violent causes.

95
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death could be attributed to natural causes or SIDS. The injuries found on Ben, including the dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding, have been explained as potentially occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts (in the case of dislocated ribs) and being a common finding in natural death (in the case of spinal bleeding).

If the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, it's plausible that they were not present or not noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital but became apparent later during the autopsy.

The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon initial examination could be consistent with the explanation that they occurred during resuscitation attempts or were not immediately apparent.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and considering that the injuries could have resulted from resuscitation or post-mortem changes, it is reasonable to suggest that these injuries might not have been present or noticeable when Ben was first brought to the hospital.

80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context provided.

The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death could be attributed to natural causes or SIDS, and the injuries found could still be explained by the resuscitation attempts made to save him.

Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones. The fact that such injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts supports the notion that if Jane is not guilty (and thus Andy's death was due to natural causes or SIDS), the injuries could still have occurred during the attempts to revive him.

Therefore, the likelihood of finding such injuries in Andy if Jane is not guilty is plausible because they can be explained by the medical interventions undertaken.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben. The initial death of Andy was attributed to natural causes, but after the death of Ben and subsequent autopsy, further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries that were not initially considered significant.

## Step 2: Identify the injuries found in Andy and their initial interpretation
The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 3: Consider the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm by Jane. The injuries found in Andy could be due to other causes, including resuscitation attempts as initially thought.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts or other accidental means
Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and such injuries are consistent with revival attempts, especially in babies, it's plausible that these injuries occurred during the efforts to save Andy's life.

## Step 5: Evaluate the relevance of SIDS as an alternative explanation
SIDS is an alternative explanation for the deaths, but the presence of injuries in both Andy and Ben complicates this explanation, especially for Ben where more severe injuries were found. However, the question focuses on the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty.

## Step 6: Consider the probability of Andy's injuries occurring by chance or due to resuscitation if Jane is not guilty
Since the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts, and given that Andy's death was initially thought to be due to natural causes ( potentially SIDS), the likelihood of these injuries being coincidental or related to medical intervention is considered.

## Step 7: Make a judgment on the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death and injuries could be attributed to other factors such as SIDS or accidental injuries during resuscitation. The injuries found could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts, which are not uncommon in cases where medical professionals are trying to revive an infant.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood
Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation and there's a plausible explanation that they occurred during such attempts, the likelihood that Andy's injuries occurred (given Jane is not guilty) is relatively high because it aligns with the initial interpretation and the context of medical intervention.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered during the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries were not a result of her actions (e.g., smothering). 

- **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung**: These injuries could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts. If we assume Jane is not guilty, then the presence of these injuries could be attributed to the medical interventions (like CPR) performed on Andy.

The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000, and while it is more common among boys, the exact cause or mechanism is unidentified. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or another natural cause as the reason for the deaths, the presence of injuries could be seen as a result of the attempts to revive the infant.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts (and not due to any inflicted trauma by Jane) is plausible. The fact that the initial autopsy did not reveal these injuries and they were only noted upon further review after Ben's autopsy findings suggests that they might not have been immediately obvious or considered significant in the context of the initial cause of death.

Considering the injuries could be a result of resuscitation efforts and assuming Jane's innocence, the presence of these injuries is not necessarily inconsistent with a natural death or SIDS, especially if they were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

The probability that the injuries found in Andy are due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes, given Jane is not guilty, is relatively high because there's an alternative explanation for the injuries that doesn't involve Jane's guilt.

**80**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The problem involves determining the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty of murdering him. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the initial assessment of Andy's injuries
Initially, Andy's injuries were thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. This implies that the injuries could be consistent with medical intervention.

## Step 3: Analyze the possibility of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts
If Jane is not guilty, it means Andy's death was not due to smothering by Jane. The injuries found could then be more likely related to other factors such as the resuscitation attempts or possibly SIDS, although SIDS itself does not directly cause such injuries.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the injuries given Jane's innocence
Given that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely it is for Andy to have the injuries found (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if they were not caused by her actions (e.g., smothering). The injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability based on the information about resuscitation attempts and SIDS
Since the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that SIDS is an unexplained death and not directly associated with such injuries, the presence of these injuries suggests that they could be related to the medical response to Andy's condition.

## Step 6: Consider the frequency and nature of SIDS and resuscitation-related injuries
SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not directly cause the injuries described. However, resuscitation attempts can cause such injuries. If Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause and was then subjected to vigorous resuscitation, the injuries could be a result of these attempts.

## Step 7: Determine the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the injuries could still occur due to resuscitation attempts. The key is understanding that resuscitation can cause such injuries.

## Step 8: Assess the probability
The injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts. The fact that they were initially attributed to such attempts suggests that they are plausible outcomes of medical intervention following a sudden infant death.

## Step 9: Quantify the likelihood
Given that the injuries can be explained by resuscitation attempts and assuming Jane's innocence implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions, we need to consider how common such injuries are in the context of resuscitation.

## Step 10: Provide a probability judgment
The exact probability depends on the likelihood of such injuries occurring during resuscitation attempts for an infant. While not all resuscitation attempts result in these specific injuries, they are recognized complications. Thus, if Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was followed by resuscitation attempts, the presence of these injuries, although potentially alarming, could be consistent with vigorous medical intervention.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy results that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. 

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her. If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means.

The injuries could be attributed to the resuscitation attempts made on Andy. If we assume that Jane is not guilty and that Andy's death was not due to smothering, then the injuries found could still be a result of the medical intervention during resuscitation attempts.

Since we are assuming Jane is not guilty, we have to rely on the alternative explanations for Andy's injuries. The fact that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation.

The likelihood of these injuries being present if Jane is not guilty depends on how probable it is that the resuscitation attempts caused these injuries.

The probability judgment should reflect how likely it is to observe these injuries under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and that the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries. This suggests that the initial assessment might not have captured the full extent or nature of Andy's injuries, or they were not considered significant enough to alter the cause of death.

2. **Injuries Found**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. 

3. **Attribution of Injuries**: Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The scenario implies that such injuries could be consistent with efforts to revive Andy.

4. **Jane's Guilt or Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (in this case, smothering). 

5. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The alternative explanation given is SIDS. However, SIDS is generally understood to be a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes of death are ruled out. The presence of injuries in both Andy and Ben complicates the SIDS diagnosis for both.

6. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other factors. The initial attribution of these injuries to resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation. 

The critical question is how likely it is for the described injuries to occur during resuscitation attempts on an infant. Medical literature and expert testimony often clarify that certain injuries can indeed occur during resuscitation efforts, though the frequency and severity can vary.

Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation efforts, and assuming that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), the presence of such injuries could be seen as consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if we are to consider Jane's innocence.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

This judgment is based on the assumption that if Jane is not guilty, the injuries could plausibly be attributed to the resuscitation attempts, as initially thought. The probability is not 100 because the presence and nature of the injuries still need to be reconciled with the overall context, including the likelihood of SIDS or other natural causes being misclassified or misunderstood initially. However, it reflects a reasonable likelihood given the information provided and the initial attribution of the injuries to resuscitation efforts.

**60**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Explanation for Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. The question posits that if Jane is not guilty, we need to assess how likely these injuries are.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts as a Cause**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). In this case, one possible explanation for the injuries is the resuscitation attempts. The injuries found (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) can be consistent with vigorous resuscitation efforts, although the presence and severity of such injuries can vary.

4. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: The background information also mentions SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries in both Andy and Ben upon further examination makes SIDS less likely as an explanation for their deaths, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy could potentially be attributed to resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes and that the injuries were only identified upon re-examination of the autopsy photographs after Ben's suspicious death suggests that the injuries might not have been immediately obvious or considered significant at the time.

However, it's crucial to consider the medical consensus and evidence regarding the likelihood of such injuries being caused by resuscitation attempts versus other causes.

**Likelihood Judgment**: Given that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying no intentional harm), the likelihood of these injuries being present due to resuscitation efforts is considered.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To address this question, let's analyze the information provided and break down the key points.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Injuries**: The injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. Injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can be consistent with vigorous resuscitation efforts, especially in infants whose bones and tissues are fragile.

2. **Understanding the Injuries**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to handling during resuscitation attempts.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is a common injury in infants during resuscitation or even during normal handling if it involves some force or accident, though it's more typically associated with direct trauma to the mouth.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of trauma or could be related to the resuscitation efforts or other factors.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any intentional act by her.
   - The injuries found on Andy were initially thought to be due to natural causes and later reevaluated after Ben's autopsy findings raised suspicions.
   - If Jane is innocent, then the finding of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts becomes more plausible as an explanation for Andy's injuries.

4. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**:
   - SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly explain the injuries found. However, if Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the injuries could still be attributed to resuscitation attempts.

Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and there's a plausible explanation that they occurred during such efforts, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are due to resuscitation attempts rather than an intentional act is increased.

Therefore, considering the information and the context that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries are due to resuscitation attempts is relatively high because it aligns with the scenario where Jane did not intentionally harm Andy.

**80**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the injuries found.
Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Consider the context of resuscitation attempts and their potential to cause the observed injuries.
Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes result in injuries due to the vigorous nature of the procedures. The injuries found on Andy could be consistent with such attempts.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to smothering by her. In this case, the injuries found on Andy would more likely be attributed to other causes, such as resuscitation attempts or possibly SIDS if it were directly related to the injuries (though SIDS itself doesn't directly cause injuries, it might be considered in the context of accidental or unexplained deaths).

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the injuries being a result of resuscitation attempts.
Given that the initial autopsy suggested natural causes and the injuries were later found, it's plausible that these injuries could have occurred during resuscitation efforts. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts.

## Step 5: Consider the frequency and implications of SIDS.
SIDS is a condition where infants die suddenly without a clear cause. While it's more common among boys and has a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK, the presence of specific injuries (like those found in Andy and Ben) complicates the attribution of their deaths solely to SIDS.

## Step 6: Evaluate the likelihood of Andy's injuries given that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Andy could be explained by resuscitation attempts. The fact that initial autopsy results suggested natural causes and later findings showed injuries doesn't directly imply guilt without considering alternative explanations for these injuries.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood based on the information provided.
The injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts. Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are due to resuscitation, we need to consider how likely it is for such injuries to occur during resuscitation.

## Step 8: Provide a probability judgment.
Considering that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and that there's an alternative explanation for the deaths (SIDS), if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of Andy having such injuries due to resuscitation is plausible.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries. These injuries included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Attribution of Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. The scenario suggests that such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby.

3. **Understanding the Injuries**: 
   - Bruises to the arms and legs could be indicative of trauma or could potentially be related to other factors including resuscitation efforts, though the latter is less likely to cause bruising on limbs.
   - A torn frenulum is often associated with a significant force or trauma to the mouth area.
   - Blood in the lung could be related to various factors, including resuscitation efforts or other forms of trauma.

4. **Resuscitation Attempts as an Explanation**: If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries could potentially be attributed to the resuscitation attempts or other accidental means. However, the presence of a torn frenulum and bruising is not typically characteristic of standard resuscitation procedures, which might involve some force but not usually to the extent of causing such injuries.

5. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The deaths could be attributed to SIDS, as suggested. SIDS is by definition an unexplained death, and there is no clear evidence linking SIDS directly to the kind of injuries found in Andy. While it's possible for an infant to die from SIDS, the presence of the injuries described would be unusual and not directly related to SIDS.

Given the above considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation or accidental means (and not indicative of smothering or other non-accidental injury) is a complex assessment. The injuries described are not typical for standard resuscitation attempts, suggesting that either they were not solely due to resuscitation or there was some other factor at play.

However, without direct evidence linking the injuries to Jane's actions or omissions beyond reasonable doubt, and assuming she is not guilty, one might infer that the injuries could be due to other causes or misinterpretation.

To provide a probability judgment on the likelihood of these injuries if Jane is not guilty (and assuming the injuries are not indicative of her guilt), we have to consider that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation and that there's an element of uncertainty.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. This implies that there were no obvious signs of trauma or injury that would have indicated foul play or unnatural death at the time of the first autopsy.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: Upon re-examination based on autopsy photographs, bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were discovered. 

3. **Attribution of Injuries**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. Injuries such as bruising, a torn frenulum, and internal injuries can occur during resuscitation efforts, especially in infants whose bones and tissues are fragile.

4. **SIDS as a Cause of Death**: SIDS is a possible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out, and it remains a diagnosis of exclusion.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. 

The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of such injuries could still be explained by the resuscitation efforts made to save Andy.

The probability that Andy had such injuries is plausible if we consider that resuscitation attempts were made and these can cause the kind of injuries described.

Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries being present if Jane is not guilty (and thus Andy's death being due to a cause other than smothering by Jane) depends on the likelihood that resuscitation attempts could result in such injuries.

Given the context and the medical intervention that occurred, it is reasonable to consider that the injuries could be a result of resuscitation attempts. Hence, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that Andy could still have such injuries due to the medical efforts to revive him.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the injuries found.
Andy was initially thought to have died of natural causes, but further examination after Ben's death revealed injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The injuries found in Andy could then be considered in the context of resuscitation attempts or other accidental causes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the plausibility of the injuries being caused by resuscitation attempts.
Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries, including bruising, rib fractures, and other internal injuries, due to the force and technique used. A torn frenulum can occur if the baby's mouth is opened forcibly during resuscitation attempts. Blood in the lung could be related to various factors including resuscitation.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the injuries found in Andy given that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely it is for an infant to have such injuries during resuscitation attempts. While resuscitation can cause some injuries, the presence of multiple types of injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation efforts, though it is not common for all these injuries to occur together solely due to resuscitation.

## Step 5: Consider the baseline frequency of SIDS and the context.
The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000, and it is more common among boys. However, the presence of injuries complicates the attribution of death solely to SIDS.

## Step 6: Relate the given injuries to the likelihood of being caused by resuscitation or other non-criminal factors if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation or other non-intentional causes. The likelihood of these specific injuries occurring due to resuscitation attempts is a critical factor.

## Step 7: Evaluate the probability based on the information provided and known medical practices.
Given that resuscitation attempts can cause some of these injuries, and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths might be due to SIDS or another natural/accidental cause), we must consider how plausible it is for Andy's injuries to have occurred during attempted resuscitation.

## Step 8: Final consideration of the probability.
The injuries found in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) could be seen as consistent with resuscitation attempts, though the combination and severity might be considered unusual. However, the exact probability depends on the specifics of the resuscitation attempts and the medical evaluation of the injuries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's injuries and the initial explanation for them.
The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The injuries found in Andy could then be considered in the context of resuscitation attempts or other accidental causes.

## Step 3: Assess the plausibility of the injuries being caused by resuscitation attempts.
Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries such as bruising, rib fractures, or other internal injuries due to the force applied during chest compressions or other maneuvers. However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum might not be directly attributed to standard resuscitation techniques.

## Step 4: Evaluate the probability based on the information given and the context of resuscitation attempts.
Given that Andy's injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts, we need to consider how likely it is for such injuries to occur during resuscitation. While some injuries like rib fractures are known to occur during CPR on infants, others like a torn frenulum are less commonly associated with it but can happen due to various factors including accidental injury during the process.

## Step 5: Consider the specific injuries mentioned and their relation to resuscitation.
A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, but it can also occur accidentally. The presence of bruises and blood in the lung could be related to resuscitation efforts or other factors.

## Step 6: Assess the overall likelihood of the injuries given that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries could be attributed to other causes, including resuscitation attempts or possibly other accidental means. The key is understanding that if the deaths were not due to smothering, the injuries might still be consistent with the medical interventions or other explanations.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood based on the given context.
The frequency and type of injuries can give us a clue. For instance, if resuscitation attempts can plausibly explain some or all of the injuries, then the likelihood of these injuries occurring given that Jane is not guilty would be higher.

## Step 8: Provide a final probability judgment.
Given the context that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that some injuries could be consistent with such attempts, we need to consider how plausible this explanation is.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the explanations provided for the injuries.

1. **Initial Assessment and Autopsy Findings for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were only discovered after further examination following Ben's autopsy.

2. **Explanation for the Injuries**: The injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be consistent with attempts to revive a baby, as these are known complications of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on infants.

3. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or harm her children. In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy need an alternative explanation. 

Given that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and assuming these attempts were made in good faith to save Andy's life, it's plausible that the injuries were a result of the medical intervention rather than any malicious act by Jane.

The probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts (and thus Jane not being guilty) depends on the likelihood that such injuries can occur during CPR. Research and medical literature suggest that injuries such as rib fractures and other internal injuries can occur during CPR on infants, although they are considered rare.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts is a plausible explanation.

**80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Injuries**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries in question include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Consistency with Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. This implies that the injuries found on Andy could plausibly be the result of the resuscitation efforts made when he was found unwell.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The scenario also presents SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is known for being a sudden and unexplained death in infants, typically within their first year.

4. **Assessing Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. In this case, we are left to consider the likelihood of the injuries found on Andy being due to other causes, primarily the resuscitation attempts.

Given that the injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts and that SIDS is an unexplained phenomenon that doesn't directly imply foul play or specific injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Andy are plausible as a result of medical intervention (resuscitation attempts).

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts or other non-foul play causes is relatively high because there's an alternative, plausible explanation for them.

Probability Judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the implications of her innocence.

1. **Understanding Petechiae**: Petechiae are small spots that occur due to bleeding from small blood vessels. They can be associated with various conditions, including smothering or asphyxiation, as they can result from increased venous pressure during a struggle or forced obstruction of the airway.

2. **Absence of Petechiae in Smothering Cases**: Not all cases of smothering result in petechiae. The presence or absence of petechiae can depend on various factors, including the method and duration of smothering, the force applied, and individual physiological responses.

3. **Ben's Autopsy Findings**: Ben's autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. While these findings are significant, the absence of petechiae is noted.

4. **Implication of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to her actions (smothering). In this scenario, the cause of death for both children could be attributed to other factors, such as SIDS or another medical condition.

5. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae**: Given that Jane is not guilty, and thus did not smother Ben, the absence of petechiae is expected because there was no smothering or asphyxiation caused by her. The presence or absence of petechiae becomes less relevant as the cause of death is attributed to other factors.

6. **Alternative Causes of Death**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be consistent with these diagnoses, as SIDS deaths typically do not present with signs of asphyxiation like petechiae.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is quite likely because there was no smothering or asphyxiation by Jane. The condition of Ben's body is consistent with an unexplained or natural death, which aligns with the scenario where Jane is not guilty.

Probability Judgment: 95
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and its implications.

1. **Spinal Bleeding in Natural Death**: It's stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. This implies that the presence of spinal bleeding in Ben could be consistent with a natural cause of death.

2. **Dislocated Ribs**: The dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem occurrence or as a result of resuscitation attempts. Both explanations are plausible and not necessarily indicative of foul play.

3. **Implication of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that Ben's death was not due to her actions (smothering or any other form of harm). In this scenario, the cause of Ben's death could be attributed to natural causes or other factors unrelated to Jane's actions.

4. **Likelihood of Findings**: Given that spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural deaths and dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation, the presence of these findings in Ben is consistent with a scenario where Jane is not guilty. 

5. **Consistency with Natural or Accidental Causes**: The explanations provided for the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs align with natural or accidental (during resuscitation) causes, supporting the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is quite plausible as they can be attributed to natural causes or resuscitation efforts.

Probability Judgment: 85
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the implications of her innocence.

1. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses upon Ben's arrival at the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not visible or they were not significant enough to be immediately noticeable.

2. **Implication of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben through smothering or any other form of harm.

3. **Possible Explanations for Injuries**: If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Ben could be attributed to other causes or could have occurred post-mortem.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present**: If the injuries were due to post-mortem changes or occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, it's plausible that they were not present or not noticeable when he was admitted.

5. **Post-Mortem Changes or Resuscitation**: The injuries (like dislocated ribs) could have occurred during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem. If so, it's likely they were not present or noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, and the injuries could be attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation efforts, it's plausible that the injuries were not present or noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital.

To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and the scenario assuming Jane is not guilty.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane's two sons, Andy and Ben, died under different circumstances that led to an investigation and eventually to Jane being charged with their murder. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben include damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and severe injuries.

3. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the injuries and the deaths could be attributed to other factors, potentially including SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not inflict the injuries on Ben. The question then becomes whether the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not observable by the nurses due to various reasons.

Given that the injuries were not noted by nurses, several possibilities exist:
- The injuries could have been internal and not immediately visible upon initial examination.
- The injuries might have occurred post-mortem, during autopsy procedures, or handling.
- The nature of the injuries might not have been immediately apparent without a detailed examination.

However, the presence of significant injuries like damage to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages, typically suggests that these were not superficial or easily missed injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths and injuries were not caused by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-mortem or being missed by medical staff.

**Medical professionals are trained to identify significant injuries or conditions upon initial examination.** While it's possible for some injuries to be missed, significant injuries such as those described are less likely to be entirely overlooked, especially if they were present and significant at the time of hospital admission.

However, the detailed nature of the autopsy findings versus the initial hospital examination could suggest that either the injuries were not visible or were not present at the time of admission.

**Probability Judgment**: Given the scenario and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital could be considered in the context of medical evidence handling and the nature of the injuries.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse. However, it's stated that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital.

2. **Assessing the given condition**: We are to assume Jane is not guilty. This means we are working under the assumption that she did not smother or harm her children.

3. **Considering alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

4. **Evaluating the injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben (to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are significant and could be associated with a traumatic event or a severe medical condition.

5. **The observation by nurses**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. It suggests one of two possibilities: either the injuries were not present at that time, or they were present but not observable or not noticed by the nurses.

6. **Likelihood assessment**: If Jane is not guilty and did not inflict the injuries, there are a few scenarios to consider:
   - The injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital. This is possible but seems unlikely given the context that the hospital environment is generally not associated with the kind of injuries Ben sustained, and there would likely be an investigation into how such injuries occurred in a hospital setting.
   - The injuries were present but not noticed by the nurses. This is plausible depending on the nature of the injuries and the circumstances under which they were examined.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are to assess the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we must consider the possibility that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were simply not observed. However, given the severity of the injuries (e.g., to the ribs and spinal cord), it is less likely they occurred post-mortem without being related to the cause of death or handling after death.

Given the information and context, if Jane is not guilty, it is somewhat plausible that the injuries were either not observed or not present. However, the probability of this being the case would depend heavily on the specifics of the hospital's procedures, the nature of the injuries, and when they could have occurred.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few factors based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding SIDS and the Injuries Found**: SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and internal damages (like those found in Ben and retrospectively in Andy) are not characteristic of SIDS. These injuries are more indicative of some form of trauma or abuse.

2. **Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not cause the injuries to Ben (and Andy). Therefore, the injuries must have occurred either before the hospital visit or be unrelated to the actual cause of death.

3. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply a few things:
   - The injuries were not present or visible at that time.
   - The injuries were present but not visible or detectable during a routine examination by nurses.
   - The nurses missed the injuries.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital:
- It must be assumed that some other factor or individual caused the injuries after Ben was brought to the hospital, which is highly unlikely given the controlled environment of a hospital.
- Alternatively, it could be considered that the injuries were there but not detected. However, significant injuries like those described (rib injuries, spinal cord damage) are typically identifiable during medical examination, especially in a hospital setting.

4. **Probability Assessment**: The scenario that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane's innocence, leans towards understanding that if Jane didn't cause the injuries, and if we are to believe she is innocent, the injuries must have been caused by some other means or were not related to Jane's actions.

However, the injuries described are severe and not typical of SIDS or accidental injuries that might occur in a home setting without being noticed. The fact that they were not noted by nurses is crucial. 

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider the possibility that the injuries were not present, it implies they occurred post-hospital admission, which is improbable due to the hospital's controlled environment and the nature of the injuries.

**Given these considerations**, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, is low because it stretches credibility to think that such significant injuries occurred post-admission without being detected or caused by someone else in a hospital setting.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of non-accidental trauma, such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. For Andy, further tests after Ben's autopsy revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben are significant and suggestive of a severe traumatic event. If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries, as well as the death of both children, could be attributed to other factors, such as SIDS or another unexplained or natural cause.

3. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important piece of information. There are several possible explanations for this:
   - The injuries were not visible or were not apparent at the time of hospital admission.
   - The injuries occurred after the hospital admission.
   - The medical staff did not properly examine or document the injuries.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. In this context, if we are to consider that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we have to assess the plausibility of this scenario.

Given the severity of the injuries (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord), it is less likely that they were not noticed by medical staff upon examination, unless they were not immediately visible or were internal injuries that did not manifest externally. However, some of these injuries, like hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, could potentially be observable.

If Jane is not guilty and someone or something else caused Ben's death and injuries, or if the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS (though SIDS does not typically present with such significant traumatic injuries), then the injuries being unnoticed by hospital staff might be plausible under certain conditions (e.g., if they were internal and not immediately externally visible).

However, given the detailed nature of the injuries described (especially external ones like hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it strains credibility to suggest they were entirely unnoticed by medical staff unless there was a specific reason they were not observed or documented.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, mainly because the described injuries are significant and should have been noted by medical staff unless there were extraordinary circumstances. However, the presence of some internal injuries could potentially explain why not all were immediately noted. The judgment takes into account the complexity and the unlikeliness of such severe injuries going completely unnoticed by medical professionals.
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider several factors and assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries found on Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and serious injuries that are not typical of a natural death or SIDS.

2. **Assumption of Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. 

3. **Examination by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is a crucial piece of information. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations. If the injuries were not noted, it could mean they were not present, not visible, or not significant enough to be detected during the initial examination.

4. **Nature of the Injuries**: The injuries described are serious and would likely have been evident upon a thorough medical examination, especially if they were recent. However, the severity and visibility of such injuries can vary.

5. **Alternative Explanation**: If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for Ben's death and injuries needs to be considered. SIDS is mentioned, but the injuries found are not typical of SIDS. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we must consider other potential causes or explanations for the injuries that do not involve Jane.

6. **Likelihood Assessment**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the credibility of the medical examination at the hospital and the nature of the injuries. 

- If the injuries were inflicted post-mortem or were not readily detectable at the time of the initial examination, it's possible they were not present or not noted.
- The fact that they were discovered during an autopsy suggests they could have been internal or not immediately visible.

Given these considerations and assuming Jane's innocence, we assess the likelihood based on the information that the injuries were not noted by nurses. 

The injuries being serious and discovered during an autopsy, it is plausible that they were not immediately evident to the nurses who examined Ben upon his arrival at the hospital. However, the critical factor here is whether these injuries could have been sustained post-mortem or were simply not detected.

Given the context and assuming Jane is not guilty, one might lean towards the possibility that the injuries were either not present or not detectable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, or that there was an oversight in the initial examination.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

2. **Considering the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben are significant and indicative of possible non-accidental trauma. However, the question posits a scenario where Jane is not guilty, suggesting we consider alternative explanations for the deaths and the injuries.

3. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. If the injuries were not noted, it could be because they were not present at the time or were not visible or significant enough to be noticed during the initial examination.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not a result of her actions, there are a few possibilities to consider:
    - The injuries could have been caused by someone or something else, but this would still imply some form of negligence or action leading to the injuries, which doesn't directly align with the "not guilty" premise unless it was an accident or unrelated to Jane's actions.
    - Alternatively, the injuries might not have been present or noticeable at the time of hospital admission.

Given that the injuries were discovered during the autopsy and not noted by nurses, if we are to assume Jane's innocence (implying the absence of her causing the injuries), the most plausible explanation is that the injuries either occurred after hospital admission or were not detectable during the initial examination.

However, autopsy findings like those described (especially injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages) are typically significant and would likely be identified or suspected during a medical examination unless they were very subtle or occurred post-mortem. 

The probability that these significant injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, hinges on whether one believes the injuries could have occurred post-admission or were simply not detected. The detailed nature of the injuries suggests they were significant and likely pre-mortem.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few aspects:

1. **Nature of the Injuries**: The injuries described for Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of significant trauma.

2. **SIDS vs. Inflicted Injury**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, but it does not typically involve significant traumatic injuries like those described for Ben. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause.

3. **Observation by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply several things: either the injuries were not present at that time, or they were present but not observable or not observed by the nurses.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are working under the assumption that the deaths were not due to her actions, and thus considering alternative explanations like SIDS.

However, the injuries described for Ben are not typical of SIDS. SIDS deaths are not usually associated with significant traumatic injuries. Therefore, if we are to assume Jane's innocence and attribute Ben's death to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of such injuries is contradictory.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital involves considering whether the injuries could have been inflicted post-mortem or were missed by the medical staff.

For the injuries to have not been present when Ben was brought to the hospital but were found during the autopsy, they would have had to occur post-mortem. Given the nature of the injuries (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, haemorrhages), it's implausible they occurred post-mortem in a manner that wouldn't be related to the cause of death or handling after death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and we are to believe the injuries were not indicative of her actions, the scenario that the injuries were not present and occurred post-mortem or were otherwise not related to her guilt is not strongly supported by the information given.

The probability judgment, in this case, hinges on the plausibility of the injuries being unrelated to Jane's actions if she is not guilty. Given the traumatic nature of the injuries and their discovery during autopsy, it is not highly likely that they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. The question posits that Jane is not guilty and asks us to evaluate the likelihood that the injuries on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.

2. **Analyzing the Information**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or some other natural or accidental cause. The injuries found on Ben suggest a violent or traumatic cause of death.

3. **Considering the Injuries**: The presence of injuries such as those to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids typically indicate significant trauma. If these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital, it raises questions about when these injuries occurred.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
    - If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the deaths were due to natural or unexplained causes (like SIDS), or an accident not related to Jane's actions.
    - However, the injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma, which is not characteristic of SIDS.
    - If Ben had these injuries before being brought to the hospital and they were not noted by the nurses, it could imply that either the injuries occurred very shortly before or after arrival at the hospital, or they were not easily observable.

5. **Probability Judgment**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are genuine and not fabricated, it is still challenging to directly link the absence of observed injuries by nurses to Jane's guilt or innocence without considering the timing and nature of the injuries. However, if we are to consider that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus implying someone or something else might be responsible or it was an accident), the likelihood that these injuries were not present hinges on the credibility of the medical observation and the timing of when the injuries could have occurred.

Given the context, if Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider alternative explanations for the deaths and injuries, the fact that nurses did not note the injuries doesn't directly relate to Jane's guilt or innocence but rather to the timing and detection of the injuries. If the injuries were not noted, it could be because they were not immediately visible or occurred after hospital admission, though the latter is less likely given the severe nature of the injuries described.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment is based on the reasoning that if Jane is not guilty and the injuries on Ben are real, for them not to have been noted by nurses, they would have had to either occur very shortly after admission or not be immediately visible. The low probability reflects the unlikeliness that such significant injuries would not be observed upon initial examination unless they were not present or not easily detectable at that time.
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and evidence.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the Injuries**: The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and internal damages in infants can be indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI). However, the absence of these injuries being noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest that either the injuries were not visible or they were not present at that time.

3. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or any other form of NAI). In this context, the injuries found on Ben need an alternative explanation.

4. **Alternative Explanations for the Injuries**: If Jane is innocent, then the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not correctly identified or documented by the medical staff. 

5. **Post-Mortem Injuries or Misinterpretation**: Some injuries, especially those that are internal or not immediately visible, might not be noticed during initial examination. The fact that nurses did not note the injuries does not definitively mean they were not present; it could mean they were not observable at the time.

6. **Assessing the Likelihood**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital involves several factors:
    - The nature of the injuries: Some injuries could occur post-mortem or be the result of medical procedures.
    - The medical handling and autopsy procedure: How the body was handled after death could potentially cause or contribute to some injuries.
    - The observational skills and thoroughness of the medical staff: Nurses and initial medical examiners might miss some injuries, especially if they are not immediately visible or if the staff were not expecting to find them.

7. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming SIDS or a similar natural cause is a plausible explanation for the deaths, the presence of injuries becomes an anomaly that needs explanation. SIDS itself doesn't cause injuries like those described; hence, if Jane is innocent, we'd be looking for an alternative, non-criminal explanation for the injuries.

8. **Conclusion**: Given that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital could be considered relatively high if we assume that the injuries could have been caused post-mortem or were not immediately visible or documented. However, the injuries described (e.g., hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) suggest significant trauma or distress before death, which complicates the SIDS explanation.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The injuries found on Ben (and later discovered on Andy through further examination of autopsy photographs) are critical to the case against her.

2. **Injuries found on Ben**: The injuries include damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of significant trauma.

3. **Nurses not noting the injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is significant. It suggests one of a few possibilities:
   - The injuries were not visible or were not apparent at the time of hospital admission.
   - The injuries occurred after hospital admission.
   - The medical staff did not adequately examine Ben for such injuries.

4. **Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm by her).

5. **Alternative explanation - SIDS**: The deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause if Jane is not guilty. However, the presence of significant injuries on Ben (and later found on Andy) complicates this explanation, as SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically involve significant traumatic injuries.

6. **Assessing the likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, the critical question is whether the injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital or if they were missed by the medical staff. 
   - It's highly unlikely that such significant injuries (to the ribs, spinal cord, brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurred during the hospital stay without being noticed, given the standard of care and observation in hospitals.
   - It's also unlikely that medical staff would completely miss such significant injuries upon initial examination, though it's possible that not all injuries were immediately apparent or documented.

7. **Probability Judgment**: Given Jane's innocence, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, one would have to believe that either the medical staff missed these significant injuries or they occurred post-admission. Both scenarios are unlikely but not impossible. However, the presence of such severe injuries makes it difficult to reconcile with a scenario where Jane is innocent and the deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, it's still relatively unlikely that the significant injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, mainly because the scenario of Jane's innocence is already strained by the presence of these injuries. The likelihood that these injuries were not present and were either missed or occurred post-admission is low, primarily because the injuries are severe and should have been noted.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, showed injuries during the autopsy that were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. The injuries include damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the injuries and their detection**: The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply that the injuries were not visible or were not present at that time. However, it's also possible that the injuries were present but not detected due to the condition Ben was in or the nature of the examination.

3. **Considering Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben are attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes. The presence of injuries on Ben (and retrospectively found on Andy) would then be considered as either not related to Jane's actions or as a misinterpretation of the cause of death.

4. **Evaluating the likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the injuries found on Ben were either not present or not detectable when he was brought to the hospital. This could be because they occurred post-mortem or were not visible during the initial examination.

Given that the task is to assess the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we have to consider the context and evidence.

The critical piece of information is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the injuries might not be related to her actions. However, it is also crucial to understand that the presence and timing of these injuries are pivotal in determining the cause of death and Jane's guilt or innocence.

The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries could suggest they were not easily visible or were not present. However, it is a complex issue because the autopsy findings are detailed and include significant trauma.

To simplify, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we are essentially exploring alternative explanations for the deaths and the injuries found. The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on various factors including the nature of the injuries and the thoroughness of the initial examination.

The injuries described are significant and, in many cases, such injuries would be expected to be detected or at least suspected during a medical examination, especially if they were significant enough to contribute to the cause of death.

However, without more specific information on the nature of the initial examination and the exact timing and nature of the injuries, we can only speculate.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

This judgment reflects a moderate likelihood, taking into account the complexity of the case and the factors that could influence whether the injuries were detected or not during the initial hospital examination. It acknowledges that while it's possible the injuries were not present or not detected, there's also a significant possibility they could have been present but not noted due to various reasons.
To evaluate the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few key points.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The injuries found on Ben (and later discovered on Andy through further examination of autopsy photographs) are critical to the case against her.

2. **The Nature of the Injuries**: The injuries include damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of significant trauma.

3. **Jane's Guilt or Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering or causing the injuries found).

4. **The Possibility of SIDS or Another Explanation**: The alternate explanation given is SIDS, which is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically involve significant traumatic injuries as described.

5. **The Observation by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important observation. If the injuries were not present or not observable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, it would suggest they occurred after hospitalization.

However, several factors need consideration:
- The severity of the injuries: Significant injuries like those described (rib and spinal cord damage, hemorrhages) are unlikely to be entirely unnoticed by medical professionals, even if they were not the immediate cause of death.
- The timing and nature of the injuries: If the injuries were perimortem (around the time of death), they could have been missed if not immediately apparent or if they were internal and not detectable through initial examination.
- Medical examination procedures: Hospitals have protocols for examining infants, but the thoroughness can vary based on the presentation and the condition of the infant upon arrival.

Given Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, one would have to consider that:
- Either the injuries were not present or were not detectable at the time of hospitalization.
- The injuries were sustained post-mortem or very shortly before death in a manner that was not immediately apparent to the medical staff.

However, the injuries described are significant and would likely be associated with a clinical presentation that would have raised concerns or been noted upon thorough examination.

To assess the likelihood, we consider:
- The probability that significant traumatic injuries were missed by medical staff is relatively low due to the severity of the injuries described.
- The possibility that these injuries occurred post-mortem or were not detectable is also a consideration.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that such significant injuries were not present or detectable when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty and considering the nature of the injuries and typical medical examination practices. However, it acknowledges that there could be exceptional circumstances or explanations that aren't detailed in the given scenario. 

20
To evaluate the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and medical aspects.

1. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often cited as a potential indicator of smothering or asphyxiation because they can result from the increased venous pressure during a struggle or forced obstruction of the airway. However, their presence is not universal in smothering deaths, and their absence does not rule out asphyxiation or smothering.

2. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death was not due to her actions (i.e., not smothering). The absence of petechiae in this context is more about the actual cause of death rather than the absence of smothering.

3. **Alternative Causes of Death**: The scenario suggests SIDS as an alternative explanation. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically without significant pathological findings like petechiae.

4. **Medical Findings on Ben**: Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries (rib and spinal cord damage, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), which are not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae:
- Is consistent with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering or asphyxiation caused by Jane.
- Does not directly support or refute SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically does not involve the significant traumatic injuries found on Ben.

The absence of petechiae is somewhat expected if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another cause not directly related to smothering. However, the presence of other significant injuries complicates the interpretation.

**Probability Judgment: 80**

This judgment reflects that if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was not due to smothering, the absence of petechiae is relatively likely, as petechiae are not a universal finding in all infant deaths, and their presence is more specifically associated with certain types of asphyxial deaths.

80
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given explanations for these findings.

1. **Spinal Bleeding**: If spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, this suggests that its presence in Ben could be consistent with a natural cause of death, rather than necessarily being indicative of trauma caused by Jane.

2. **Dislocated Ribs**: The explanation that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provides an alternative to the interpretation that they were caused by Jane's actions. Resuscitation attempts, which are a medical intervention, can sometimes cause injuries such as rib fractures.

3. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions. The presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, under the given explanations, could be consistent with natural causes or medical interventions rather than inflicted trauma.

Given the explanations:
- Spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural deaths makes its presence more plausible in the context of Jane's innocence.
- Dislocated ribs occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible alternative explanation for their presence, unrelated to Jane's actions.

**Probability Judgment: 80**

This judgment reflects that if Jane is not guilty, it is quite likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben, given the provided explanations that these findings can be associated with natural death or medical interventions rather than necessarily being indicative of inflicted trauma.

80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given context and explanations.

1. **Initial Attribution of Andy's Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. This suggests that they were considered potentially consistent with medical interventions rather than necessarily being indicative of inflicted trauma.

2. **Consistency with Resuscitation Attempts**: The fact that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby supports the initial attribution. Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes result in injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during these procedures.

3. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions (i.e., not smothering).

If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy being attributed to resuscitation attempts makes their presence plausible. This explanation aligns with the scenario where Andy's death was not due to Jane's actions but potentially due to natural causes or other factors, and the injuries were a result of medical interventions.

**Probability Judgment: 80**

This judgment reflects that if Jane is not guilty, it is quite likely that the injuries found in Andy could have occurred due to resuscitation attempts or other explanations not related to her guilt, making their presence plausible under the given circumstances.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted. This subsequent investigation found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. Such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby, although they can also be indicative of inflicted trauma.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The alternative explanation provided for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., it's considered after other causes of death have been ruled out), the presence of significant injuries (as found in both Andy and Ben upon further examination) complicates the SIDS explanation for both deaths.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries found in Andy could be due to other factors, such as accidental trauma or, as initially thought, resuscitation attempts. The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we're exploring the possibility that the injuries could be accidental or misinterpreted.

However, the presence of specific injuries like a torn frenulum and blood in the lung, alongside bruises, are not typical of SIDS. Moreover, attributing these injuries solely to resuscitation attempts may not be entirely accurate, as the nature and extent of the injuries can sometimes indicate a more complex scenario.

Given that the initial autopsy did not reveal these injuries and they were only identified after a more thorough examination post-Ben's autopsy, it raises questions about the visibility and interpretation of these injuries at the time of Andy's death.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries needs an alternative explanation. While resuscitation attempts can cause some injuries, the extent and nature of the injuries found might not be entirely consistent with typical resuscitation trauma.

Given the complexity and the fact that these injuries were not initially highlighted, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are due to resuscitation or other non-criminal causes is plausible but requires careful consideration of the medical evidence and expert testimony.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To determine the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. 

3. **Initial Attribution of Andy's Injuries**: The injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The context suggests that such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are operating under the assumption that the deaths were not due to smothering by her. The injuries found in Andy could then be considered in the context of either being a result of genuine resuscitation attempts or other accidental or natural causes not related to smothering.

The key information is that the injuries were initially put down to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty and the resuscitation attempts were genuine and properly performed, it is plausible that the injuries could be a result of these attempts.

The alternative explanation given is SIDS, but SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly explain the presence of specific injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung unless these are considered to be a result of resuscitation or other post-mortem handling.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the resuscitation attempts were genuine, the likelihood of Andy having such injuries (as a result of resuscitation attempts) is relatively plausible.

Given the context and assuming Jane's innocence, the probability that Andy's injuries are due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes is considered.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To determine the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's autopsy revealed severe injuries that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This reevaluation suggested that Andy had bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Injuries and Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. It is known that resuscitation efforts, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during CPR or other resuscitative measures.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS if Jane is not guilty. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of death have been ruled out.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted injury by her. In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being consistent with resuscitation attempts becomes a plausible explanation.

Given that Andy's initial death was thought to be due to natural causes (potentially SIDS), and considering that resuscitation attempts can cause the types of injuries found, it's reasonable to consider that these injuries could have occurred during attempts to revive him.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts or other non-inflicted causes is relatively high because there is an alternative, plausible explanation for these injuries.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted. This suggests that the initial assessment might not have looked deeply into potential signs of trauma or unnatural death.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are indicative of potential trauma.

3. **Attribution of Injuries to Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes result in injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during CPR. However, the nature and extent of injuries that can be attributed to resuscitation attempts can vary.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy could still be attributed to other causes, such as accidental trauma or, more relevantly, resuscitation attempts.

Given the context that the injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts and that such attempts can result in certain types of injuries, it is plausible that the injuries found in Andy could be a result of the medical interventions following his collapse.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries are a result of resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes is relatively higher.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The problem involves determining the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty of murdering him. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the initial attribution of Andy's injuries
The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. This is a crucial point because it implies that the injuries could be a result of medical intervention rather than intentional harm.

## Step 3: Analyze the possibility of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts
Given that resuscitation attempts can cause injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and internal injuries, it's plausible that Andy's injuries were a result of such attempts. The fact that these injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation efforts suggests that they are consistent with this explanation.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it means that she did not intentionally harm Andy. In this case, the injuries found in Andy could be attributed to the resuscitation attempts made to save him. The presence of such injuries does not necessarily imply guilt.

## Step 5: Consider the frequency and nature of SIDS and related injuries
SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is a condition where infants die suddenly and without explanation. While SIDS itself does not cause injuries, the attempts to resuscitate a baby believed to be suffering from SIDS could result in injuries similar to those found in Andy.

## Step 6: Assess the probability of the injuries given Jane's innocence
If Jane is innocent, the injuries could still be present due to the resuscitation attempts. The key is understanding that resuscitation can cause such injuries. Therefore, the presence of these injuries does not directly imply Jane's guilt.

## Step 7: Determine the likelihood based on the information given
The injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries occurred during attempts to revive Andy. The likelihood of such injuries, given that they were initially attributed to resuscitation, is relatively high if one considers that resuscitation attempts can indeed cause these injuries.

## Step 8: Provide a probability judgment
Given that the injuries could be a result of resuscitation attempts and that Jane's guilt is being questioned, we need to consider how likely these injuries are if Jane is innocent. The fact that the injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts supports the notion that they could occur without Jane being guilty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Explanation for Andy's Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found on Andy need to be explained by other means. The initial hypothesis was that these injuries could be due to resuscitation attempts. 

3. **Resuscitation Attempts as a Cause**: The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could potentially be attributed to resuscitation efforts, as they are consistent with the kind of trauma that can occur during vigorous attempts to revive a baby. 

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: The question then becomes how likely it is that these injuries were caused by resuscitation attempts. While resuscitation attempts can cause injuries, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum (which is often associated with non-accidental injury) might be less likely to be solely attributed to resuscitation. However, it's also documented in medical literature that resuscitation attempts can cause such injuries.

5. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation for Both Deaths**: If Jane is not guilty, SIDS is presented as an alternative explanation. However, the presence of injuries in both babies makes SIDS less likely as an explanation for both deaths, especially for Ben, given the significant autopsy findings.

6. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If we assume Jane is not guilty, then we have to consider that the injuries could be either due to resuscitation attempts or some other accidental means. The torn frenulum, bruises, and blood in the lung could be seen as potentially resulting from vigorous resuscitation, though some might argue these are more indicative of non-accidental trauma.

Given these considerations and focusing on the specific question regarding the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we have to weigh the plausibility that the injuries were due to resuscitation or other non-criminal causes.

The probability judgment is: 60 

**60**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the nature of the injuries.

The injuries found in Andy after further examination included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The question now is how likely these findings are if Jane is not guilty, implying that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could potentially be due to handling or accidental injury, but in the context of a baby who was thought to have died of natural causes, they might not have been initially expected. However, bruising can occur in various contexts, including accidental injury or even post-mortem handling.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with a significant force applied to the mouth, such as forced feeding or, in some interpretations, forced smothering. However, it can also occur accidentally.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with several causes, including resuscitation attempts. The act of resuscitating a baby can sometimes cause injuries due to the physical forces applied during the process.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death and the injuries found might not be due to her actions (such as smothering). The injuries could then be attributed to other causes, including the initial suspicion that they were due to resuscitation attempts.

Given that the initial autopsy suggested natural causes and that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries is related to how plausible it is that they resulted from resuscitation or other non-criminal causes.

SIDS does not typically present with specific injuries like those described, but the presence of such injuries doesn't necessarily negate a SIDS diagnosis if one considers that the injuries could be a result of post-mortem handling or misinterpretation of post-mortem changes.

The injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides a plausible alternative explanation if Jane is not guilty. 

The probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty (and thus, the injuries are due to other causes such as resuscitation) depends on the likelihood that such injuries can occur during resuscitation or are misinterpreted post-mortem changes.

**70**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed severe injuries that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are indicative of trauma.

3. **Initial Attribution of Injuries**: The injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The context provided indicates that such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries were not a result of her actions (e.g., smothering). If we are to consider the alternative explanation that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes, we need to evaluate the likelihood based on the information given.

- **Resuscitation Attempts**: The text suggests that injuries like those found in Andy can be consistent with resuscitation attempts. If Andy's injuries were indeed due to resuscitation efforts, and given that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), then the presence of such injuries could be seen as plausible under the circumstances of attempted resuscitation.

- **SIDS and Resuscitation Injuries**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes of death are ruled out. If Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, and the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts, this scenario aligns with Jane not being guilty.

To quantify the likelihood of Andy having such injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability that the injuries were a result of resuscitation or another non-criminal cause.

Given the context that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and there's an alternative explanation (SIDS or another natural cause) for the deaths, the likelihood of Andy having such injuries if Jane is not guilty hinges on the plausibility that these injuries resulted from medical interventions rather than inflicted trauma.

The probability judgment is: 60

This reflects a considered judgment based on the information provided, leaning towards the injuries being potentially related to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty, but also acknowledging that the presence of significant injuries still requires a plausible explanation. 

60
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the new information provided.

1. **New Information on Ben's Injuries**: It is stated that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death. This implies that spinal bleeding is not necessarily indicative of trauma or foul play but can occur naturally.

2. **Dislocated Ribs**: The dislocated ribs are suggested to have probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This indicates that the dislocated ribs might not be directly related to any actions by Jane but could be a result of medical intervention or the handling of the body after death.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not a result of her actions (e.g., smothering). The new information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs likely occurred either post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts. Both explanations are consistent with Ben's death being due to natural causes or SIDS, rather than due to Jane's actions.

- **Spinal Bleeding in Natural Death**: If spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths, then finding it in Ben is plausible if his death was due to natural causes.
- **Dislocated Ribs**: If the dislocated ribs were due to resuscitation attempts or occurred post-mortem, this is also plausible and not directly indicative of Jane's guilt.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is quite high because these findings can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's actions (natural death and resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling).

The probability judgment is: 80

This reflects a considered judgment that if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of Ben having spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs is relatively high due to the plausible explanations that are unrelated to her guilt.

80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the implications of Jane's innocence and the relevance of petechiae in the context of smothering.

1. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often considered one of the signs that can be associated with asphyxiation or smothering, as they can result from the increased pressure and resistance in the venous system during the struggle to breathe. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

2. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted trauma by her.

Given Jane's innocence, the absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering is quite likely because Ben's death would not be attributed to smothering. The absence of such injuries aligns with the scenario that Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS rather than smothering.

In cases where death is due to natural causes or SIDS, one would not expect to find the typical signs associated with asphyxiation or smothering, such as petechiae. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the absence of petechiae is consistent with this scenario.

The probability judgment is: 90

This reflects a high likelihood that if Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is expected because his death would not be attributed to smothering or asphyxiation.

90
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and implications of Jane's innocence.

1. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries or death of Ben through smothering or any other form of inflicted trauma.

2. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests either that the injuries were not present at that time or they were not immediately visible or significant enough to be noticed during the initial examination.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the injuries found post-mortem (such as dislocated ribs potentially occurring post-mortem or during resuscitation) could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital. This scenario is plausible and aligns with Jane's innocence.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, depends on whether these injuries can be attributed to post-mortem changes, handling, or resuscitation attempts.

Given that some of the injuries (like dislocated ribs) could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, it is plausible that they were not present or not noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital.

The probability judgment is: 80

This indicates a relatively high likelihood that if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Ben could have occurred after he was brought to the hospital, either due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes.

To assess the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the alternative explanation provided for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Spinal bleeding**: The information provided states that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. This implies that if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, spinal bleeding could be observed.

2. **Dislocated ribs**: It is mentioned that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the dislocated ribs could still be attributed to the resuscitation attempts made by medical personnel.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. 

- The spinal bleeding can be considered consistent with a natural death, as per the information given.
- The dislocated ribs can be attributed to resuscitation attempts, which is an intervention that occurred because Ben was found unwell, consistent with a scenario where his death was not due to Jane's actions but due to natural causes or SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben are plausible and can be explained by the circumstances surrounding his death and the medical interventions that followed.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
## Step 1: Understand the given scenario and the condition of Ben's autopsy findings.
The problem describes the autopsy findings of Ben, Jane and Frank's second son, which included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. It's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Assess the implications of the autopsy findings if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. Given this, we need to consider alternative explanations for their deaths, such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the autopsy findings in Ben under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, then Ben's death could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. The information provided states that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, which supports the possibility that Ben's death could be natural. Additionally, it's suggested that the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, which are not indicative of foul play.

## Step 4: Consider the probability of the autopsy findings given that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, the autopsy findings that are not directly related to smothering or foul play (such as spinal bleeding being common in natural death and dislocated ribs likely due to resuscitation or post-mortem) are more likely to be incidental or related to the circumstances of death or post-mortem handling.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood of these specific findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) occurring if Ben died of a natural cause like SIDS.
The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death makes it plausible under the assumption that Jane is not guilty. The dislocated ribs, attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling, are also plausible.

## Step 6: Determine the overall likelihood.
Given that the spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs can be explained by resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, these findings are relatively likely if Ben died of a natural cause.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood.
Since the spinal bleeding is stated to be common in natural death and the dislocated ribs have plausible alternative explanations (resuscitation or post-mortem), it is reasonable to conclude that these findings are likely if Jane is not guilty and Ben died of a natural cause.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Spinal bleeding**: It's stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death could be due to natural causes or SIDS. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of spinal bleeding would be consistent with a natural death, as per the given statement.

2. **Dislocated ribs**: The information provided indicates that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. In the scenario where Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the dislocated ribs resulted from resuscitation attempts made by medical personnel. The fact that an ambulance was called and attempts were made to resuscitate Ben supports this explanation.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben could be explained by natural causes (for the spinal bleeding) and resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes (for the dislocated ribs). 

Therefore, the likelihood of these findings, given Jane's innocence, is relatively high because they can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt.

The probability judgment is: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information.

The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death could be due to natural causes or SIDS.

The fact that the injuries were initially put down as due to resuscitation attempts and are consistent with such attempts provides a plausible explanation for their presence. Resuscitation attempts, especially on a baby, can sometimes result in injuries due to the fragility of infant tissues and the force applied during CPR or other revival efforts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries can be reasonably explained by the resuscitation attempts made.

The likelihood of these injuries, given Jane's innocence and the context of resuscitation attempts, is relatively high because they can be attributed to medical intervention rather than inflicted trauma.

The probability judgment is: 90
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context.

Petechiae are often associated with smothering or asphyxiation because they can result from the increased pressure and resistance in the veins during the struggle to breathe. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted trauma by Jane. In this case, the absence of petechiae (and other typical injuries associated with smothering) would be expected because there was no smothering.

The absence of such injuries in Ben is consistent with a death not caused by smothering, which aligns with the scenario where Jane is not guilty. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that Ben's death did not involve smothering, and thus, the absence of petechiae is expected.

The probability judgment is: 90
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's injuries were either not inflicted by her or were not a result of any action by her that would constitute a crime.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests several possibilities:
1. The injuries were not present at that time.
2. The injuries were present but not noticeable or not observed by the nurses.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the most plausible explanation for the injuries not being noted is that they were either not present or not observable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital. 

Given that some of the injuries (like dislocated ribs) could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, it's plausible that they were not present or not visible when Ben was first brought to the hospital.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The problem is asking us to assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty of murdering him. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the initial attribution of Andy's injuries
The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. This is a crucial piece of information because it provides an alternative explanation for the injuries.

## Step 3: Analyze the possibility of injuries being due to resuscitation
Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries such as bruising, rib fractures, and other internal injuries due to the vigorous nature of the attempts to revive them. The fact that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to this cause suggests that they could be consistent with medical intervention rather than intentional harm.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or accidental causes. The injuries found in Andy, if not due to smothering or other forms of abuse, could potentially be explained by resuscitation attempts or other accidental means.

## Step 5: Consider the probability of the injuries given Jane's innocence
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking at the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with an innocent explanation, such as resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial autopsy did not reveal these injuries and they were only found after further examination following Ben's autopsy suggests that they might not have been immediately apparent or considered significant at the time.

## Step 6: Assess the plausibility of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts
It is plausible that some level of injury could occur during resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, due to their fragile physiology. However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum can be particularly noteworthy as they are not typically associated with standard resuscitation practices.

## Step 7: Consider the context of SIDS and its implications
If Andy's death was due to SIDS, the injuries found could still be attributed to resuscitation attempts, as SIDS deaths often involve vigorous resuscitation efforts.

## Step 8: Make a judgment on the likelihood
Given that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that Jane is not guilty, it is reasonable to consider that the injuries might not be evidence of foul play but rather a consequence of medical intervention.

## Step 9: Quantify the likelihood
The exact probability depends on various factors including the nature of the injuries, the specifics of the resuscitation attempts, and the medical opinions on the likelihood of such injuries resulting from those attempts. However, without specific medical evidence or expert testimony, we must consider the general plausibility.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and possible causes of these injuries. The injuries in question include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur during resuscitation efforts, especially in infants, due to the fragility of their skin and the force applied during chest compressions or handling.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This is a common injury in infants that can result from a fall or, relevantly, from resuscitation efforts that involve forceful or improper handling of the baby's mouth or face.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be related to the attempt to resuscitate the infant. Aggressive or improper resuscitation techniques can cause internal injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, not due to smothering by Jane.

The injuries discovered in Andy were initially thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts. If we assume Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries could still be explained by the attempts to revive him.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be attributed to the resuscitation efforts, which would have been undertaken after Andy was found unresponsive.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of maltreatment by Jane. The findings in Ben's autopsy include spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs.

1. **Spinal bleeding**: It is stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding would be consistent with this scenario.

2. **Dislocated ribs**: The information provided suggests that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts were made on Ben, which supports this explanation.

Given that both findings have plausible explanations that are unrelated to any maltreatment (spinal bleeding being common in natural death and dislocated ribs likely due to resuscitation or post-mortem), if Jane is not guilty, it is quite plausible that these findings would still be present.

Therefore, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty is relatively high, as both can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt (natural death/SIDS and resuscitation attempts).

Probability judgment: 90
If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of maltreatment by Jane. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae (tiny red or purple spots on the skin), is consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxia or smothering, although their presence or absence is not definitive. If Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, it would be expected that typical signs of smothering, including petechiae, would be absent.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, the absence of petechiae and other typical injuries associated with smothering is likely.

Probability judgment: 95
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to any maltreatment or smothering by Jane. The injuries found on Ben, including the dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding, have been attributed to either resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes.

If the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts or occurred post-mortem, it is plausible that they were not present or not noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital. Resuscitation attempts would have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, and post-mortem changes could have developed after death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present or not noticeable when he was brought to the hospital, as they could be attributed to events that occurred after his arrival at the hospital (resuscitation attempts) or after death (post-mortem changes).

To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age. The exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. The presence of certain injuries or autopsy findings can rule out SIDS and suggest another cause of death, such as smothering.

Petechiae, which are tiny red or purple spots on the skin, can be associated with smothering or suffocation due to the increased pressure on the body, particularly around the face and neck, leading to rupture of small blood vessels.

The information provided indicates that despite the injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), there were no typical signs of smothering, such as petechiae.

If Jane is not guilty, and we assume that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, then the absence of petechiae in Ben would be expected because SIDS deaths typically do not present with such signs of asphyxiation or smothering.

The presence of injuries (like those found on Ben) is not typical for SIDS and could be indicative of another cause. However, the absence of petechiae is consistent with a death not caused by smothering.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Ben would not have injuries such as petechiae (since the cause of death was not smothering) is relatively high because the scenario (SIDS or another non-suffocation cause) does not typically include such signs.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the implications of Jane's innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by Jane. The alternative explanation given is that the deaths (of both Andy and Ben) could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural cause.

The information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is considered a common finding in natural death. This suggests that if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding is plausible and not unexpected.

Regarding the dislocated ribs, it is suggested that they probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts are a medical intervention that can sometimes cause injuries, including rib fractures or dislocations, especially in infants whose bones are more pliable and susceptible to injury.

If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, then it is reasonable to expect that certain autopsy findings could be consistent with this scenario. The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural deaths supports this. Additionally, the dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts (which are a common response to an infant found unresponsive) or occurring post-mortem provides a plausible explanation that is consistent with a natural death scenario.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben are relatively likely because they can be explained by factors other than smothering or intentional harm.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and implications.

If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that Ben's death was likely due to a natural cause, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), rather than smothering or another form of intentional harm.

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, could be indicative of a traumatic event or an agonal process (the process of dying).

If these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital, it could imply that they either developed post-mortem or were not easily observable at the time of admission.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses could be interpreted in a few ways:

1. The injuries might have been subtle or not immediately apparent.
2. They could have occurred after admission to the hospital, possibly during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause, it is plausible that the injuries were not present or not observable when Ben was brought to the hospital. For instance, if the injuries occurred during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem, they would not have been present initially.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is relatively likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present or not observable when he was brought to the hospital, given that they could be attributed to factors occurring after the initial presentation.

Probability judgment: 70
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death, like Ben's, was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm by Jane. The initial autopsy suggesting natural causes of death for Andy supports this scenario.

The injuries found on Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones.

If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, it is plausible that the injuries found on Andy could be attributed to the resuscitation attempts made to save him. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of injuries that can be explained by resuscitation attempts is relatively likely, as it provides a plausible explanation for their occurrence.

To address this question, we need to analyze the given information and understand the implications of the absence of certain injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in the context of Ben's death.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both Andy and Ben would be attributed to another cause, in this case, potentially SIDS, despite the injuries found during their autopsies.

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. Smothering, on the other hand, involves obstructing the airflow to the mouth and nose, potentially causing asphyxia.

2. **Injuries found on Ben and Andy**: Ben had injuries including damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Andy's further examination revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are not typical for SIDS and are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause of death.

3. **Absence of Petechiae in Ben**: Petechiae are small spots on the skin that can result from asphyxia or other causes. While they can be associated with smothering, their absence does not necessarily rule out smothering. The presence or absence of petechiae can be influenced by various factors, including the method and duration of smothering.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we're operating under the hypothesis that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. The presence of significant injuries in both children is unusual for SIDS.

The absence of petechiae in Ben, if we were to assume his death was due to smothering (contrary to our hypothesis that Jane is not guilty), doesn't directly relate to the likelihood of SIDS. However, if Ben's death was due to SIDS, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically involve the kind of asphyxial signs like petechiae that can be seen in smothering.

Therefore, under the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty and assuming the deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with this hypothesis because SIDS wouldn't typically cause such signs.

**Thus, given Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben is relatively high because it aligns with the expectation for SIDS or a similar cause.**

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, complicates the attribution of their deaths to SIDS, as SIDS is typically diagnosed when no other cause of death is found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben is being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty. Petechiae are often associated with smothering or asphyxia due to the increased venous pressure causing rupture of small blood vessels. However, their absence does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the presence and visibility of petechiae can vary.

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the expectation would be that there are no signs of smothering, including petechiae. Thus, in this context, the absence of petechiae would be expected.

However, the critical issue here is that the autopsy findings for both Andy and Ben revealed injuries that are not typical for SIDS, making their deaths unusual and not straightforwardly attributable to SIDS.

Given that we are assessing the scenario where Jane is not guilty, and thus looking at the likelihood of the absence of petechiae under the assumption that the cause of death was not smothering, the absence of petechiae would be expected if the cause was SIDS or another natural cause.

Therefore, under the condition that Jane is not guilty and assuming the deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the absence of petechiae in Ben is plausible and expected.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, such as smothering. In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means.

The information provided suggests that the injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation, especially in infants, can sometimes result in iatrogenic injuries due to the procedures used to try to revive them. These can include bruising, fractures (like rib fractures), and other internal injuries.

Given that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that resuscitation efforts can indeed cause such injuries, it is plausible that the injuries found in Andy were a result of the attempts to revive him.

If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was not due to her actions but rather to a natural cause or SIDS (despite the presence of injuries), the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts becomes more plausible as an explanation.

Therefore, under the condition that Jane is not guilty, the presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts makes it more likely that these injuries were indeed due to such attempts.

Probability judgment: 70
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. The injuries found on Ben include those to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest that they either occurred after Ben's arrival at the hospital or were not immediately apparent.

However, certain injuries, especially those that are significant such as to the ribs and spinal cord, are typically not something that would be easily overlooked by medical professionals, especially in the context of an emergency admission.

If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not caused by her, it is still possible that the injuries occurred before Ben was brought to the hospital but were not immediately visible or noted. However, it is less likely that significant injuries would not be noticed during medical examination upon admission.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is lower because it would imply that the injuries occurred in the hospital, which is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding causing the injuries.

However, the statement primarily addresses the observation of the injuries by the nurses. If the injuries were internal or not immediately visible, they might not have been noted upon initial examination.

The scenario suggests that the injuries could have been present but not immediately apparent or documented. If they were not noted, it doesn't necessarily mean they weren't present; it could mean they weren't visible or diagnosed at that time.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death and injuries were not a result of her actions. The information provided suggests alternative explanations for the findings: that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death makes it plausible if Ben's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS.

The dislocated ribs being attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation that is not related to Jane's actions.

Given these alternative explanations, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes more plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be found in Ben due to natural causes or circumstances unrelated to Jane's guilt.

Therefore, under the condition that Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs becomes more likely as they can be explained by natural causes or other factors unrelated to Jane's actions.

To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the given information.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of smothering her two sons, Andy and Ben. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings on both children, which suggested injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.

2. **Autopsy Findings on Ben**: Ben's autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, it did not reveal typical signs associated with smothering, such as petechiae.

3. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often cited as a potential indicator of smothering or asphyxiation because they can result from the increased venous pressure during a struggle to breathe against an obstruction. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.

4. **Jane's Innocence and the Likelihood of the Absence of Petechiae**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to another cause, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. The absence of petechiae in Ben's autopsy is being considered in this context.

5. **Assessing the Absence of Petechiae**: The presence or absence of petechiae can vary widely among cases of asphyxiation or smothering. Not all cases of smothering result in petechiae. If Jane is innocent and Ben's death was not due to smothering, then the absence of petechiae is expected because there was no smothering to cause them.

6. **Likelihood**: Given that petechiae are associated with smothering or asphyxiation, if Jane is not guilty (and thus Ben was not smothered), it is reasonable to expect that Ben would not have petechiae as a result of smothering. Therefore, the absence of petechiae is consistent with the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was not due to smothering.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and thus Ben was not smothered by her, the absence of petechiae is likely because the condition (smothering) that could potentially cause them was not present.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context of the case and the information provided about the deaths of Andy and Ben, as well as the characteristics of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and smothering.

First, let's clarify that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is SIDS, a diagnosis often considered when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained.

Smothering, or asphyxiation by obstruction of the nose and mouth, can result in certain autopsy findings, including petechiae, which are tiny hemorrhages in the skin or mucous membranes due to the increased pressure from attempting to breathe against an obstruction. However, the presence and extent of such findings can vary.

The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy does not necessarily rule out smothering, as these signs are not universally present in all cases of smothering. However, it does make it less likely if one is considering smothering as the cause of death.

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS, then the absence of petechiae or other signs of smothering would be expected because SIDS is, by definition, an unexplained death that occurs in otherwise healthy infants, typically during sleep. SIDS does not have specific autopsy findings associated with it; the diagnosis is one of exclusion after other causes of death have been ruled out.

The injuries found on Ben (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical of SIDS and suggest trauma. Similarly, the re-examination of Andy's autopsy findings revealing bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung also suggests that the death might not be due to SIDS but to some form of inflicted injury.

However, the question is asking us to consider the scenario where Jane is not guilty. In such a case, if we were to hypothesize that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not involve the mechanical obstruction of breathing that can cause petechiae.

Given the complex presentation of the case and the fact that the injuries found on both children are not typical for SIDS, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty (and assuming the deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause) hinges on whether the actual cause of death aligns with the absence of such signs.

To directly address the question: If Jane is not guilty and the implication is that the deaths were not due to smothering but perhaps to SIDS or another cause, the absence of petechiae is plausible because SIDS or other natural causes would not typically result in such findings.

Therefore, considering the context and focusing on the absence of petechiae as a factor, we must evaluate the likelihood based on the understanding that SIDS or a similar condition does not cause such injuries.

The probability judgment is: **80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the given information and the context of the case.

First, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy is noted. Petechiae are often considered indicative of asphyxiation or smothering due to the rupture of small blood vessels caused by increased venous pressure during the struggle to breathe against an obstruction.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering or any form of intentional asphyxiation by her. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS, by definition, is a sudden and unexplained death in infancy. It is diagnosed after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy, and the exclusion of other causes of death. The presence of injuries such as those found in Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and subsequently in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) complicates the diagnosis of SIDS, as these are not typical findings in SIDS cases.

However, the question focuses on the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it means Ben's death was not due to smothering. The absence of petechiae would be expected in cases where death was not due to smothering or asphyxiation because petechiae are associated with such mechanisms of death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to another cause (potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause), the absence of petechiae is consistent with this scenario.

Given this context, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because it aligns with the expectation that there would be no signs of smothering or asphyxiation.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The explanation that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts is plausible because such actions, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and the force applied during CPR.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to any intentional act by her, such as smothering. The injuries found in Andy could then be more likely attributed to other causes, including the resuscitation attempts or other accidental means.

Given that the injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, and assuming Jane is not guilty, it becomes more plausible that the injuries were indeed a result of such attempts or other non-intentional causes.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being attributed to resuscitation or other accidental means is relatively high.

Probability judgment: 70
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and context.

The information provided states that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. 

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to any intentional act by her, such as smothering. In this scenario, the explanation for the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being consistent with natural death or resuscitation attempts/post-mortem changes becomes more plausible.

The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death directly supports the notion that if Jane is not guilty (and thus Ben's death was natural or accidental but not due to her actions), the presence of spinal bleeding is consistent with this scenario.

Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, this explanation is also consistent with Jane not being guilty, as it suggests that the injuries could have occurred during medical intervention or after death, rather than being a result of any intentional act by Jane.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben, under the given explanations, is relatively high because these findings can be attributed to natural causes or circumstances unrelated to Jane's guilt.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to any intentional act by her. The injuries found on Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests one of two main possibilities: either the injuries were not present or noticeable at that time, or they were present but not detected.

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to natural causes or an accident not related to her actions, it is plausible that the injuries could have developed or become apparent after Ben was brought to the hospital. For example, hypoxic damage could progress after the initial presentation, and some injuries might not be immediately visible.

However, if the injuries were significant and related to a traumatic event, it is less likely that they would not have been noticed by medical staff upon initial examination, unless they were not immediately apparent or were internal.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming that the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present or noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on the nature of the injuries and the timing of their occurrence.

If the injuries could have developed post-mortem or were not immediately apparent, it is more plausible that they were not noted by nurses initially.

To determine the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we first need to understand the context and the given information. Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, but notably, it did not show petechiae, which are sometimes associated with smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, one of which is suggested to be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life.

The absence of petechiae in Ben's autopsy, despite other injuries being present, can be interpreted in two main contexts: 

1. **If Jane is guilty and smothered Ben:** The presence or absence of petechiae can be relevant. Petechiae are sometimes found in cases of smothering due to the pressure applied to the face or asphyxia. However, their absence does not rule out smothering since not all smothering cases result in petechiae.

2. **If Jane is not guilty:** In this scenario, if we consider the possibility that Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS deaths do not typically have specific findings like petechiae associated with them. The presence of other injuries (like rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage, and hemorrhages) in Ben's autopsy complicates this interpretation because these are not typical of SIDS.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we're examining the likelihood of not finding petechiae in a scenario where Ben's death is not due to smothering by Jane. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the absence of petechiae is expected because SIDS does not cause such specific signs of asphyxia or smothering.

However, the other injuries found on Ben are not typical for SIDS, making the scenario more complex. The injuries suggest a possible non-natural cause, but the question specifically asks us to consider the scenario where Jane is not guilty, implying we are looking at alternative explanations.

The presence of significant injuries to Ben not typical of SIDS complicates the assessment. However, if we are to consider that Jane is not guilty and thus look for an alternative explanation, we still have to acknowledge that the autopsy findings on Ben are not typical of SIDS.

The likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty and if we were considering a natural death like SIDS is relatively high simply because SIDS or natural deaths wouldn't typically cause petechiae. However, the injuries found suggest a more complex situation.

Given the complex nature of this case and focusing strictly on the absence of petechiae as the criterion, we must consider what this means in the context of a non-smothering death. The probability that there are no petechiae in a death not caused by smothering (and potentially due to SIDS or another cause) is relatively high because petechiae are more directly associated with asphyxial deaths.

**85**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we first need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of smothering her two sons, Andy and Ben. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be associated with smothering or other forms of trauma (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). However, typical signs associated with smothering, like petechiae, were not found.

2. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are small spots on the skin that occur due to bleeding from small capillaries. They can be a sign of smothering or asphyxiation because they result from the increased pressure and resistance in the venous system during a struggle to breathe against an obstruction. However, the absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the presence and visibility of petechiae can depend on various factors, including the method and force used in smothering and the time elapsed before the body is examined.

3. **Jane's Innocence and SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the deaths could be due to another cause, potentially SIDS. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The presence of significant injuries in Ben (and retrospectively found in Andy) complicates attributing their deaths to SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when no other cause of death is found after thorough investigation.

4. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae**: If Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to smothering by her), the absence of petechiae in Ben is expected because there was no smothering to cause them. Therefore, the absence of petechiae is consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane.

Given the information and understanding that petechiae are associated with but not exclusive to smothering or asphyxiation, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to another cause (like SIDS or another natural or accidental cause), it is plausible that Ben would not have petechiae.

Therefore, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because it aligns with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of certain injuries, such as those found in Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), and upon further investigation in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), strongly suggests that their deaths were not typical SIDS cases. Smothering can cause asphyxia, leading to various injuries including those found in Ben.

2. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often associated with asphyxial deaths, including smothering, because they result from the increased pressure on the veins due to attempts to breathe against an obstruction. However, the absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering, as their presence and visibility can vary depending on several factors, including the manner of death, the force applied, and individual physiological responses.

3. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death was not smothering by her. If we consider the alternative that both deaths were due to SIDS, then the absence of petechiae is expected because SIDS deaths are not typically associated with such signs of asphyxia unless there are other complicating factors or an alternative cause of death.

However, the presence of significant injuries in both Andy and Ben complicates the picture, suggesting that their deaths might not be straightforward SIDS cases. The scenario given leans towards a non-SIDS cause of death for both infants.

Given that the question asks us to assume Jane is not guilty, and thus potentially considering SIDS or another natural cause for the deaths, the absence of petechiae would be more likely because SIDS or natural causes are not typically associated with the signs of asphyxia like petechiae.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and we are considering the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in the context of deaths not due to smothering by Jane, the absence of such injuries is quite plausible, especially if the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause.

However, given that the autopsy findings on Ben included signs that could be indicative of asphyxia or trauma, the scenario complicates a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must first understand the context and the medical findings associated with smothering and SIDS.

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - **Smothering** is a form of asphyxia caused by obstruction of the external air passages. Typical findings in smothering deaths can include petechiae (on the skin, eyes, and sometimes internal organs), signs of struggle or resistance, and other signs of asphyxia.
   - **SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)** refers to the sudden, unexplained death of an infant less than one year of age that doesn't have a known cause after a complete investigation, including an autopsy. SIDS is not typically associated with specific injuries like petechiae or bruising unless there's an underlying condition or other cause.

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**:
   - Ben's autopsy showed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are indicative of significant trauma or asphyxiation but are not exclusively diagnostic of smothering.
   - The absence of petechiae, which are sometimes seen in asphyxial deaths, is noted.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any form of intentional act by her. In such a case, the likely explanation could be SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.
   - SIDS does not typically present with the injuries found in Ben. However, if we consider that the deaths could be due to a natural or unexplained cause (like SIDS), the presence of significant injuries in Ben (and potentially Andy upon re-examination) complicates this diagnosis.
   
4. **Probability of Absence of Petechiae**:
   - If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause (and Jane is not guilty), we would not expect to see the significant traumatic injuries that were found. 
   - The absence of petechiae might be expected in a SIDS death, as SIDS is not typically characterized by such findings.
   - However, the presence of other significant injuries (like those to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages) in Ben does not align with a typical SIDS diagnosis.

Given the information and the condition that Jane is not guilty, we're essentially being asked to evaluate the likelihood of not observing petechiae in a scenario that doesn't align with smothering or homicide. 

Petechiae are not a universal finding in asphyxial deaths, and their presence or absence can vary widely. If Ben's death was not due to smothering, we'd be looking at an alternative cause. In the context of SIDS or another natural/accidental cause not involving smothering or significant asphyxia, not finding petechiae would be expected.

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and considering an alternative explanation like SIDS (despite the presence of other injuries complicating this diagnosis), the absence of petechiae would be considered likely because SIDS deaths typically do not present with such asphyxial signs.

**80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The injuries found on Ben, such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of significant trauma. However, the absence of petechiae, which are often associated with smothering or asphyxiation due to the rupture of small blood vessels, is noted.

Petechiae are not universally present in cases of smothering or asphyxia. Their presence or absence can depend on various factors, including the mechanism of asphyxia, the force applied, and the individual's response. The absence of petechiae does not rule out asphyxia or smothering entirely.

If Jane is not guilty, and we consider SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths, the presence of significant injuries on Ben (and retrospectively found on Andy) complicates this diagnosis because SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of explanation after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

However, the key question revolves around the likelihood of not finding typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) if Jane is not guilty. Given that the absence of petechiae is being considered in the context of Ben's death, and assuming Jane's innocence implies that the cause of death might not be smothering, we are essentially assessing the likelihood of not observing petechiae in a scenario where smothering is not the cause of death.

Since petechiae are associated with asphyxial deaths, including smothering, not finding them in a case where smothering is not the cause (under the assumption of Jane's innocence) is plausible. The presence or absence of petechiae is just one aspect of forensic pathology findings. Other causes of death or natural conditions might not result in petechiae.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and we are considering alternative explanations like SIDS or other natural causes for the deaths (despite the presence of some traumatic injuries complicating this), the absence of petechiae is not unusual because the underlying cause is not smothering or asphyxia due to Jane's actions.

Given the information and focusing on the specific question, the absence of petechiae in a scenario where smothering is not the cause of death (Jane is not guilty) can be considered relatively likely, as petechiae are associated with specific types of asphyxial deaths.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the implications of Jane's innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that she did not inflict the injuries on Ben. The injuries found on Ben, such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, indicate significant trauma.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply several things:

1. The injuries might have been subtle or not immediately apparent upon initial examination.
2. The injuries could have occurred or become more apparent after Ben's arrival at the hospital, although this is less likely given the nature of the injuries described.
3. The medical staff might not have conducted a thorough examination for such injuries at the time of admission.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on when and how these injuries could have occurred.

Given that the scenario of Jane's innocence suggests that she did not cause the injuries, and if we are to believe that the injuries were not present at the hospital (to align with her innocence and potentially point towards another cause or timing), we need to consider the plausibility of the injuries not being immediately evident or having occurred post-mortem or very shortly before death.

However, some of the injuries described, such as haemorrhages, are typically associated with a traumatic event occurring before death. The fact that they were not noted by nurses could suggest they were not immediately obvious or were missed.

If Jane is not guilty and did not cause the injuries, and if the injuries were significant enough to be found during an autopsy, it is less likely that they occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, as it would be challenging for such significant injuries to occur in a hospital setting without being noticed.

Therefore, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, hinges on the possibility that they were not immediately apparent or were subtle.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the implications of Jane's innocence.

The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This implies that these findings can be explained by causes other than Jane's actions, potentially aligning with a natural death or an accidental/iatrogenic cause.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the death or the injuries to Ben through smothering or any other means. The presence of spinal bleeding, being common in natural deaths, and dislocated ribs, potentially due to resuscitation or post-mortem changes, supports the notion that these findings could be consistent with an alternative explanation for Ben's death other than smothering by Jane.

For instance, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the spinal bleeding could be a coincidental or related finding. The dislocated ribs, if attributed to resuscitation attempts, would be a plausible consequence of medical intervention rather than an action by Jane.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is relatively high because these can be explained by other factors.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given context and the explanation provided for Andy's injuries.

The information states that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause Andy's death or inflict the injuries.

The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, could be consistent with resuscitation attempts or other accidental/iatrogenic causes if Jane is not guilty.

If the injuries are indeed due to resuscitation attempts, as initially thought, then their presence is plausible even if Jane is not guilty, because medical intervention can sometimes result in such injuries.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be attributed to the medical attempts to revive him, which is a plausible and innocent explanation.

To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Spinal bleeding in natural death**: It's mentioned that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death. This implies that if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with such a cause.

2. **Dislocated ribs post-mortem or due to resuscitation**: The information provided suggests that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts are a common response to an infant found unwell or not breathing, and they can sometimes cause injuries.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to another cause, such as SIDS.

- The presence of spinal bleeding being common in natural death supports the notion that if Ben died of a natural cause (like SIDS), spinal bleeding could be found.
- The dislocated ribs being attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts is plausible and not necessarily indicative of foul play.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming both deaths were due to natural causes (SIDS), the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is relatively high because:
- Spinal bleeding is consistent with natural death.
- Dislocated ribs can occur due to resuscitation attempts, which are common in cases where infants are found unwell.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

1. **Spinal bleeding**: It's mentioned that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death could be due to natural causes or SIDS. The fact that spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths suggests that its presence is not necessarily indicative of foul play.

2. **Dislocated ribs**: The information provided indicates that the dislocated ribs "probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts." Resuscitation attempts are a plausible explanation for the dislocated ribs, as they can cause injuries due to the force applied during the procedure. If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to a cause other than smothering by Jane (such as SIDS or another natural cause), then the occurrence of dislocated ribs during resuscitation attempts is a reasonable expectation.

Given these points, if Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane. 

- The spinal bleeding is consistent with a natural death or SIDS, so its presence is plausible.
- The dislocated ribs are likely due to resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible scenario regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence regarding the cause of death.

Therefore, the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben are not necessarily inconsistent with Jane being not guilty. The presence of these findings can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt (natural death or resuscitation attempts).

**85**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the problem
The problem is about assessing the likelihood of certain autopsy findings in the case of Ben, Jane's second son, given that Jane is not guilty of murdering him. The autopsy findings in question are spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs.

## Step 2: Consider the given information about the autopsy findings
The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. It's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 3: Analyze the implications of Jane being not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted injury by Jane. Therefore, their deaths could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the autopsy findings if Jane is not guilty
Given that Jane is not guilty, the deaths of the children are likely due to natural causes or accidents not related to Jane's actions. The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death supports the possibility that Ben's death could be due to natural causes. The dislocated ribs, attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts, also aligns with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to Jane's intentional act.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability based on the information given
Since the spinal bleeding is stated to be a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs are likely due to post-mortem or resuscitation-related factors, these findings are plausible in the context of a natural death or SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is reasonable to expect that such findings could still occur.

## Step 6: Consider the frequency of SIDS and its implications
SIDS is given as having a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. While this is relatively rare, the presence of certain autopsy findings does not necessarily preclude SIDS or other natural causes, especially if some findings can be explained by post-mortem changes or medical interventions.

## Step 7: Conclude on the likelihood of the autopsy findings
Given that the spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or during resuscitation, these findings are not necessarily indicative of foul play. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that Ben could still have had these autopsy findings.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood
The information suggests that the autopsy findings in Ben (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) can be explained by natural causes or circumstances unrelated to Jane's guilt. Thus, the likelihood of these findings given Jane's innocence is relatively high because they can be attributed to other factors.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To address the question, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the prosecution suggesting that she smothered them. The alternative explanation considered is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy for Ben revealed injuries including spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, along with other signs. The new information indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane.

4. **Analyzing the Specific Findings for Ben**: 
   - **Spinal Bleeding**: It's stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding would be expected or at least not unusual.
   - **Dislocated Ribs**: The information suggests that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts were made on Ben, as the couple called an ambulance and he was attempted to be resuscitated. Thus, dislocated ribs could be a consequence of these efforts, which is consistent with a scenario where Jane is not guilty and was actually trying to save Ben.

5. **Combining the Information**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause (like SIDS), the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are plausible and can be explained by natural causes or the circumstances surrounding the attempts to save Ben.

Given the information and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high because these findings can be attributed to either natural causes or the medical interventions that were undertaken.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions (e.g., smothering) but could be attributed to another cause such as SIDS.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Interpretation of Findings if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - The injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts, according to the initial assessment. Resuscitation attempts were indeed made on Andy, as Jane called an ambulance after finding him unconscious.
   - If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of injuries that can be explained by resuscitation attempts is plausible.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**:
   - The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can be attributed to the medical interventions (resuscitation attempts) made to try to save Andy. 
   - The fact that these injuries can be explained by resuscitation attempts supports the notion that if Jane is not guilty and was actually trying to save Andy, the presence of these injuries is consistent with her actions.

5. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be explained by the resuscitation attempts made on him.

Probability judgment: 85
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions (e.g., smothering) but could be attributed to another cause such as SIDS.

2. **Injuries Found on Ben and Initial Observation**: The injuries (including spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital.

3. **Interpretation of Findings if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death is attributed to a natural cause. The injuries found during the autopsy, such as spinal bleeding, are considered common in natural deaths, and dislocated ribs are likely due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes.
   - The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon initial examination is plausible if the injuries are of a nature that is not immediately visible or if they occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**:
   - The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural deaths and not necessarily something that would be noted during an initial examination by nurses supports the likelihood that such an injury might not have been noted.
   - The dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes also supports the notion that these injuries could have occurred or become apparent after the initial examination.

5. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, it's plausible that the injuries were either not present or not noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital, especially if they are attributed to natural causes or occurred during resuscitation/post-mortem.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions (e.g., smothering) but could be attributed to another cause such as SIDS.

2. **Absence of Petechiae**: Petechiae are often considered an indicator of asphyxiation or smothering. The absence of petechiae in Ben's case is noted.

3. **Interpretation of Findings if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, it is expected that there would be an absence of injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae.
   - SIDS deaths are characterized by a lack of clear cause and often a lack of significant pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxiation.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**:
   - The absence of petechiae and other typical signs of smothering is consistent with Ben's death being due to a natural cause rather than smothering.
   - Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that there would be an absence of such injuries.

5. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is high because his death would be attributed to a natural cause, not smothering.

To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we first need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. Smothering, on the other hand, involves obstructing the airflow, leading to asphyxiation. The presence of certain injuries like petechiae can sometimes be associated with smothering due to the increased pressure on the veins, causing them to rupture.

2. **Injuries Found on Ben**: Ben's autopsy revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are not typical for SIDS and are more indicative of a traumatic cause.

3. **Absence of Petechiae**: Petechiae are small spots that occur due to bleeding from small blood vessels. They are sometimes seen in cases of smothering or asphyxiation. However, their presence is not a definitive indicator of smothering, and their absence does not rule out smothering.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by her. The alternative explanation given is SIDS.

However, the injuries found on Ben (and subsequently on Andy upon re-examination) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is characterized by a lack of significant findings on autopsy. The presence of significant injuries in both children makes SIDS a less likely explanation for their deaths.

The question, though, is about the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or another natural/accidental cause, the absence of petechiae would be expected because petechiae are more associated with asphyxial deaths or smothering. 

Given that Ben's death is more likely to be attributed to a traumatic or unnatural cause rather than SIDS due to the presence of significant injuries, and if we assume Jane is not guilty (implying an alternative, possibly accidental or natural cause), the absence of petechiae might not be directly relevant or surprising because the cause of death is still under investigation and not clearly linked to smothering.

However, if we strictly consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, implying the deaths might not be due to smothering or intentional harm, the absence of petechiae is plausible and expected under a SIDS or non-smothering scenario.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and if we consider an alternative explanation like SIDS or another accidental cause not involving smothering, the absence of petechiae is likely.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the cause of death for both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS, as suggested as an alternative explanation.

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. Smothering, on the other hand, involves obstructing the airflow to the mouth and nose, which can cause asphyxiation.

2. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often cited as a potential sign of smothering or asphyxiation due to the increased venous pressure causing rupture of small blood vessels. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive evidence of smothering. Their absence doesn't necessarily rule out smothering, nor does their presence confirm it, as they can be found in other conditions as well.

3. **Assessing the Scenario if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm caused by her. In this case, if we consider SIDS as a potential cause, the injuries found on Ben (and retrospectively on Andy) need to be reconciled with a non-homicidal explanation.

4. **Injuries Found on Ben and Andy**: The presence of significant injuries (e.g., to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, and bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy) suggests a traumatic cause rather than SIDS alone. SIDS typically does not present with such significant traumatic injuries.

5. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the expectation would be that there are no signs of traumatic asphyxia or smothering, including petechiae. The absence of petechiae would be consistent with a non-traumatic cause of death.

However, the original autopsy findings on Ben and the re-examination findings on Andy suggest significant trauma, which complicates a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. 

Given the presence of significant injuries that are not typical of SIDS, and assuming Jane is not guilty (thus, the deaths are not due to smothering or other forms of intentional harm), we need to reconcile the traumatic findings with a non-intentional cause.

**The key question is how likely is it to not find petechiae if the cause of death was not smothering (as per the not guilty assumption).**

If we assume the deaths were not due to smothering, the absence of petechiae would be expected in the context of SIDS or other non-traumatic causes. However, the described injuries complicate this interpretation.

Therefore, in the context of Jane not being guilty and assuming a non-traumatic cause of death (like SIDS), the absence of petechiae is plausible because SIDS or other natural causes wouldn't necessarily involve signs associated with asphyxiation or smothering.

The probability of not finding petechiae in Ben, given Jane is not guilty, should be considered in the context that petechiae are not a universal finding in smothering and their absence is compatible with a non-suspicious cause of death.

**80**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

First, let's understand the condition and the implications of the injuries found. Ben's autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings led to further investigation into Andy's death, which also uncovered signs of potential non-accidental injury.

The absence of petechiae, which are often associated with smothering due to the rupture of small blood vessels caused by increased pressure, is noted. Petechiae are commonly seen in cases of asphyxiation or smothering, but their absence does not necessarily rule out such causes.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm inflicted by her. In this scenario, we are left to consider alternative explanations for their deaths.

One possible alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it's known that there are various risk factors associated with it.

The presence of injuries in both Andy and Ben, as discovered during their autopsies, complicates the attribution of their deaths to SIDS, as SIDS is typically associated with a lack of significant findings at autopsy that would explain the cause of death. However, it's worth noting that the presence of certain findings does not necessarily preclude the possibility of SIDS, although it might suggest other causes or contributing factors.

The question of the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty involves understanding the nature of SIDS and the pathological findings associated with it. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with petechiae as a defining characteristic; rather, petechiae are more commonly linked to asphyxial deaths.

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be consistent with SIDS, as SIDS deaths are not typically characterized by such specific signs of asphyxiation. However, the presence of other injuries complicates this interpretation.

Given the scenario and focusing on the absence of petechiae, if we are considering an alternative to smothering (i.e., Jane not being guilty), and if we were to entertain the idea that the deaths could be due to a cause not involving intentional smothering, the absence of petechiae would be relatively likely because SIDS or other natural causes would not typically present with these signs.

Therefore, considering the context and the given that Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is relatively plausible because it aligns with the expectation for SIDS or other non-asphyxial causes.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not intentionally cause the injuries or death of Ben. In this scenario, the explanation for Ben's death and injuries could be related to other factors, potentially accidental or natural.

The question revolves around whether the injuries found on Ben were present at the time he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries upon his arrival suggests either that the injuries were not present or were not readily observable at that time.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming that the injuries were not inflicted by her, there are a few possibilities regarding the timing of when the injuries occurred:
1. The injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital.
2. The injuries were present but not observable or not observed by the nurses.

If we consider the first possibility (injuries occurring after being brought to the hospital), it's highly unlikely unless there was some form of mishandling or an event within the hospital that caused the injuries, which is not suggested by the information provided.

The second possibility (injuries being present but not observed) is also plausible because some injuries, especially internal ones or those not immediately visible, might not be detected during an initial examination by nurses.

However, the injuries described (to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are significant and would typically be expected to be identified or suspected during a medical examination, especially if it included a thorough assessment.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, it is still possible that the injuries were present but not noted. However, given the severity of the injuries, it is somewhat counterintuitive that they were not observed.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty, hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-admission or being missed during the initial examination.

20
To assess the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred either post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This context is crucial because it provides alternative explanations for the observed injuries that are not related to Jane's guilt.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her intentional actions, such as smothering. In this scenario, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs can be explained by the given alternative causes.

Spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death makes it plausible in the context of Ben's death if it was due to natural causes. Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, this provides a plausible explanation for their presence that is unrelated to Jane's actions.

Given these explanations, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to natural causes or circumstances not related to her actions, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs becomes more understandable and expected under the given circumstances.

Therefore, the likelihood of finding these conditions in Ben, given that Jane is not guilty and considering the alternative explanations provided, is relatively high.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. It is given that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not intentionally cause harm to Andy.

If the injuries found in Andy are attributed to resuscitation attempts, this provides a plausible explanation for their presence that is unrelated to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding intentional harm.

Given that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, and assuming that resuscitation was attempted on Andy, the presence of these injuries becomes more understandable and expected.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and considering that the injuries could be due to resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of finding these injuries in Andy is relatively high because they can be explained by the medical interventions that were undertaken.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries. 

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. Given that Andy was subjected to resuscitation efforts after being found unresponsive, it's plausible that the injuries could have resulted from these attempts.

4. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: The scenario also presents SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. However, the presence of injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) in Andy's autopsy photographs, even if initially attributed to resuscitation, complicates the SIDS explanation.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). For Andy, if we are considering that his death was not due to smothering or any action by Jane, then the injuries found could be attributed to other causes.

- **Resuscitation Attempts as a Cause**: The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be a result of resuscitation efforts. This is a plausible explanation if we are to consider that Jane is not guilty.

Given the information that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, and assuming Jane is not guilty (meaning she did not smother Andy), the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were a result of resuscitation attempts is relatively high.

Therefore, considering Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts (and not due to her actions) is considered.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy results were known that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Injuries Consistent with Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. Such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby, although the nature and extent can vary.

3. **Nature of the Injuries**: 
   - **Bruises to Arms and Legs**: These could be due to handling during resuscitation or other accidental means, though in the context of suspected smothering, they raise concern.
   - **Torn Frenulum**: This is often associated with a significant impact to the mouth or face, or forced feeding/bottle feeding. It can also be caused by medical procedures, though it's less common.
   - **Blood in the Lung**: This could be indicative of trauma or could be related to resuscitation efforts.

4. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). In this scenario, the injuries could potentially be explained by other factors including resuscitation attempts or other accidental means.

Given that the initial cause of death for Andy was thought to be natural and that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries could be a result of vigorous resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions rather than intentional harm.

However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum and bruising does raise concerns and is not typical for SIDS or standard resuscitation attempts. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't typically present with such injuries.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of the specific injuries found (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being coincidental or due to medical intervention is lower than if they were directly related to smothering. However, the exact probability depends on various factors including the specifics of the resuscitation attempts and the medical opinions on the likelihood of such injuries occurring during those attempts.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and his injuries were thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts. The injuries included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Resuscitation Attempts and Injuries**: It's known that resuscitation attempts, especially on infants, can sometimes cause injuries. These can range from bruising due to chest compressions to more severe internal injuries.

3. **SIDS and Resuscitation**: If Andy's death was due to SIDS, and not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm, then the injuries found could still be attributed to the resuscitation efforts made by medical personnel trying to save him.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was likely due to SIDS or some other natural cause rather than smothering. The injuries found on Andy could then be attributed to the attempts to revive him. The fact that such injuries can occur during resuscitation attempts supports the plausibility that they were a result of medical intervention rather than intentional harm by Jane.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be a result of resuscitation attempts. The presence of such injuries is consistent with this explanation, as they are known to occur during attempts to revive infants.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and information provided.

1. **Injuries Found on Ben**: The injuries included damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are severe and indicate significant trauma or force.

2. **Nurses' Observations**: The nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital. This suggests that either the injuries were not present or were not observable at that time.

3. **Implication of Jane Not Being Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions, potentially supporting the possibility that his death and injuries could be attributed to other causes or that the injuries occurred post-mortem or were not immediately apparent.

4. **Post-Mortem Changes and Autopsy Timing**: The visibility of certain injuries, especially internal ones like damage to the ribs and spinal cord, might not be immediately apparent upon initial examination. Autopsy findings can reveal injuries that were not visible externally or were not detected during initial medical examination.

5. **Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it's plausible that the severe injuries found during the autopsy could have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately visible. However, the nature of the injuries (e.g., damage to ribs and spinal cord) suggests significant force, which is not typically associated with SIDS or natural post-mortem changes.

Given these considerations, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether these injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately detectable. While some post-mortem changes or injuries might not be immediately visible, the described injuries suggest significant trauma.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often associated with asphyxiation or smothering due to the increased pressure and resistance in the venous system, causing tiny blood vessels to rupture.

2. **Absence of Petechiae**: The absence of petechiae in Ben's case, despite other significant injuries, is a relevant observation. If Ben's death was due to smothering, one might expect to see petechiae as part of the typical presentation.

3. **Implication of Jane Not Being Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions, potentially supporting the possibility that his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

4. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was not due to smothering, then the absence of petechiae is expected because they are typically associated with asphyxial deaths. The presence or absence of petechiae can be influenced by various factors including the mechanism of death and individual response.

5. **SIDS and Petechiae**: SIDS deaths are not typically associated with petechiae as they are not usually related to asphyxiation caused by external obstruction.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the absence of petechiae is likely because SIDS or other natural causes would not typically result in the presence of petechiae.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and context.

1. **Spinal Bleeding and Natural Death**: The statement that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death suggests that if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with this.

2. **Dislocated Ribs and Resuscitation or Post-Mortem Changes**: The suggestion that dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation for this finding that is not directly related to Jane's actions.

3. **Implication of Jane Not Being Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions. This supports the possibility that his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.

4. **Likelihood of Findings if Jane is Not Guilty**: Given that spinal bleeding can be associated with natural death and dislocated ribs could be due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, the presence of these findings in Ben is plausible if Jane is not guilty.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is likely because these findings can be explained by natural death or other non-criminal factors.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, potentially aligning with the alternative explanation provided, such as SIDS or another natural cause.

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of significant trauma. The fact that these were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests a few possibilities:

1. The injuries could have been subtle or not immediately apparent, potentially missed during the initial examination.
2. The injuries could have occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.

If Jane is not guilty, the assumption might be that the trauma did not occur at her hands. Therefore, the injuries would have had to occur either before she called for medical help (but were not visible or diagnosed at the hospital upon arrival) or after Ben was admitted.

However, medical professionals, especially in emergency settings, are trained to identify and document signs of trauma or distress in infants. It's less likely that significant injuries such as those described would be completely missed upon initial examination unless they were not apparent at the time or were internal injuries that didn't manifest externally.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on whether it's plausible that medical staff missed these injuries upon initial examination or that they occurred post-admission.

Given that the injuries were significant and related to internal trauma (some of which might not be immediately visible externally), it's still possible that they were not immediately noted by nurses, especially if the initial focus was on resuscitation efforts.

However, without more specific information on the nature of the medical examination and the condition of Ben upon arrival, we're left to reason based on the information given.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital would depend on the plausibility of them occurring post-admission or being missed.

The injuries described are severe and indicative of significant force or trauma. It is generally unlikely that such extensive internal injuries would occur in a hospital setting without being noticed or documented, especially in the context of an infant being treated for a life-threatening condition.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and we're considering the injuries not being present upon hospital admission, we must weigh the plausibility of these injuries occurring post-admission or being undetected.

Probability judgment: 20
Given the new information, if Jane is not guilty, it suggests that the deaths of her children might be attributed to natural causes or other factors not related to her actions.

The revelation that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation for the injuries found on Ben that is not related to Jane's guilt.

Spinal bleeding being common in natural deaths directly supports the notion that Ben's condition could be due to natural causes rather than inflicted trauma. Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, this further supports the idea that the significant injuries found on Ben might not be indicative of inflicted trauma during life.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben becomes more plausible and aligns with the new information provided. The spinal bleeding could be a result of natural causes, and the dislocated ribs could be a consequence of medical intervention or post-mortem changes.

This new information significantly changes the interpretation of the injuries found on Ben, making it more likely that they could be explained by factors other than Jane's guilt.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any action by Jane. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, supports this scenario because it suggests that the death might not have been caused by asphyxiation or smothering.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxiation or strangulation, although their presence or absence is not definitive. If Ben's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS, or another cause not related to smothering, it would be expected that injuries typical of smothering, like petechiae, might be absent.

The absence of such injuries in Ben, given that Jane is not guilty, aligns with the expectation that his death was not due to smothering. Therefore, it's likely that injuries such as petechiae would be absent if Ben's death was due to natural causes or other non-traumatic reasons.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions, and potentially aligns with the explanation that his death was due to natural causes or SIDS.

The information provided that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby, supports the plausibility that Andy's injuries could have occurred during medical intervention.

If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, it is still possible for injuries to be found on Andy if they are related to the resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial assessment attributed Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation for their presence that is not related to Jane's guilt.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is still relatively high because they can be explained by the resuscitation attempts. This explanation aligns with the scenario where Jane is not responsible for Andy's injuries.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these injuries.

1. **Initial Assessment and Resuscitation Attempts**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, can be consistent with aggressive or improper resuscitation attempts. 

2. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The question posits SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical of SIDS and suggest some form of trauma or intervention.

3. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries were either due to other causes or misinterpreted. 
   - **Resuscitation Attempts**: Many of the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation efforts, which can sometimes be vigorous or improperly performed.
   - **Accidental Injury**: Though less likely, there's a possibility of accidental injury, though the nature of the injuries (like a torn frenulum) might suggest a non-accidental origin to some experts.

4. **Probability Consideration**: The critical piece of information is that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The fact that further investigation found injuries that could be indicative of non-accidental trauma doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility that they were still related to resuscitation or another non-criminal cause if Jane is not guilty.

However, given the nature of the injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung), they are less likely to be solely the result of proper medical procedures or SIDS. Still, if we are to consider Jane's innocence, we must weigh the likelihood of these injuries being due to other, non-criminal causes.

Given the context that Andy's injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts and considering that some of these injuries could plausibly result from such efforts, the likelihood of these injuries occurring if Jane is not guilty could be considered more plausible if we accept that resuscitation attempts can result in such injuries.

To quantify this with a probability judgment requires synthesizing the information:

The injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation. However, the injuries discovered are not typical for SIDS and raise suspicions.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the given information.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and his injuries were thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts. The injuries found later (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were only reevaluated after Ben's autopsy revealed suspicious injuries.

2. **Resuscitation Attempts and Injuries**: It's mentioned that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. Resuscitation attempts, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and bones. The force applied during CPR or other resuscitative measures can occasionally result in bruising, rib fractures, or other internal injuries.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The alternative explanation provided for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of injuries in both Andy and Ben makes SIDS a less likely explanation for their deaths if those injuries are deemed to be non-accidental or not fully explained by resuscitation attempts.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries of both children were not due to her actions. In this scenario, for Andy, the injuries could potentially be attributed to the resuscitation attempts or other accidental means. The fact that initial autopsy attributed his death to natural causes and the injuries to resuscitation attempts supports this.

Given the information that the injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts and considering that the initial assessment did not raise suspicions of foul play, it is plausible that Andy's injuries were a result of such attempts if Jane is not guilty.

The probability judgment for the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty would be relatively high because the injuries could be explained by resuscitation efforts.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we first need to understand the context and the injuries described. Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts but were later found to include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could potentially occur during resuscitation attempts, especially if they were vigorous. However, the presence of bruises might also suggest some form of trauma.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the upper gums) is often associated with a significant impact to the mouth or face. While it's possible for this to occur during resuscitation, it's not a typical or expected outcome of standard resuscitation procedures.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, trauma, or asphyxiation. It could also potentially be related to resuscitation efforts, though it's not a common or expected outcome of properly performed CPR.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. 

The injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If we consider that Jane is not guilty, it suggests that the injuries could be a result of genuine attempts to resuscitate Andy or could be misinterpreted.

Given the information and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely these injuries are under the circumstances of resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes. 

If the injuries were due to resuscitation, they might not necessarily be expected but could be considered possible if the resuscitation was vigorous or improperly performed. However, some of the injuries, like a torn frenulum, are not typical of standard resuscitation procedures.

To assign a probability to these injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to weigh the likelihood that they occurred either as a result of genuine resuscitation efforts or as part of the circumstances surrounding Andy's death that were not related to Jane's actions.

The probability judgment regarding the occurrence of these injuries under the assumption that Jane is not guilty involves considering the plausibility of these injuries being a result of other factors (like resuscitation) rather than an act of smothering or other forms of abuse.

Given the injuries described and assuming Jane is not guilty, the injuries could still be considered relatively unlikely but possible if we attribute them to vigorous or improper resuscitation attempts or to the circumstances of Andy's death. However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum complicates this interpretation.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the case and the injuries found in Andy and Ben.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the prosecution suggesting that she smothered them. The autopsy of Ben revealed significant injuries, and subsequent re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs showed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Recognize that the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.
The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially thought to be due to the attempts to revive him.

## Step 3: Consider the alternative explanation for Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. The injuries found in Andy would then need to be explained by other factors, such as the resuscitation attempts.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts.
Given that the initial autopsy suggested natural causes and the injuries were attributed to resuscitation, we need to consider how plausible it is that these injuries resulted from attempts to revive Andy.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability based on the given information.
The key information is that Andy's injuries were initially put down as due to resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. If Jane is not guilty, the question becomes how likely it is that the observed injuries in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts rather than intentional harm.

## Step 6: Consider the frequency and context of injuries during resuscitation attempts.
Injuries during resuscitation, especially in infants, can occur but are not universally present. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation efforts.

## Step 7: Make a judgment on the likelihood of the injuries given Jane's innocence.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths might be due to natural causes or accidents. The likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts becomes a critical factor. While resuscitation can cause some injuries, the presence of specific injuries like a torn frenulum and blood in the lung might be less common but still possible.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood based on the available information.
Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation and without specific data on the frequency of such injuries during resuscitation attempts on infants, we must consider the plausibility based on general knowledge. Resuscitation attempts can result in various injuries, but the specific combination and severity can vary.

## Step 9: Provide a final probability judgment.
To determine the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty, we should consider that resuscitation attempts can indeed cause injuries. However, the exact probability depends on the specifics of the resuscitation efforts and the infant's condition.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the explanations provided for his injuries. 

Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These types of injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby, as the process of resuscitation, especially if vigorous or improperly performed, can result in certain injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering them). In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy could more plausibly be attributed to other causes, such as the resuscitation attempts or other accidental means.

However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum is often scrutinized closely in infant deaths because it can be indicative of non-accidental injury. A torn frenulum typically occurs when there is a significant force applied to the mouth, such as forcibly feeding or, in some contexts, smothering. Nevertheless, it's also possible for such injuries to occur during vigorous resuscitation attempts.

Given the initial attribution of Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts, if we assume Jane is not guilty (and thus, not responsible for the injuries), it's plausible that the injuries could have occurred during the attempts to revive Andy.

To quantify the likelihood of these injuries under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability that the injuries were either due to resuscitation or another accidental cause.

The exact probability is difficult to quantify without specific statistical data on the frequency of such injuries during resuscitation attempts. However, given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation, it suggests that there is a plausible explanation for them that is not related to Jane's guilt.

Therefore, considering the information provided and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is reasonably possible due to other causes like resuscitation attempts.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the medical handling of Ben.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben through smothering or other forms of non-accidental injury. In this scenario, the injuries found on Ben could have occurred either before he was brought to the hospital or during his time in the hospital.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could be due to several factors, including the subtlety of the injuries, the focus of the medical staff on resuscitation efforts, or the possibility that the injuries occurred after admission.

However, if Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not caused by her, it is still possible that they could have occurred before Ben's hospital admission, potentially due to other causes or accidents. The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on the timing and nature of the injuries.

Given that Ben was pronounced dead after being brought to the hospital, and considering the types of injuries found (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it's plausible that these injuries could have been sustained before hospital admission.

However, the fact that the nurses did not note these injuries upon admission does not necessarily mean they were not present; it could also mean that they were not immediately apparent or were not looked for in the initial assessment.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, the injuries could have occurred before hospital admission. The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being low because it is more plausible that they were present but not noted or that they were a result of events prior to hospitalization.

20
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the relevance of petechiae in deaths due to smothering.

Petechiae are often considered a sign that may be associated with asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence is not exclusive to these causes. However, the absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering or asphyxiation, as not all cases of smothering result in petechiae.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or other forms of non-accidental injury caused by her. In this scenario, Ben's death could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

The absence of petechiae in Ben's case, given that he is assumed not to have been smothered by Jane, is consistent with the hypothesis that his death was not due to smothering. However, it's also possible for a smothering death not to present with petechiae.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and thus Ben's death was not due to smothering by her, the absence of petechiae is consistent with this scenario. Moreover, even if we were considering smothering, the absence of petechiae is not unusual because not all smothering cases present with this sign.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae is relatively high, simply because the scenario of smothering (which might or might not include petechiae) is not applicable.

80
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given explanations for these findings.

The spinal bleeding is stated to be a common finding in natural death, which implies that it could occur without any foul play or non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, it means Ben's death was not due to smothering or other non-accidental injury caused by her.

The dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts, especially if vigorous, can cause rib injuries. Post-mortem changes or handling during autopsy could also potentially cause or contribute to such findings.

Given these explanations, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be found in Ben due to natural causes or as a result of medical interventions (resuscitation attempts).

The likelihood of finding these conditions is therefore relatively high under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, as they can be explained by factors other than non-accidental injury.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, and one possible explanation is that they died of SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical characteristics of SIDS. 

If Jane is not guilty, it means Ben's injuries were not inflicted by her. However, the presence of these injuries still needs to be explained. If we assume that Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not caused by her, then it is still possible that the injuries occurred before Ben was brought to the hospital.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could be due to several factors, such as the nurses not conducting a thorough examination for such injuries or the injuries not being immediately apparent. 

However, if we are to assess the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for the injuries.

Given that the injuries found on Ben are severe and not typical of SIDS, and assuming Jane did not cause them (since we're considering the scenario where Jane is not guilty), the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on whether there's another plausible explanation for how and when the injuries occurred.

One possible interpretation is that if Jane is not guilty, the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not noticed by the hospital staff due to the circumstances or quality of the examination.

However, given the severity of the injuries (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain), it is unlikely that they were not present or not detectable upon a reasonable medical examination.

The probability judgment hinges on understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for the observed injuries. The injuries' presence and the fact that they were not noted by hospital staff suggest either they were not there or not detected.

To directly assess the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty requires evaluating the plausibility of alternative causes or explanations for the absence of notation by hospital staff.

Given the information and focusing on the task:

The final probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane's second son, Ben, was found unwell, and despite attempts to resuscitate him, he was pronounced dead. An autopsy later revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Considering Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. 

3. **Assessing the injuries and their detection**: The injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. If Jane is innocent, there are a few possibilities for when the injuries occurred:
   - They could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital.
   - They might have been missed by the nurses due to their nature or severity.

4. **Analyzing the likelihood**: 
   - The injuries discovered (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are significant and not typical of normal medical examination or resuscitation efforts. It's unlikely that such severe injuries would be entirely missed by medical professionals unless they were not immediately apparent or were internal.
   - If Jane is not guilty, the injuries must have occurred either before she called for medical help or after Ben was in the hospital's care.

5. **Evaluating the hospital scenario**: Medical professionals, including nurses, are trained to observe and document injuries or signs of trauma. While it's possible for minor injuries to be overlooked, significant injuries such as those described are less likely to be missed, especially in the context of a resuscitation effort where the infant is thoroughly examined.

6. **Probability Judgment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they would have had to occur either during transport or after arrival at the hospital. While medical handling can sometimes cause minor injuries, the extensive nature of Ben's injuries (e.g., rib and spinal cord injuries) makes it less plausible they were caused by hospital staff during resuscitation efforts, though it's not entirely impossible.

However, without direct evidence of when the injuries occurred, we must consider the plausibility based on the information given.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-admission or being missed by medical staff.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to analyze the information provided and the implications of Jane's innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. The scenario then suggests that the injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, or they were missed by the nurses, or there is an alternative explanation for both deaths that does not involve Jane's guilt.

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of significant trauma. For these injuries not to have been noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital, one of several scenarios could have occurred:
1. The injuries were not present or were not observable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital.
2. The injuries were present but were missed by the nurses.

Let's examine the plausibility of these scenarios:

1. **The injuries were not present or not observable**: If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not inflicted by her, they must have occurred after she handed Ben over to the medical professionals. This is plausible if we consider that the injuries could have been inflicted during medical procedures or were not immediately apparent.

2. **The injuries were present but missed by the nurses**: Medical professionals, including nurses, are trained to observe and document injuries or signs of trauma. However, it's not impossible for minor or certain types of injuries to be overlooked, especially in emergency situations where the focus is on saving a life.

However, the nature of the injuries described (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) suggests significant trauma that would likely be noticed during a medical examination, especially in the context of an infant being resuscitated.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, we need to consider the likelihood that these significant injuries were either not present or not observed when Ben was brought to the hospital.

If we are to assume Jane's innocence and that the injuries were not caused by her, and given the severity of the injuries found on Ben, it is somewhat plausible that the injuries were either not present (having occurred post-admission) or were not immediately observable (perhaps due to their nature or the circumstances of the medical emergency).

However, the scenario that these significant injuries were not noted by nurses is less likely because medical staff are trained to observe such signs, especially in critical situations.

The probability that the injuries were not present or noted is influenced by the assumption of Jane's innocence and the context that the injuries are severe and significant.

The likelihood is not extremely high because medical professionals are trained to identify such signs. However, there is a possibility that they could have been missed or occurred post-admission.

**50**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the nature of the injuries.

The injuries found on Ben included damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and severe injuries that are not typical of a natural death or SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). In this case, one possible explanation is that both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause.

The question focuses on the likelihood that the injuries on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, it would be contradictory to have such severe injuries attributed to a natural cause or SIDS, as SIDS by definition is unexplained and not typically associated with such injuries.

However, the fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest a few possibilities:
1. The injuries were not present at the time of hospitalization.
2. The injuries were present but not detected or documented by the nurses.

If Jane is not guilty, and we're considering alternative explanations for Ben's death and injuries, the scenario that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital becomes more plausible because it suggests that the injuries might have occurred post-mortem or were not related to Jane's actions.

However, given the nature of the injuries (e.g., damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it's medically controversial to suggest they occurred post-mortem without a plausible explanation for such injuries.

The critical point is that if Jane is not guilty, the most straightforward interpretation is that Ben's death and injuries are not attributed to her. The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being plausible if we consider the possibility that they could have been missed by the nurses or occurred post-mortem. However, the latter is less likely given the nature of the injuries.

Considering these factors, the probability judgment should reflect the likelihood based on the assumption of Jane's innocence and the nature of the evidence.

The injuries being undetected or not present could happen, but given the severity of the injuries to Ben, it's less likely they were entirely missed by medical professionals if they were present at the time of hospitalization.

**60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Given Condition**: We are to assume Jane is not guilty. This implies that the deaths and injuries to the children are not a result of her actions.

3. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The injuries found on Ben were not observed by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. 

4. **Analyzing the Situation**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the injuries and deaths of the children would be attributed to other factors, such as SIDS or another accidental or natural cause.

5. **Considering SIDS and the Injuries**: SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS typically does not involve the kind of injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, etc.). The presence of such injuries suggests that if Jane is not guilty, there must be another explanation for these injuries.

6. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, for the injuries on Ben not to have been present when he was brought to the hospital, they would have had to occur after he was admitted. This would imply that someone or something else caused these injuries after hospitalization.

7. **Hospital Setting**: Hospitals have strict protocols and supervision, making it less likely for such significant injuries to occur unnoticed. However, it's not impossible, as medical settings are not completely infallible.

8. **Probability Judgment**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether it's plausible that the injuries occurred post-admission. While hospitals are closely monitored environments, errors or unnoticed events can occur. However, given the severity of Ben's injuries, it's highly unlikely they occurred in a hospital setting without being noticed by medical staff.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, it is still quite unlikely that the significant injuries found on Ben occurred in the hospital without being noticed. Therefore, the likelihood that these injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital leans towards being low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during the autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the Injuries and the Circumstances**: The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of the children could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or another unexplained or natural cause.

3. **Evaluating the Statement**: The statement that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital is critical. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations. However, the absence of noted injuries upon initial examination does not necessarily mean the injuries were not present; it could mean they were not visible or not detectable at the time.

4. **Considering the Possibility**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her or anyone else in a manner related to the alleged murder, there are a few possibilities:
    - The injuries could have been missed by the nurses if they were not immediately visible or were internal.
    - The injuries might not have been caused by the event leading to death if the death was not due to smothering or similar trauma.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane is not guilty, hinges on the assumption that the injuries are related to the cause of death or handling post-mortem. If the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, it's plausible that the injuries were either not related to the cause of death or occurred post-mortem.

However, the specific injuries described (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain) are not typically associated with SIDS. If Jane is not guilty and the injuries are not a result of her actions, we must consider alternative explanations, such as the injuries occurring post-mortem or being unrelated to the cause of death.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood because the described injuries are significant and unlikely to be completely missed by medical professionals unless they were not visible externally or were internal injuries that didn't manifest immediately. However, given the serious nature of the injuries and the context that they were discovered during an autopsy, it's less likely they were entirely absent at the time of hospital admission if they were directly related to the cause of death. The probability judgment is not 0 because it's possible that some injuries could have been internal or not immediately apparent.
To evaluate the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, showed injuries during the autopsy, including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids. These findings led to further investigation into the death of the first son, Andy.

2. **Assumption that Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by Jane.

3. **Considering alternative explanations for the injuries**: If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Ben need to be explained by other factors. The injuries discovered during Ben's autopsy are indicative of significant trauma, which could have occurred either before or after the hospital visit.

4. **Analyzing the possibility that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, there are a few scenarios to consider:
   - The injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital. This could involve accidental injury during medical handling or other unforeseen circumstances.
   - The injuries might have been missed by the nurses due to their nature or severity not being immediately apparent.

However, medical professionals are trained to handle infants with care, and significant injuries like those described would be unusual to occur during standard medical handling without being noticed. Moreover, the presence of specific injuries like rib fractures and spinal cord damage would typically be investigated and potentially identified during a hospital examination, especially if there were symptoms or signs that should have prompted a closer examination.

5. **Likelihood assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, for the injuries to not have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, one would have to assume that the injuries occurred post-hospital admission. Given the professional handling and care provided in a hospital setting, it's less likely that such significant injuries would occur unnoticed or be caused accidentally by medical staff.

However, it's also possible that the injuries were present but not detected by the nurses due to various reasons like lack of thorough examination for such injuries or the subtlety of the signs at the time.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on whether one believes the injuries could have plausibly occurred post-admission or were simply not detected.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider several factors and the context provided.

1. **Nature of the Injuries**: The injuries described for Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and severe injuries.

2. **Jane's Guilt or Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. The alternative explanation given is SIDS, but the presence of severe injuries makes SIDS an unlikely explanation for Ben's death since SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

3. **Observation by Nurses**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations.

4. **Possible Explanations for the Injuries Not Being Noted**:
    - **Injuries Not Present or Not Visible**: It's possible that the injuries were either not present or not visible during the initial examination at the hospital. Some injuries, especially internal ones like certain types of spinal cord injuries or internal hemorrhages, may not be immediately apparent without specific diagnostic tests.
    - **Quality of Initial Examination**: The thoroughness of the initial examination by nurses is also a factor. While nurses are trained to look for visible signs of injury or distress, the presence of certain types of injuries might not always be immediately detectable without more detailed medical imaging or autopsy.

5. **Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, the injuries must have occurred either before she discovered Ben was unwell or after she called the ambulance. The latter is highly unlikely as it would imply that someone else caused the injuries after Jane called for medical help, which is not suggested by the scenario provided.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we have to consider the likelihood that the injuries occurred either very shortly before Ben was found unwell or that they were not detectable at the time of the hospital examination.

Given that the scenario implies Jane's innocence and that she discovered Ben was unwell and called an ambulance, the injuries would have had to occur either before this discovery or be undetected by the nurses. 

The probability that the injuries were not present or detectable when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, hinges on whether one believes the injuries could have been caused by someone or something else before Jane's discovery or if they were simply not visible during the initial examination.

The fact that specific, severe injuries were found during the autopsy but not noted by nurses suggests either they were not visible or occurred after hospital admission, which is unlikely given the context.

The probability judgment is: 20. 

**20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, let's analyze the given information and the scenario:

1. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben (and Andy). The deaths and injuries could then be attributed to other causes or explanations, such as SIDS or other accidental or natural causes.

2. **Injuries Found on Ben**: The injuries include damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries.

3. **Nurses Not Noting Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. There are a few possible explanations for this:
   - The injuries were not present or not visible at the time Ben was brought to the hospital.
   - The injuries were present but not detected by the nurses.

Let's examine the likelihood of the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty.

If Jane is not guilty, it means we are looking for alternative explanations for Ben's injuries and death. The prosecution's case relies heavily on the presence of these injuries as evidence of smothering or some form of abuse. If Jane is innocent, one would expect that:
- The injuries could have occurred post-mortem or after Ben was brought to the hospital.
- The injuries might not be related to Jane's actions.

However, the types of injuries described (e.g., hypoxic damage to the brain, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) suggest that they were likely related to the cause of death or the circumstances surrounding it, rather than occurring post-mortem or being unrelated to the death.

The fact that nurses did not note these injuries could suggest that they were not visible or were not present at the time of admission. However, significant injuries like those described would likely be detected during a thorough examination, especially in the context of an infant being resuscitated and examined after being brought to the hospital.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not a result of her actions, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital could depend on whether there's an alternative plausible explanation for both the injuries and the nurses not noting them.

However, given the severe nature of the injuries and the context that they were discovered during an autopsy, it's reasonable to infer that these injuries were likely present and related to the cause of death.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **The condition of Ben when brought to the hospital**: The question states that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

3. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). An alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

4. **Analyzing the injuries**: The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma. If Jane is not guilty, these injuries would need to have occurred post-mortem or been missed by the medical staff. 

5. **Considering the possibility of the injuries not being present or noted at the hospital**: 
    - If the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they must have occurred post-mortem. 
    - The nature of the injuries (e.g., to the ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) suggests significant force or trauma, which is not typically associated with SIDS.

6. **Evaluating the likelihood**:
    - The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon Ben's arrival at the hospital is crucial. If Jane is not guilty, one has to assess the plausibility that these significant injuries were either not present or were not detectable at the time of hospital admission.

Given the specifics of the case and the injuries described, if Jane is not guilty, it raises questions about when and how Ben sustained these injuries. For the injuries to not have been present or noted, they would have had to occur after hospital admission but before the autopsy, or they were simply not detected by the hospital staff.

The injuries described are significant and would likely be expected to be detected upon a thorough medical examination, unless they were very subtle or occurred post-mortem very shortly before the autopsy.

However, it's worth noting that medical professionals are trained to identify such injuries, and it's unusual for significant injuries to be entirely missed.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the injuries were not present or detectable when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, primarily because significant injuries as described would typically be expected to be noticed or have some clinical correlation that would be documented by healthcare professionals. However, the exact timing and nature of these injuries could affect this assessment.
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few key pieces of information and logical deductions based on the given context.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy that suggested possible smothering or violent treatment.

2. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The injuries found on Ben were not observed by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. This suggests one of two main possibilities: either the injuries were not present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, or they were present but not observable or noticed by the nurses.

3. **Implication of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. The alternative explanation given for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although the presence of injuries on Ben (and later discovered on Andy as well) complicates this explanation.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: 
    - If Jane is not guilty, we're left to consider how the injuries could have occurred without her involvement. 
    - The injuries not being noted by nurses could be due to several factors, such as the nature of the injuries (e.g., internal injuries that aren't immediately visible) or the nurses not conducting a thorough examination for such injuries at the time.

5. **Analyzing the Possibility**: 
    - For the injuries to not have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they must have occurred after his hospital admission. 
    - If Jane is not guilty, then anyone else who could have had access to Ben (e.g., hospital staff, other family members) would be considered. However, the scenario focuses on Jane's guilt or innocence, suggesting that the implication is that if she didn't cause the injuries, they might not be related to her actions.

6. **Likelihood Judgment**: 
    - Given that Ben was in a hospital setting when he died, it's generally expected that he would be under close observation, making it less likely for new significant injuries to occur unnoticed. 
    - However, medical environments are not perfect, and mistakes or unforeseen events can occur.

7. **Conclusion**: The key question revolves around the likelihood that the injuries were not present upon hospital admission if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is innocent, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, one might consider the possibility that the injuries occurred post-admission. However, hospital settings have protocols and observations in place that make significant unnoticed injuries less likely.

The probability that the injuries were not present is relatively low because hospitals have monitoring and care that typically would detect significant injuries or changes in condition. However, it's not impossible that some injuries could be missed or occur after admission.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the given scenario and the condition that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children, and their deaths could be attributed to other causes such as SIDS or other natural/accidental reasons.

## Step 2: Analyze the information provided about Ben's condition and the injuries found.
Ben was found to have injuries including damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids after his death. However, these injuries were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

## Step 3: Consider the implications of the injuries not being noted by nurses.
The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not present or not visible at that time, or they were missed by the medical staff.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or could have been missed during the initial examination at the hospital. The presence of such significant injuries (to the ribs, spinal cord, brain, and eyes) post-mortem suggests a severe traumatic event. However, the question is about the likelihood that these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.

## Step 5: Assess the probability based on the given condition.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an alternative explanation for the deaths and the injuries. The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma. If these injuries were not noted by the nurses, it raises questions about when they occurred. If Jane is innocent, one possible scenario is that the injuries were not present or visible when Ben was alive or when he was brought to the hospital.

## Step 6: Consider the nature of the injuries and the likelihood they could have been missed or occurred post-mortem.
The injuries described are severe and would likely have been evident or at least suspected during a medical examination, especially if they were present before death. However, some injuries could potentially be internal or not immediately visible.

## Step 7: Relate the injuries to the possibility of them not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital.
If the injuries were severe enough to be detected post-mortem, it's plausible they could have been present but not immediately obvious or diagnosed at the hospital, especially if they were internal. However, the fact that they were not noted suggests they might not have been visible or were not looked for.

## Step 8: Consider the probability.
The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were simply not detected.

## Step 9: Final assessment of the likelihood.
Given the severe nature of the injuries, if they were not noted by the nurses, it's possible they either occurred post-mortem or were not visible/detected at the time. The likelihood that they were not present is related to the plausibility of post-mortem injury or the failure to detect them.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. The injuries found on Ben, including those to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are significant and would likely have been noticed by medical professionals if they were present when Ben was brought to the hospital. 

Given that the nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital, there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that the injuries were not present at that time and occurred subsequently, perhaps during resuscitation efforts or handling by hospital staff, although the latter is less likely given the nature of the injuries. Another possibility is that the injuries were present but not noticed by the nurses.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, hinges on the plausibility of the injuries being caused after Ben's arrival at the hospital versus the possibility that they were missed by the nurses. 

In medical settings, significant injuries such as those described are typically noticeable during initial assessment and treatment. However, it's also possible that in the context of emergency resuscitation efforts, some injuries might not be immediately apparent or documented.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not caused by her, it's still uncertain whether the injuries occurred before or after Ben's arrival at the hospital. However, the fact that such significant injuries were not noted by nurses suggests either they were not present or were not immediately obvious.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, involves considering the likelihood of these injuries being caused post-arrival versus being missed by medical staff. 

The injuries described are serious and typically associated with significant trauma or abuse. If they were present and not noted, it would imply a significant oversight by medical staff. On the other hand, if they occurred after arrival, it could be due to various factors including the handling during resuscitation attempts.

Given these considerations and the information provided, assessing the exact probability is challenging without more specific details about the medical handling and examination of Ben post-arrival. However, it's reasonable to deduce that if Jane is not guilty and did not cause the injuries, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards a plausible scenario, given the context that significant injuries should be noticed by medical professionals.

**65**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries to the infants could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other accidental or natural causes.

The injuries found on Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries that would likely be apparent or suspected upon a thorough medical examination.

If Jane is not guilty, then the assumption is that she did not cause these injuries. In that case, the injuries could have occurred due to other reasons or could have been misinterpreted.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could be due to several reasons:
1. The injuries might not have been visible or apparent at the time of admission. Some injuries, especially internal ones, might not be immediately visible without a thorough autopsy or specific diagnostic tests.
2. The medical staff might not have conducted a thorough examination for such injuries at the time of admission, focusing instead on immediate care and resuscitation efforts.
3. The injuries could have occurred post-mortem or during the resuscitation efforts, although this is more controversial and depends on the nature of the injuries.

However, if we are to assume Jane's innocence and consider alternative explanations for the deaths and the injuries, it's crucial to evaluate the likelihood based on the given information and medical understanding.

Given that the question is about the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, and assuming Jane is not guilty, we're essentially assessing the plausibility of the injuries not being detected or not being present at the time of hospital admission.

The injuries described are significant and would likely be detected during a thorough examination. However, the fact that they were not noted by nurses suggests either they were not apparent or not looked for.

Therefore, considering Jane's innocence, one plausible interpretation is that the injuries could have been misattributed or not immediately evident. However, the probability that they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being low because significant injuries like those described (especially internal ones) would likely be detected during an autopsy even if not immediately noted.

Given these considerations and the need to make a judgment based on the provided scenario, the likelihood that the injuries were not present is relatively low because it is likely that such significant injuries would have been caused before death or during the agonal period.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries to Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other accidental or natural causes, rather than being inflicted by Jane.

The new information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This suggests that these specific injuries could be explained by causes other than Jane's actions.

Given this new understanding, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes more plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be found in Ben due to natural causes or circumstances surrounding his death and subsequent medical handling.

The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death directly supports the likelihood of its presence in the context of Jane's innocence. Similarly, the dislocated ribs being attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts provides a plausible alternative explanation for their presence.

Therefore, considering Jane's innocence and the new information, it is quite likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben because they can be explained by natural causes or the circumstances of his death and medical treatment.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted trauma by Jane.

The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering. Petechiae are often considered a sign of asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence is not universal in such cases, and their absence does not definitively rule out asphyxiation.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, as suggested by Jane's innocence, it would be expected that typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be absent.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is consistent with his death being due to a natural cause rather than smothering.

Given Jane's innocence and the implication that Ben's death was not due to smothering, the absence of petechiae is expected.

Probability judgment: 90
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to any inflicted trauma or smothering by Jane.

The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation. The new information that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby supports this explanation.

If Jane is not guilty, it is likely that Andy's injuries could be attributed to the resuscitation attempts or other accidental or natural causes. The fact that the initial post-mortem did not note these injuries but they were later found upon re-examination suggests that they might not have been immediately apparent or were not considered significant at the time.

Given Jane's innocence, the presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts is plausible and expected. It is reasonable to assume that attempts to revive Andy could have resulted in such injuries.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be explained by the circumstances surrounding his death and the attempts to revive him.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse. However, it's stated that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital.

2. **Considering the Condition if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (or omissions) that constitute murder. In this context, an alternative explanation could be that their deaths were due to natural or accidental causes, such as SIDS.

3. **Analyzing the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are significant and could be indicative of a traumatic event or severe abuse. If Jane is not guilty, these injuries would need to have another explanation.

4. **The Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is a critical piece of information. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct initial assessments of patients, including checking for visible injuries or abnormalities. The absence of a notation of these injuries could suggest that they were not visible or present at the time of hospital admission, or they might have been missed.

However, given the severity of the injuries described (e.g., rib and spinal cord injuries), it's plausible that at least some of these should have been detected or suspected during a medical examination, assuming they were present.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that Ben's death and injuries could be due to an accident or another cause not related to Jane's actions. For the injuries not to have been noted by nurses, they either occurred after hospital admission or were not readily apparent.

Given that medical professionals conduct thorough initial assessments, if the injuries were severe and present upon arrival, it's reasonable to expect that they should have been noticed. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative explanation for Ben's death and injuries, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being plausible, primarily because it supports the notion that Jane did not cause them before bringing Ben to the hospital.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively).

2. **Injuries found on Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

3. **Nurses' observation**: The injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

4. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or any other form of abuse). In this case, we are considering an alternative explanation for their deaths, such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

5. **Considering the nature of the injuries**: The injuries found on Ben are significant and indicative of some form of trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that these injuries might have occurred post-mortem or were not related to her actions. 

6. **Hospital observation**: The fact that nurses did not observe these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not present at that time or they were not immediately visible.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries to not have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we would have to consider that the injuries occurred after Ben's arrival at the hospital or were not detectable at that time.

The injuries described (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are serious and typically would be expected to be identified or suspected during a medical examination, especially in a hospital setting where infants are handled with care and examined thoroughly.

However, it's also possible that some injuries could have occurred or become apparent post-mortem.

Given the context and assuming Jane's innocence, we are evaluating the probability that the injuries were not present or not observable when Ben was brought to the hospital.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This low probability reflects the seriousness and nature of the injuries, suggesting they were likely present and potentially observable. However, it also acknowledges that there could be scenarios where the injuries were not immediately apparent or occurred very shortly after hospital admission, though the latter is less likely given the nature of the injuries described.

To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Understanding the new information**: The spinal bleeding is stated to be a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

2. **Implication of Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death for both Andy and Ben was not due to her actions (i.e., not murder).

3. **Relevance of the new information to Ben's autopsy findings**: The new information provides alternative explanations for the injuries found on Ben. Specifically, it suggests that the spinal bleeding could be consistent with a natural death, and the dislocated ribs could be attributed to either post-mortem changes or the result of resuscitation efforts.

4. **Assessing the likelihood**: Given that Jane is not guilty and the new information on the possible causes of the observed injuries, it becomes more plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be found in Ben as a result of natural or accidental processes rather than due to any inflicted trauma.

5. **Probability assessment**: The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs likely being due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes make it more likely that these findings are consistent with Jane not being guilty.

**Probability Judgment: 80**

This high probability judgment reflects that, given Jane's innocence and the alternative explanations for the injuries (spinal bleeding consistent with natural death and dislocated ribs due to resuscitation or post-mortem changes), it is quite likely that these findings could be present in Ben.

80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

2. **New information**: The injuries found on Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts, especially in a baby.

3. **Implication of Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means that Andy's death was not due to her actions.

4. **Assessing the likelihood of Andy's injuries**: Given that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, it is plausible that they occurred during efforts to revive Andy.

5. **Considering the context**: Resuscitation attempts can sometimes cause injuries, and in the context of Jane not being guilty, it suggests that Andy's injuries could be a result of medical intervention rather than abuse.

6. **Evaluating the probability**: If Jane is not guilty, the presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts makes it more likely that Andy's injuries are explained by these attempts rather than by any inflicted trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 90**

This high probability reflects that, given Jane's innocence and the explanation that Andy's injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, it is very likely that these injuries could be found in Andy.

90
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given context.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Ben died, and autopsy findings included certain injuries, but not others typically associated with smothering, like petechiae.

2. **Petechiae and smothering**: Petechiae are often cited as a potential indicator of asphyxiation or smothering, though their presence or absence is not definitive.

3. **Implication of Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death was not due to her actions, implying it could be due to natural causes or other non-criminal factors.

4. **Assessing the likelihood**: The absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering in Ben's case is more likely if Jane is not guilty because it supports the notion that Ben's death was not due to smothering or asphyxiation caused by Jane.

5. **Evaluating the probability**: Given that Jane is not guilty, it is expected that the autopsy findings would not show evidence of smothering, such as petechiae. Thus, the absence of these injuries is consistent with her innocence.

**Probability Judgment: 90**

This high probability judgment reflects that if Jane is not guilty, it is very likely that Ben would not have injuries typical of smothering, such as petechiae, because his death was not caused by smothering.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider several factors and the context provided.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons by smothering them. The injuries found on Ben (and later discovered on Andy through further examination of autopsy photographs) suggest possible smothering or severe physical harm.

2. **The condition of Ben upon hospital arrival**: The fact that nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. It implies either that the injuries were not visible or not present at that time.

3. **Implications of Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother or harm her children. This implies that the deaths and injuries could be due to other causes, potentially SIDS or another medical condition.

4. **Assessing the likelihood**: The injuries on Ben included damage that could potentially be post-mortem or not immediately visible. However, the question posits Jane's innocence, suggesting we consider alternative explanations.

   - If Jane is innocent, and the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained condition, it's still necessary to explain the injuries found on Ben. 
   - SIDS does not typically involve the kind of injuries described (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage, hemorrhages). These injuries suggest trauma.
   - The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon arrival could imply they were not visible or were not present.

However, injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and internal damage are typically not characteristic of SIDS and are more indicative of some form of trauma or abuse. The presence of such injuries makes it less likely that the deaths were simply SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not caused by her, then one must consider other explanations for both the deaths and the injuries. 

Given that the injuries on Ben were significant (including internal injuries like rib and spinal cord damage), it is less plausible that they occurred after hospital arrival if we are to believe Jane's innocence. 

The scenario that the injuries were not present or not visible when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on alternative explanations for the cause of death and the origin of the injuries. 

Since the injuries found are not typical of SIDS and suggest some form of trauma, and assuming Jane's innocence implies someone or something else caused these injuries, it becomes challenging to directly link the absence of noted injuries by nurses to Jane's innocence without more information on the timing and nature of these injuries.

However, given that the injuries were not noted by nurses and assuming Jane's innocence, one might consider it less likely that the injuries were inflicted after being brought to the hospital, as this could imply negligence or action by hospital staff, which is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and available information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, potentially aligning with the alternative explanation of SIDS or another natural cause.

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of significant trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not inflict these injuries.

The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important piece of information. There are a few possible explanations for this:

1. **The injuries were not present or not observable at the time of admission**: It's possible that the injuries occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital. However, given the nature of the injuries (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord), it's less likely they could have occurred post-admission without being noticed, especially if they were significant enough to be identified during an autopsy.

2. **The injuries were present but not noticed by the nurses**: Nurses might have missed these injuries during their initial assessment, especially if they were not immediately life-threatening or if they were not easily observable.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, one has to consider alternative explanations for the injuries, such as a misinterpretation of the autopsy findings or an alternative cause that doesn't involve Jane.

However, the question specifically asks for the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty. 

If we assume Jane's innocence and that the injuries are not related to her actions, we still need to consider how likely it is that such significant injuries were not observed by medical staff upon admission.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-admission or being missed by medical staff.

While it's difficult to assign a precise probability without more specific information about the nature of the injuries and the hospital procedures, one could argue that significant injuries like those described are likely to be detected by medical professionals upon examination.

However, considering that the exact nature and timing of the injuries are not detailed beyond the autopsy findings, and medical professionals might not always detect every injury during initial assessments, there is some room for the possibility that the injuries were either not present or not observed at the time of admission.

Given the context and the available information, a cautious assessment might lean towards a relatively low probability that such significant injuries were not present or not observable upon admission, but the exact figure depends on various factors including the specifics of the medical examination and the nature of the injuries.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries described for Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries.

2. **Implication of the Injuries**: The presence of such injuries typically suggests a violent or traumatic cause, such as smothering or shaking. If Jane is not guilty, then these injuries would not be a result of her actions.

3. **Detection by Nurses**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply a few things: either the injuries were not visible or not present at the time, or they were missed by the medical staff.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death might be related to other factors such as SIDS or an accidental cause not related to her direct actions. However, the injuries found on Ben (and later on Andy upon re-examination) suggest a traumatic cause rather than SIDS or accidental death.

5. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another non-traumatic cause, it's still challenging to explain the presence of the injuries found on Ben and Andy. 

6. **Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present**: For the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital (assuming Jane is not guilty and thus did not inflict them), there would need to be an alternative explanation for their presence post-mortem. This could involve post-mortem changes or mishandling of the body.

7. **Evaluating the Probability**: The injuries described are not typical of SIDS or post-mortem changes but rather indicative of trauma. If Jane is not guilty, one must consider the possibility that the injuries were not noticed or documented correctly by the hospital staff, or occurred post-mortem due to handling or other factors. However, the detailed nature of the injuries (e.g., hypoxic damage, hemorrhages) suggests they were likely ante-mortem.

Given these considerations, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether one believes the injuries could have been missed or occurred post-mortem. The detailed and significant nature of the injuries makes it less likely that they were entirely missed by medical staff, and more likely they were present.

Therefore, considering the presence of significant injuries that are not typically associated with SIDS and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying an alternative, non-traumatic cause of death), the likelihood that these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is relatively low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context of the case.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of Ben led to further investigation into Andy's death, revealing potential signs of non-natural death.

2. **Injuries on Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including damage to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital.

3. **Implications if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or any other form of abuse or violence inflicted by her).

4. **Alternative explanation - SIDS**: The deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the presence of injuries on Ben (and potentially on Andy upon further examination) complicates this explanation.

5. **Assessing the likelihood regarding Ben's injuries**: If Jane is not guilty, the critical question is whether the injuries on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or were not observable by nurses due to other reasons.

- **Post-mortem injuries**: It's possible for injuries to occur after death, during handling or autopsy procedures, though this is generally not the case for the type of injuries described (e.g., hemorrhages, hypoxic damage). These typically indicate trauma or events preceding death.

- **Observability by nurses**: Nurses are trained to observe and document injuries or signs of trauma. However, some injuries might not be immediately apparent or could be internal.

6. **Given Jane is not guilty, the consideration**: If Jane is not guilty, one would have to assume the injuries either occurred post-mortem or were not detectable upon initial examination.

The injuries found on Ben (like hemorrhages and hypoxic damage) are indicative of an event or condition occurring before death. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the absence of other perpetrators or causes, the most plausible alternative is that these injuries were either misinterpreted or not the result of Jane's actions.

However, the fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon initial examination doesn't necessarily imply they weren't present; the injuries could have been internal or not immediately obvious.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

(This implies that if Jane is not guilty, there's a moderate likelihood (60%) that the injuries found on Ben were either not observable upon initial hospital examination or were considered not to be present in a manner that was detectable by the nurses. This judgment reflects a nuanced understanding that some injuries might not be immediately apparent, but also acknowledges that significant injuries like those described are typically noteworthy.)
To determine the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The case against her partly relies on the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy, which included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the Injuries and Their Detection**: The injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to another cause, such as SIDS, or an accident/unexplained cause not related to her actions.

3. **Analyzing the Possibility of Injuries Not Being Present at the Hospital**: If Jane is not guilty, then the critical question is whether the injuries found on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or were not detected by hospital staff. 

4. **Considering Post-Mortem Injuries**: Some injuries found during an autopsy could potentially occur after death. For instance, certain types of handling or procedures during or after death could result in injuries that were not present or not visible when the infant was alive or immediately after death.

5. **Hospital Procedures and Detection of Injuries**: Nurses and medical staff are trained to observe and document injuries or signs of trauma. However, it's also possible for minor or certain types of injuries to be overlooked, especially if they are not immediately visible or if the primary focus is on saving the infant's life.

6. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on whether these injuries could be post-mortem or were simply not detected. 

7. **Reasoning**: Given that the injuries were not noted by nurses, if we are to believe Jane is not guilty, it's plausible that the injuries occurred post-mortem, either during hospital procedures or after death but before the autopsy. Some of the injuries described (like hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) could be consistent with attempts at resuscitation or post-mortem changes rather than ante-mortem trauma.

8. **Conclusion**: The likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, is relatively high because it is possible that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not detected by the hospital staff.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other factors such as SIDS or other natural causes, or potentially other accidental or external factors not related to Jane's actions.

The injuries found on Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries that are typically associated with non-accidental trauma in the context of infant deaths.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important detail. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations as part of their care. However, it's also known that not all injuries, especially those that are internal or not immediately visible, may be detected during an initial examination.

If Jane is not guilty, then the assumption is that Ben's death and injuries could have occurred due to other reasons, not due to her actions. In such a case, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-mortem or being missed by the medical staff.

For the injuries to have occurred post-mortem and not be related to Jane's actions, they would have had to happen after Ben was pronounced dead or during the handling of the body in a way that doesn't implicate Jane in causing them before death. However, the nature of the injuries (e.g., hypoxic damage, hemorrhages) suggests they occurred before death.

The alternative explanation is that the injuries were present but not detected by the nurses. Medical professionals might miss certain injuries, especially if they are not immediately visible or if the examination did not include specific tests to identify them.

Given that the injuries are of a serious nature typically associated with non-accidental injury and assuming Jane is not guilty, it strains credibility to suggest these injuries occurred post-mortem without any implication of Jane or someone else causing them. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming the injuries are genuine and not fabricated, it is more plausible that they were present but perhaps not immediately obvious or detected during the initial examination.

However, if we are to consider the probability that these significant injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we are essentially evaluating the likelihood of an alternative explanation that doesn't implicate Jane.

The probability judgment here is based on the reasonableness of the injuries being missed or occurring post-mortem without implicating Jane. Given the nature of the injuries and typical medical practices, it seems less likely that such significant injuries would be entirely missed.

Probability judgment: 20
The absence of certain injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben, despite other significant injuries being found, is an interesting observation. Petechiae are often considered in the context of asphyxiation or smothering because they can be indicative of the struggle or the physical stress associated with such acts.

If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of Ben's death is not attributed to her actions, potentially aligning with the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae. The presence of other significant injuries (e.g., to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages) could be attributed to other causes or mechanisms that might not necessarily include smothering.

The likelihood of the absence of petechiae or other typical smothering injuries if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because it supports the notion that Ben's death might not have been due to smothering by Jane. Other causes, potentially accidental or natural, could be considered, and the absence of petechiae might be more consistent with these alternative explanations.

Moreover, it's worth noting that the presence of petechiae is not universal in cases of smothering, and their absence does not definitively rule out asphyxiation or smothering. However, in the context of Jane not being guilty, the absence of these injuries might be seen as more plausible or consistent with alternative explanations for Ben's death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries is somewhat more likely or at least not contradictory to this premise.

Probability judgment: 70
If Jane is not guilty, this implies that the deaths of her children, including Ben, were not due to her actions. The information that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation for the injuries found on Ben.

The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death directly supports the notion that Ben's death could have been due to natural causes, which aligns with Jane not being guilty. Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts, this further supports the idea that the injuries found on Ben are not necessarily indicative of non-accidental trauma caused by Jane.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is quite plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben because these can be explained by natural causes or medical interventions rather than by Jane's actions.

The likelihood of these findings under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is relatively high because the explanations provided for the injuries (natural death for spinal bleeding and post-mortem or resuscitation-related for dislocated ribs) are consistent with this scenario.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the deaths or injuries to her children through non-accidental means. The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If these injuries are indeed due to resuscitation attempts, as initially thought, then their presence is consistent with efforts to save Andy's life rather than with any intentional harm caused by Jane. The fact that such injuries can be associated with medical interventions aimed at reviving a baby supports the notion that they could have occurred during the attempts to save Andy.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of these injuries in Andy is plausible because they can be explained by the resuscitation efforts. It is reasonable to expect that attempts to revive a baby, especially if vigorous or involving certain procedures, could result in such injuries.

The likelihood of these injuries being found in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because the explanation that they resulted from resuscitation attempts is consistent with her not being guilty of causing them through non-accidental trauma.

To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical implications.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of smothering her two sons, Andy and Ben. The autopsy on Ben revealed several injuries, including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, typical signs associated with smothering, like petechiae, were not found.

2. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of injuries in Ben (and retrospectively found in Andy) led to the suspicion of smothering rather than SIDS.

3. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are often cited as a potential sign of asphyxia or smothering, although their presence is not exclusive to these causes. The absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the presence and visibility of petechiae can be influenced by various factors, including the method and duration of smothering, and individual physiological responses.

4. **Assessing the Absence of Petechiae if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found on Ben would then need an alternative explanation. Some research suggests that certain injuries can be found in cases of SIDS, although the presence of significant injuries like those described is unusual.

5. **Likelihood of Absence of Petechiae**: The key issue is whether the absence of petechiae is consistent with a natural death (like SIDS) or if it's inconsistent with smothering. In cases of SIDS, one would not typically expect to find petechiae as SIDS is not caused by smothering or asphyxia (by definition, it's a diagnosis made after excluding such causes).

6. **Probability Judgment**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not involve the kind of asphyxial mechanisms that typically cause petechiae. Therefore, the absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with a diagnosis of SIDS or a similar natural cause.

Given this context, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty (and assuming the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS) is relatively high because SIDS does not typically present with signs of asphyxia like petechiae.

To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

First, let's understand that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to another cause, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age, without any clear cause or mechanism identified after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The presence of certain injuries in Ben (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and the subsequent findings in Andy's autopsy photographs (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) led to the suspicion of smothering. However, the question focuses on the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben.

Petechiae are small spots on the skin that occur due to bleeding from small capillaries. They can be a sign of smothering or other forms of asphyxia because they result from the increase in venous pressure during a struggle to breathe against an obstruction. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not a definitive indicator of smothering, as their occurrence can vary.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically involve the kind of asphyxial struggle that can cause petechiae.

The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys. While this information provides context, it doesn't directly inform us about the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in a case of SIDS versus a case of smothering.

However, if we consider that the absence of petechiae is being discussed in the context of Ben's death, and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the death might not be due to smothering), we are essentially being asked to evaluate how likely it is for a non-suffocated infant (potentially dying from SIDS or another cause) not to have petechiae.

Petechiae are not a universal finding in smothering deaths; their presence is variable. In cases where smothering is not the cause of death (e.g., SIDS), the absence of petechiae would be expected because the mechanism of death does not involve the kind of asphyxial stress that typically leads to petechiae.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death is not due to smothering but possibly SIDS or another natural cause, the absence of petechiae is quite likely because these conditions do not typically involve the pathophysiological processes that result in petechiae.

Given this context, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is relatively high.

**85**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we must understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

First, let's consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, which implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane.

1. **Understanding SIDS and Smothering**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. Smothering, on the other hand, involves obstructing the airway, which can lead to asphyxia. The presence of certain injuries, such as petechiae, can be indicative of a struggle or asphyxial death. However, the absence of such injuries doesn't necessarily rule out asphyxia or smothering.

2. **Injuries Found on Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids. These findings are suggestive of significant trauma or asphyxial event. However, the absence of petechiae is noted.

3. **Petechiae and Smothering**: Petechiae are tiny hemorrhages that can occur due to increased venous pressure during a struggle or asphyxiation. While they can be associated with smothering, their presence is not universal in such cases, and their absence doesn't exclude smothering.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of death for Ben might not be smothering or any form of intentional act by Jane. In such a case, the expectation is that Ben's death could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the injuries found on Ben are not typical for SIDS, which usually doesn't present with significant traumatic injuries.

Given the injuries found on Ben are not typical for SIDS and are more suggestive of a traumatic or asphyxial event, if we were to assume Jane is not guilty (and thus Ben's death wasn't due to smothering by Jane), we would still need to explain the presence of these injuries.

The absence of petechiae in a case where there's a suspicion of smothering (due to other injuries being present) could be considered relatively likely if one were to hypothesize an alternative cause that doesn't involve a typical asphyxial struggle (since petechiae are more commonly associated with such a struggle). However, the presence of other significant injuries on Ben already points away from a typical SIDS diagnosis.

The probability we're being asked to assess isn't directly related to the guilt or innocence per se but rather the likelihood of not observing certain injuries (like petechiae) under the assumption of innocence.

Since the presence or absence of petechiae can vary widely in cases of asphyxia or smothering, and given that Ben did have other significant injuries indicative of trauma or asphyxia, the absence of petechiae might not be entirely unexpected, but it's still somewhat unusual in a context suggesting possible asphyxiation.

To provide a probability judgment on the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty (and thus assuming an alternative cause of death for Ben that isn't smothering by Jane), we must acknowledge that the scenario doesn't directly align with typical SIDS due to the presence of significant injuries.

However, given that the question doesn't directly relate to the probability of Jane's guilt or innocence but rather the likelihood of a specific medical finding under the assumption of innocence, and considering the complexity and variability of forensic pathology findings in infant deaths, a precise probability is challenging to quantify without more specific statistical data on the frequency of petechiae in deaths due to various causes.

**60**
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the medical aspects involved.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. Given the information, an alternative explanation for their deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The presence of injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, initially suggested to the investigators that the deaths might not be natural or due to SIDS, potentially indicating smothering or another form of infant abuse.

However, the question focuses on the absence of certain injuries typically associated with smothering, like petechiae, in Ben. Petechiae are often considered a sign of asphyxiation or smothering due to the increased venous pressure causing rupture of small blood vessels. 

The absence of petechiae in Ben, despite other significant injuries, is somewhat puzzling if one assumes smothering was the cause of death. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive for diagnosing smothering; their presence is not universal in asphyxial deaths, and their absence does not rule out asphyxia or smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, and we consider the hypothesis that Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS deaths typically do not present with such signs of asphyxiation or trauma indicative of smothering.

Thus, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause (supporting Jane's innocence), it is plausible that he would not have petechiae because his death was not due to smothering.

Therefore, given Jane is not guilty and assuming Ben's death was due to a cause like SIDS, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae is relatively high because SIDS does not involve the kind of asphyxiation that typically results in petechiae.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that Ben's death was not due to her actions, potentially supporting the hypothesis that his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the presence of significant injuries (to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) complicates this interpretation because such injuries are not typical for SIDS.

The fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply a few things:
1. The injuries were not immediately visible or were not significant enough to be noticed during the initial examination at the hospital.
2. The injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital.

If Jane is not guilty, the most plausible explanation is that the injuries were not immediately apparent or were not present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital. However, given the severity of the injuries described (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord), it is somewhat unlikely that they would not have been detected if they were present at the time of hospital admission, unless they were not immediately visible or were internal.

The scenario that the injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital is highly unlikely and would imply some form of negligence or action by hospital staff, which is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence.

Given Jane's innocence, if we consider that Ben's condition could be due to a natural cause or an accident not related to Jane's actions, the likelihood that the injuries were not present or not noticeable when Ben was brought to the hospital is relatively high. This is because it would be challenging to explain how such significant injuries occurred without being noticed if they were present at the time of admission.

Probability judgment: 70
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions. Given the new information that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, we can reassess the likelihood of these findings.

The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death increases the likelihood of its occurrence in Ben if his death was natural (e.g., due to SIDS). Similarly, if the dislocated ribs are attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, this explanation is plausible and not necessarily indicative of non-accidental injury.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, it becomes more plausible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be found in Ben due to the explanations provided (natural death and resuscitation or post-mortem changes, respectively).

Given Jane's innocence and the alternative explanations for the findings, the likelihood of observing spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben increases because these can be attributed to natural or iatrogenic causes rather than non-accidental injury.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions. The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If the injuries are indeed due to resuscitation attempts, as suggested, this provides a plausible explanation for their presence that is not related to Jane's guilt or innocence in terms of causing non-accidental injury.

Given Jane's innocence, if we consider that Andy's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts becomes a plausible explanation.

The likelihood of the injuries found in Andy, given Jane's innocence and the attribution of these injuries to resuscitation attempts, is relatively high because it provides a plausible and innocent explanation for their presence.

## Step 1: Understand the given information about Ben's autopsy findings.
The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, it's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Assess the implications of the given conditions on the likelihood of the autopsy findings if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. An alternative explanation given is SIDS. The findings on Ben's autopsy need to be evaluated in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the specific autopsy findings in Ben under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we consider the possibility that Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause. The presence of spinal bleeding is stated to be a common finding in natural death, which supports the possibility that it could occur in a case of SIDS or another natural cause. The dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts, which are not indicative of foul play during life.

## Step 4: Consider the probability of the autopsy findings occurring naturally.
Since spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and dislocated ribs can occur due to resuscitation or post-mortem handling, these findings do not necessarily indicate foul play. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings should be considered in the context of natural causes or accidental injuries during medical intervention.

## Step 5: Assess the overall likelihood.
The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs can be explained by natural causes or procedures related to the attempt to save Ben's life. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that these findings could still occur.

## Step 6: Quantify the likelihood based on the given information.
The key information is that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs are likely due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling. This implies that these findings are not necessarily inconsistent with a natural death or SIDS.

## Step 7: Provide a probability judgment.
Given that the spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs can be attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem handling, it is reasonable to consider that these findings could occur even if Jane is not guilty. The exact probability depends on how likely these specific findings are in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Ben's autopsy findings
Ben's autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, it's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Assess the likelihood of the autopsy findings if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. In this scenario, we are considering the possibility that their deaths could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Evaluate the autopsy findings in the context of SIDS or natural death
The presence of spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death suggests that it could be consistent with a natural cause of death. The dislocated ribs, if they occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, also do not necessarily indicate foul play.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of the autopsy findings for Jane's guilt or innocence
If Jane is not guilty, the autopsy findings should be explainable by other factors. The fact that spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and that dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts provides alternative explanations for Ben's autopsy findings.

## Step 5: Determine the likelihood of the observed autopsy findings in Ben if Jane is not guilty
Given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs can be explained by post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, it is plausible that these findings could occur even if Jane is not guilty.

## Step 6: Assess the probability
Since the spinal bleeding is common in natural death and the dislocated ribs have plausible alternative explanations (post-mortem or due to resuscitation), the presence of these findings does not necessarily imply Jane's guilt. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, it is relatively likely that such findings could still be observed due to other causes.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood
The information provided about the autopsy findings and their possible explanations suggests that if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is quite high because these can be associated with natural causes or procedural factors like resuscitation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Ben's autopsy findings.
The autopsy findings for Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, it's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Assess the likelihood of the findings if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. In this case, we need to consider alternative explanations for their deaths, such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Evaluate the autopsy findings in the context of SIDS or natural death.
For Ben, the spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death suggests that it could be consistent with a natural cause of death, such as SIDS. The dislocated ribs, if they occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, also do not necessarily indicate foul play.

## Step 4: Consider the probability of the autopsy findings occurring naturally.
Given that the spinal bleeding is common in natural death and the dislocated ribs can be attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation, these findings can occur in the context of a natural death.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to natural causes like SIDS, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs (with the given explanations) would be higher because these can be associated with natural deaths or the circumstances surrounding the death (e.g., resuscitation attempts).

## Step 6: Quantify the likelihood based on the information provided.
The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000. However, the presence of certain autopsy findings (like spinal bleeding being common in natural death and dislocated ribs due to resuscitation or post-mortem handling) doesn't directly relate to the frequency of SIDS but rather to how likely these findings are in a natural death scenario.

## Step 7: Consider the context of the question.
The question is asking for the likelihood of certain autopsy findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) if Jane is not guilty, implying the deaths were natural.

## Step 8: Evaluate the probability.
Since spinal bleeding is stated to be a common finding in natural death and dislocated ribs can be explained by resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling, these findings are plausible in the context of a natural death. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, it is relatively likely that such findings could occur.

## Step 9: Assign a probability judgment.
Given the information that the spinal bleeding is common in natural death and the dislocated ribs have plausible alternative explanations, the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty is relatively high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context of the case.

1. **Spinal bleeding**: It is stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. If Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, and not due to smothering or any other unnatural cause inflicted by Jane, the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with a natural death.

2. **Dislocated ribs**: The information provided suggests that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was not due to her actions, it is plausible that the dislocated ribs were a result of resuscitation efforts rather than an indication of pre-mortem trauma.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., they were not smothered by her). Under this assumption:

- The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural death, which aligns with the hypothesis that Ben died of natural causes (potentially SIDS), making its occurrence plausible.
- The dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling is also plausible, as these are known causes unrelated to Jane's guilt.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering a scenario where Ben's death was due to natural causes. The findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, under this scenario, are not necessarily indicative of foul play but can be explained by other factors (natural death and resuscitation attempts/post-mortem changes, respectively).

Hence, the likelihood of these findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) in Ben, given Jane is not guilty, is relatively high because they can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about the case and the condition of Ben's body after autopsy.
The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. However, it's given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Analyze the implications of the given information if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. In this case, we need to consider alternative explanations for their deaths, such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Consider the likelihood of the findings in Ben's autopsy if his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.
Given that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, this condition could be consistent with a natural cause of death. The dislocated ribs, if they occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, would also be consistent with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to Jane's actions but rather a natural or accidental cause.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the autopsy findings in Ben if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs (if attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation) could be considered plausible or expected findings. The key here is understanding that these findings, under the assumption of Jane's innocence, need to be evaluated for their likelihood given a natural cause of death.

## Step 5: Evaluate the specific autopsy findings in the context of SIDS or natural death.
SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While certain autopsy findings like spinal bleeding might be seen in various conditions, including natural deaths, the presence of such findings doesn't necessarily rule out SIDS or other natural causes outright. The dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling provides a plausible explanation that is unrelated to Jane's guilt.

## Step 6: Determine the likelihood based on the given conditions and the nature of the autopsy findings.
Since spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural death and dislocated ribs can be attributed to factors unrelated to Jane's actions (like resuscitation attempts), these findings could be likely even if Jane is not guilty.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood.
Given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs can be explained by factors other than Jane's guilt (such as resuscitation attempts), it is reasonable to consider that these findings could occur even if Jane is innocent. Thus, the likelihood of these findings, given Jane's innocence, is relatively high because they can be explained by factors consistent with a natural cause of death or post-mortem handling.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To determine the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

1. **Spinal bleeding in natural death**: It's stated that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death. This suggests that if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding would not be unusual.

2. **Dislocated ribs post-mortem or due to resuscitation**: The information provided indicates that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Ben's death was natural (SIDS), and not due to smothering or any other unnatural cause attributed to Jane, then it's plausible that the dislocated ribs were a result of resuscitation efforts rather than an indication of foul play.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of harm inflicted by her. In such a scenario, if we consider SIDS or another natural cause as the reason for their deaths, the findings in Ben's autopsy related to spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs need to be evaluated in the context of natural deaths and medical procedures (like resuscitation).

The spinal bleeding, being a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs, likely resulting from resuscitation attempts, would both be plausible in the context of a natural death or an unpreventable medical emergency.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and the deaths were due to natural causes or factors unrelated to her actions, it is likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would still be found in Ben as these can be associated with natural death or the consequences of medical intervention.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions, such as smothering. The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of injuries that could be consistent with resuscitation attempts becomes more plausible as an explanation. The fact that the initial autopsy did not detect these injuries and they were only found after re-examination in light of Ben's autopsy results suggests that they might not have been immediately obvious or considered significant at the time.

The injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation for their presence if Andy's death was sudden and unexpected, prompting vigorous resuscitation efforts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and considering that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts, it is plausible that Andy had such injuries.

Probability judgment: 85
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of harm inflicted by her. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be expected if Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence or absence is not definitive proof. The fact that no such injuries were found in Ben's autopsy supports the possibility that his death was not due to smothering.

If Ben's death was due to a natural cause, the absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering would be likely.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is quite likely because it aligns with the scenario where Ben died from a natural cause rather than being smothered.

Probability judgment: 90
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's injuries were either due to natural causes, accidental injury, or possibly related to medical procedures.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests one of two possibilities: either the injuries were not present at that time, or they were present but not noticed or documented by the medical staff.

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, it's plausible that any injuries found during the autopsy could have occurred post-mortem, during resuscitation attempts, or were not readily apparent to the medical staff.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on whether they could have occurred during the period between arrival at the hospital and the autopsy. If the injuries were likely to have occurred post-mortem or were subtle enough not to be noticed by medical staff, then it's possible they were not present or not apparent when Ben was brought to the hospital.

Given this, if Jane is not guilty, and if we consider that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not easily detectable, it's plausible that the injuries were not present or not noted when Ben was brought to the hospital.

To assess the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

First, it's stated that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death. This implies that if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of spinal bleeding could be expected and is not necessarily indicative of foul play.

Second, the dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the dislocated ribs could reasonably be explained by the medical interventions (resuscitation attempts) that occurred after Ben was found unwell.

Given these explanations, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are plausible without implying foul play. The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs can be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes, it is reasonably likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context of the case and the nature of the death.

Petechiae are often associated with asphyxial deaths, including smothering, because they can result from the increased venous pressure during a struggle or the mechanical obstruction of the airway. However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not a definitive indicator of smothering or asphyxia, as their occurrence can vary widely.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS. SIDS deaths are characterized by a lack of specific pathological findings that would explain the death. In other words, SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when other causes of death have been ruled out.

The absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering in Ben's case would be expected if his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, as these injuries are more commonly associated with asphyxial or traumatic deaths.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, it is likely that there would be an absence of injuries such as petechiae, as these are not characteristic of SIDS.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS. The injuries found on Ben, such as the dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding, have been explained as either occurring post-mortem or as a result of resuscitation attempts.

If Ben died of natural causes, it is plausible that the injuries were sustained during the resuscitation efforts or post-mortem handling, rather than being present before or at the time of hospital admission.

The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries upon initial examination supports the explanation that they might have occurred subsequently, either during resuscitation attempts or after death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present or not apparent when he was brought to the hospital, as they could be attributed to subsequent medical interventions or post-mortem changes.

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the explanations provided for those injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS. The injuries found on Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause, it's plausible that the injuries found could be due to the resuscitation efforts, as these can sometimes cause minor injuries, especially in infants.

The explanation that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible alternative to attributing them to Jane's actions. If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was natural, it is reasonable to expect that the injuries could still be present due to the medical interventions that occurred.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is still plausible, as they can be explained by the resuscitation attempts.

To address this question, let's break down the given information and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries suggestive of possible smothering or violent treatment (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). Further investigation on Andy's autopsy photographs also revealed signs that could be indicative of trauma (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung).

2. **The Condition of Ben Upon Hospital Arrival**: It's stated that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering or any form of intentional harm). An alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

4. **Analyzing the Injuries on Ben**: The presence of specific injuries on Ben (and the later discovered evidence on Andy) is crucial. If Jane is not guilty, these injuries need to be explained by other means. 

5. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital is significant. If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it implies that the injuries must have occurred post-mortem or were missed during the initial examination.

6. **Post-Mortem Injuries or Missed During Examination**: The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on whether these injuries could have occurred post-mortem. Autopsy procedures and the nature of the injuries can sometimes help differentiate between ante-mortem and post-mortem injuries.

7. **Probability Judgment**: To make a judgment, we need to consider the plausibility of the injuries occurring after Ben's arrival at the hospital or being missed by the nurses. 

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not a result of her actions, several factors come into play:
- The nature of the injuries (whether they could realistically occur post-mortem).
- The handling and examination procedures at the hospital.
- The possibility of the injuries being missed.

Given the lack of specific details on the nature of the injuries and hospital procedures, we're left to make an educated guess based on general principles.

If the injuries were severe enough to be detected during an autopsy, it's plausible they could have been missed by nurses if they were not overtly visible or if the examination was not thorough for such injuries. However, significant injuries like those described might be expected to be noticed.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty involves considering alternative explanations for the injuries. If we assume Jane's innocence and that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of the described injuries becomes harder to explain as part of the events leading to death.

However, without direct evidence that the injuries occurred post-mortem or were not present at the time of hospital admission, we're left with uncertainty.

Given these considerations and focusing on the specific question: If Jane is not guilty, how likely is it that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital?

The injuries being post-mortem or being missed are possibilities. However, quantifying this directly requires more specific information about the nature of the injuries and the hospital's handling and examination procedures.

**70**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during his autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the Injuries**: The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma. If these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it suggests that they occurred after he was admitted.

3. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the deaths and the injuries found on Ben must be attributed to other factors or explanations.

4. **Alternative Explanations**: One alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries on Ben contradicts a straightforward SIDS diagnosis for him, though it might still be considered for Andy.

5. **Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present at Admission**: If Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they must have occurred post-admission. This could imply negligence or an accident within the hospital setting, or some other post-admission event.

6. **Hospital Setting and Medical Handling**: Hospitals have protocols for handling infants, and significant injuries are not typical outcomes of standard medical care or handling. However, errors or accidents can occur.

7. **Nurses Not Noting Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought in could be due to several factors, including the nature of the injuries (e.g., internal injuries might not be immediately visible) or oversight.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital depends on factors like the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-admission and the credibility of the hospital's handling of Ben.

The injuries found on Ben are of a nature (e.g., to the ribs and spinal cord) that one would expect to be associated with significant external signs or symptoms, or to be noticed during medical handling and examination upon admission. 

Therefore, it is relatively unlikely that such significant injuries were not present or not observable upon admission unless they were internal and not immediately visible or unless there was a failure in the medical examination.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To address the question of how likely it is that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of non-accidental trauma (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). The defense is considering the possibility that Jane is not guilty, implying an alternative explanation for the children's deaths, such as SIDS.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben are significant and indicative of severe trauma. If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries needs to be explained by other factors or individuals.

3. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial. There are several possible explanations for this:
   - The injuries were not visible or not apparent at the time of admission (e.g., internal injuries that were not externally manifest).
   - The nurses did not conduct a thorough examination that would have revealed these injuries.
   - The injuries occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. In this context, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on whether someone or something else could have caused these injuries after Ben's admission to the hospital.

Given that hospitals have protocols in place for handling infants, including those brought in with severe distress, and that medical staff are trained to identify and document injuries or signs of trauma, it's less likely that significant external injuries would be missed. However, the presence of internal injuries or the possibility that the injuries were not immediately apparent could be factors.

Moreover, if we are to assume Jane's innocence, we are also assuming that the injuries could have been caused by another factor or individual. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses could suggest they either were not present or not visible at the time.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

This judgment reflects a considered likelihood, taking into account the complexities of medical examination and documentation, the nature of the injuries, and the assumption of Jane's innocence. It suggests that while it's possible the injuries were not present or not noted upon admission, there are valid reasons to question this, given the severity of the injuries described. Therefore, a moderate to somewhat high probability is assigned.

**60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse, such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The injuries found on Ben are serious and suggestive of a violent act or significant trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The alternative explanation given for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the presence of specific injuries on Ben (and later found on Andy upon re-examination) complicates this explanation since SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death without a clear cause upon autopsy.

4. **Injuries Not Noted by Nurses**: The fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital is a significant point. It raises questions about when these injuries occurred.

If Jane is not guilty, several possibilities exist:
- The injuries could have occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital. 
- The injuries might have been missed by the nurses due to their nature or subtlety, though this is less likely given the description of the injuries found during the autopsy.

Given the context that Jane is not guilty, we're examining the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital. If we assume Jane's innocence, we are left to consider other explanations for the injuries found on Ben.

The injuries being caused after hospital admission is a possibility, though medical staff and hospital environments are generally designed to minimize the risk of such injuries to infants. However, it's not impossible, as hospitals are not completely immune to accidents or potential misconduct by staff, though the latter is rare and subject to strict scrutiny.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, leans towards being relatively high because if Jane is innocent, we are looking for an alternative explanation for the injuries. However, the injuries described are typically associated with non-accidental injury rather than accidental or natural causes.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the injuries were not present upon hospital admission if Jane is not guilty because the scenario is heavily reliant on alternative explanations that are not strongly supported by the given context (e.g., someone else causing the injuries or an extremely rare hospital incident). The injuries suggest a serious and potentially non-accidental cause, making it less likely they occurred post-admission without anyone noticing or being responsible.
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane's two infants, Andy and Ben, died under different circumstances that led to an investigation. Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries, including to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings led to Jane being charged with their murder.

2. **Assessing the injuries and their discovery**: The injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital. This is crucial because it suggests that either the injuries were not visible or they were not present at the time of hospital admission.

3. **Considering Jane's innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. In this context, we need to evaluate the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.

4. **Medical and procedural considerations**: The fact that nurses did not notice the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could be due to several factors:
   - The injuries might not have been externally visible or were not in areas typically examined by nurses during initial assessment.
   - The injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, although this is less likely given the nature of the injuries described (e.g., to the ribs and spinal cord).
   - The examination by nurses might not have been thorough enough to detect these specific injuries, or they might have been subtle.

5. **Alternative explanation - SIDS**: The text also mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, the presence of significant injuries on Ben makes SIDS an unlikely explanation for his death unless the injuries are considered unrelated to the cause of death.

6. **Likelihood assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, there are a few possibilities:
   - The injuries could have been caused by someone or something else (though this is highly speculative and not directly supported by the information given).
   - The injuries might have occurred post-mortem or during the resuscitation efforts or handling of the body.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, one plausible interpretation is that the injuries could have occurred during medical intervention or handling, or they might not have been detectable during the initial hospital assessment. However, the detailed nature of the injuries (e.g., to the ribs and spinal cord) makes it less likely that they were entirely missed by hospital staff unless they were not externally visible or were internal injuries that weren't immediately apparent.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes such as SIDS, as mentioned. However, the presence of injuries on Ben (and the subsequent findings on Andy's autopsy photographs) complicates this, as these injuries are not typical of SIDS.

The question specifically asks us to consider the scenario where Jane is not guilty and to assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. 

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries described for Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and indicate some form of trauma or severe stress.

2. **Nurses Not Noting the Injuries**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply several things:
   - The injuries were not visible or not apparent at the time.
   - The nurses did not conduct a thorough examination that would have revealed these injuries.
   - The injuries occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.

3. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. Therefore, if the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they must have occurred afterwards.

Given the information and the condition that Jane is not guilty, we must consider the plausibility of the injuries occurring after Ben was brought to the hospital. Hospitals have protocols and supervision in place, making it less likely for such significant injuries to occur unnoticed. However, it's not impossible, as medical errors or other unforeseen circumstances could potentially lead to injuries.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's innocence, involves considering whether the injuries could have plausibly occurred in a hospital setting, either due to medical procedures or other accidents.

While it's concerning to think that a hospital might be the place where such injuries occur, the fact remains that medical interventions or mishaps can sometimes result in injuries.

However, the detailed nature of the injuries (to the ribs, spinal cord, etc.) suggests a level of force or trauma that is not typically associated with standard medical care or accidental injury in a hospital setting, though there are exceptions (e.g., during resuscitation efforts).

Given these considerations and focusing strictly on the question's condition (Jane is not guilty), we are left to ponder the likelihood based on the information given and general knowledge.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the nature of the injuries.

First, let's consider the injuries found on Ben: injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and serious injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). In that case, there are a few possibilities to consider regarding the injuries on Ben:

1. **The injuries could have occurred accidentally or due to another cause** before he was brought to the hospital. However, the nature of the injuries (to the ribs, spinal cord, etc.) suggests a significant force or trauma, which might not be easily explained by accidental injury or SIDS.

2. **The injuries might have been sustained during or after resuscitation efforts** by medical personnel. Some of the injuries, such as rib injuries, could potentially be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts, although this is not universally accepted and can be a subject of medical debate.

3. **The observation by nurses might not have included a thorough examination for these specific injuries**, or the injuries might not have been apparent at the time of admission.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, one would have to consider that they either occurred during medical handling or were not detectable at the time.

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there is an alternative plausible explanation for the injuries. If we consider that the injuries could potentially be a result of vigorous resuscitation or not immediately apparent, this scenario becomes more plausible.

However, without explicit information on the handling and examination of Ben at the hospital, or a clear alternative explanation for the injuries, we must rely on the context given.

The injuries found on Ben are serious and not typical of SIDS or normal medical handling. The fact that they were not noted by nurses could suggest they were either not present or not detectable at the time.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming there is an alternative explanation for the injuries or that they were not detectable, one might still be cautious in attributing their absence at the hospital to the scenario that they were not present.

The probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the new information provided.

1. **Spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death**: This implies that if Ben's death was due to natural causes (or SIDS, as an alternative explanation), spinal bleeding could be expected as part of the autopsy findings.

2. **Dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts**: This suggests that the dislocated ribs are not necessarily indicative of ante-mortem trauma caused by Jane or anyone else. Instead, they could be attributed to factors that occurred after Ben's death or during medical intervention.

Given this information and assuming Jane is not guilty (meaning she did not cause the death or injuries to Ben through actions like smothering), the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs can be explained by the provided context:

- Spinal bleeding is consistent with natural death or SIDS.
- Dislocated ribs can be attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes more plausible that the findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) are consistent with alternative explanations for Ben's death.

The probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we consider the information provided.

The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. This attribution is crucial because it provides an alternative explanation for the injuries that is not related to Jane's guilt or innocence in terms of causing harm.

If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, then the presence of these injuries can be explained by the medical interventions Andy underwent.

Given that the injuries can be attributed to resuscitation efforts, it becomes plausible that they occurred during the attempts to revive Andy.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is quite high because they can be explained by the medical context (resuscitation attempts), which is unrelated to her actions.

The probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the significance of petechiae in the context of smothering.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence is not definitive proof. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of asphyxiation caused by her.

The absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering in Ben could be seen as consistent with the hypothesis that Ben's death was not due to smothering. 

If Ben died from SIDS or another natural cause, as suggested by the alternative explanation for his death, the absence of petechiae or other signs of smothering would be expected.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is quite likely because it aligns with the scenario that his death was not due to smothering.

To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of Ben showed injuries that could be indicative of smothering or violent treatment (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). The injuries on Andy were discovered after re-examination following Ben's autopsy, suggesting potential non-accidental injury.

2. **Assessing the Injuries on Ben**: The question posits that if Jane is not guilty, how likely is it that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital? The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is crucial.

3. **Analyzing the Given Information**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause.
   - The injuries found on Ben (and later on Andy upon re-examination) are critical in determining the cause of death and Jane's guilt or innocence.

4. **Considering SIDS and the Injuries**:
   - SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death are ruled out. The presence of significant injuries makes SIDS less likely as an explanation for Ben's death.
   - If Jane is not guilty, and we are looking for an alternative explanation (like SIDS), the injuries found would need to be explained by another cause or be considered not relevant to the cause of death.

5. **The Likelihood of Injuries Not Being Present**:
   - The nurses not noting the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply that the injuries were not visible or were not present at that time.
   - However, the presence of significant internal injuries (like those described) typically suggests a traumatic event.

6. **Evaluating the Probability**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it is still a challenge to explain the injuries found on Ben, as they suggest a non-accidental cause.
   - The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon initial examination could be due to several factors, including the nature of the injuries (internal vs. external) and the timing of the examination.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries to not be present when Ben was brought to the hospital implies that they occurred afterward, which is highly unlikely and contradicts the premise that Jane (or anyone else) caused the injuries intentionally after Ben was taken to the hospital.
   - A more plausible interpretation is that the injuries were present but not noted, or they occurred very shortly before or after hospitalization.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This low probability reflects the unlikelihood that significant injuries (especially internal ones like rib and spinal cord injuries) would occur after hospitalization without being noticed or documented by medical staff, or that they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty and the deaths are considered to be due to other causes like SIDS. However, it's not zero because there are conceivable scenarios (e.g., very subtle external signs or injuries occurring right before hospitalization) where this could potentially happen.
To address the question, we must consider the scenario where Jane is not guilty and evaluate the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, such as smothering. Given this context, the injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) could be a result of other factors, such as an autopsy or post-mortem changes, or potentially misinterpreted.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is a significant piece of information. If the injuries were severe enough to be discovered during the autopsy, it's plausible that they could have been present but not noticed by the nurses, especially if they were not directly related to the immediate cause of death or if they were not externally visible.

However, the key here is understanding that some of the injuries mentioned, like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and hypoxic damage to the brain, could be indicative of certain conditions or causes of death. The fact that they were not noted by nurses suggests either they were not visible or were not significant enough at the time of hospital admission to be noted, or they occurred post-mortem.

Given that Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the deaths and injuries could be related to SIDS or another natural cause, although the described injuries do not typically align with typical SIDS characteristics. SIDS is generally not associated with significant external or internal injuries.

The likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the nature of these injuries and the medical handling of Ben's body post-mortem. Some injuries or damage (like hypoxic damage to the brain) could be a result of the events leading to death or the resuscitation efforts rather than a separate traumatic event.

If we consider that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not visible/assessed by the nurses, and assuming Jane's innocence, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being plausible, especially if we consider the possibility of post-mortem changes or the fact that some injuries might not have been immediately apparent.

However, certain injuries like those to the ribs and spinal cord are significant and might be expected to be noticed or have some clinical correlation if they were pre-mortem.

Given the information and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is relatively high, because it suggests that either the injuries are not directly related to Jane's actions or were not present at the time of hospital admission.

**80**

1. **Understanding the scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The second son, Ben, had injuries discovered during an autopsy, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

2. **The condition that the injuries were not noted by nurses**: The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not visible or were not present at that time.

3. **Implications of Jane not being guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Ben. Therefore, the injuries must have either occurred post-mortem or were not caused by her.

4. **Considering alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, one possible alternative explanation for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although the presence of injuries complicates this diagnosis for Ben.

5. **Assessing the likelihood**: Given that Jane is not guilty, the injuries on Ben must be explained by other factors. If we consider that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem (after Ben was pronounced dead), it's plausible that they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital. The fact that nurses did not note these injuries supports this possibility.

6. **Medical handling and autopsy timing**: Injuries found during an autopsy that were not noted earlier could be due to various factors, including the timing of the autopsy, handling during resuscitation attempts, or post-mortem changes.

7. **Probability judgment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, and considering that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not easily detectable, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital increases. However, the exact probability depends on various factors including the nature of the injuries and the procedures followed during hospitalization and autopsy.

Given these considerations and assuming Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries could have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital or were not immediately apparent.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider several factors. The key issue here is understanding the nature of the injuries and how they might relate to the circumstances of Ben's death and the handling of his body post-mortem.

1. **Nature of the Injuries**: The injuries found on Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of significant trauma.

2. **Medical Handling and Autopsy**: Typically, medical professionals and pathologists take great care during the handling of a deceased infant to avoid causing additional injury. The presence of such significant injuries raises questions about when they occurred.

3. **Nurses' Observation**: The fact that nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is a significant observation. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations. If the injuries were as significant as described, it would be reasonable to expect that they should have been noted unless they were not present or were not visible at the time.

4. **Post-Mortem Handling**: The possibility that the injuries occurred during the handling of Ben's body after death, either during resuscitation attempts, transportation, or during the autopsy, needs to be considered.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS, and the injuries found could potentially be the result of other factors not related to Jane's actions.

Given that the question is asking us to assume Jane is not guilty, we're being asked to evaluate the likelihood of an alternative explanation for the injuries. The injuries being due to post-mortem handling or misinterpretation are potential alternative explanations.

Given the nurses did not observe the injuries, and assuming Jane is not guilty (thus looking for explanations not involving Jane's guilt), one plausible explanation is that the injuries were not present or not observable when Ben was brought to the hospital.

To issue a probability judgment, we need to weigh the likelihood of the injuries not being present against the information given and the context.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To address the question, we need to consider the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not a result of her actions, such as smothering them. The alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of significant trauma. If these injuries were not caused by Jane (since we're assuming she's not guilty), then they must have another explanation.

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests several possibilities:
1. The injuries could have been internal and not immediately visible upon initial examination.
2. They might have been caused during the resuscitation efforts or handling by medical staff after the ambulance was called.

Given that the question asks for the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, we must consider the plausibility of the injuries being caused post-mortem or during medical intervention.

The autopsy findings indicating trauma could be consistent with aggressive resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions, which might not have been immediately apparent to the nurses. 

The probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether the injuries could be attributed to other causes such as medical intervention.

Therefore, considering the information and assuming Jane's innocence, it's plausible that the injuries could have occurred during or after hospitalization, either due to medical intervention or other factors not related to Jane's actions.

Probability judgment: 60
To assess the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information about these specific injuries.

It's stated that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. This implies that if Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS (as an alternative to being murdered by Jane), the presence of spinal bleeding could be consistent with such a scenario.

Additionally, it's mentioned that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This explanation is plausible and unrelated to Jane's actions before calling for medical help. Resuscitation attempts, which are a medical intervention, could cause such injuries.

Given that Jane is not guilty, the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or other natural causes. The presence of spinal bleeding, being common in natural deaths, aligns with this scenario. The dislocated ribs, likely caused by resuscitation attempts, also fits within the context of medical intervention following Jane's call for help.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is quite high because these findings can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt (natural death/SIDS for spinal bleeding and resuscitation attempts for dislocated ribs).

Probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the relevance of petechiae in determining the cause of death.

Petechiae are often associated with smothering or asphyxiation because they can be a sign of increased venous pressure due to the struggle to breathe. However, their presence is not definitive proof of smothering, and their absence does not necessarily rule out smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by Jane. In this scenario, the absence of petechiae or other typical injuries associated with smothering would be expected because Ben's death would be attributed to another cause, such as SIDS.

SIDS, by definition, is a sudden and unexplained death, and it does not typically present with the specific signs of trauma or asphyxiation like petechiae. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it is likely that he would not have petechiae or other signs typically associated with smothering.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming his death was due to a cause other than smothering (like SIDS), the absence of petechiae is consistent with this scenario.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and potential causes of these injuries.

The injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions, and the injuries could be explained by other factors.

Resuscitation attempts can cause certain types of injuries, especially in infants, due to the fragility of their tissues and the force sometimes applied during such procedures. The fact that Andy's injuries were initially put down to resuscitation attempts suggests that they could be consistent with medical intervention.

If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to a cause like SIDS, the presence of injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts becomes plausible. It is common for resuscitation efforts to result in some level of trauma, especially in infants.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy (attributed to resuscitation attempts) is relatively high because it provides a plausible explanation for their presence.

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided. 

The injuries found in Andy, as revealed after re-examination following Ben's autopsy, include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her. In such a case, we have to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to handling or accidental injury. However, in the context of resuscitation attempts, such bruises could also be attributed to the medical interventions.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with a significant force or trauma applied to the mouth area. It can occur during resuscitation attempts if they are vigorous.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be due to a variety of factors, including infection, congenital conditions, or trauma. In the context of a baby, it could also be related to the resuscitation efforts or an underlying condition.

Given that Andy's initial death was attributed to natural causes and considering the possibility that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts or misinterpretation becomes relevant.

SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained and not typically associated with the specific injuries found in Andy upon re-examination. However, it's crucial to understand that the presence of such injuries would not be expected in a typical SIDS case.

If we are to assume Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the injuries found could still be attributed to the resuscitation attempts, as initially thought. The key question then becomes how likely these injuries are under the assumption that they were not inflicted by Jane but could have occurred during medical intervention.

The probability judgment here hinges on whether one believes the injuries could reasonably occur during resuscitation attempts or if they strongly suggest non-accidental injury. 

Given the context that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation and that such procedures can sometimes result in injuries, it's plausible that the injuries could have occurred during these attempts.

## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben. Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, but after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy, further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts.

## Step 2: Consider the injuries found in Andy and their possible causes
The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The question now is to assess the likelihood of these injuries if Jane is not guilty, implying that the deaths could be due to other causes such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Assess the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother her children. The injuries found in Andy could still be attributed to resuscitation attempts or other accidental causes. The fact that Andy's initial death was attributed to natural causes and later found to have injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts or potentially non-natural causes complicates the assessment.

## Step 4: Evaluate the probability of the injuries occurring by chance or due to resuscitation
Given that the injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts, it's plausible that they could occur during such attempts, especially in infants where tissues are delicate. The probability that these injuries are due to resuscitation attempts rather than intentional harm is relevant.

## Step 5: Consider the context of SIDS and its relation to the injuries
SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly explain the injuries found. However, if Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts is still possible and not directly related to Jane's guilt.

## Step 6: Assess the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries could be a result of the resuscitation efforts. The key is understanding that resuscitation attempts, especially on infants, can cause certain injuries.

## Step 7: Determine the probability
The injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) could be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries might not be due to her actions but could be due to medical interventions.

## Step 8: Final assessment
Given that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that Jane is not guilty implies that the deaths and injuries might not be due to her intentional actions, we need to consider how likely it is for such injuries to occur during resuscitation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The injuries found later (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. 

2. **Understanding the Injuries**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of trauma but can also occur during resuscitation attempts or even accidentally during handling, though the latter is less likely to cause significant bruising.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it typically requires a significant force to cause such an injury, like a blow to the mouth or forced feeding/bottle feeding.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of trauma or significant stress to the infant.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts as a Cause**: The original assumption that Andy's injuries were due to resuscitation attempts is plausible for some types of injuries, especially those that could occur during vigorous or improper CPR on an infant. However, certain injuries like a torn frenulum might not be easily explained by resuscitation alone.

4. **SIDS and Associated Injuries**: SIDS by definition occurs without a clear cause after investigation. While some SIDS cases might have petechial hemorrhages (small hemorrhages that could be interpreted as 'blood in the lung' if in the context of lungs, though typically they are referred to on the surface of the lungs or other organs), they are generally not associated with significant external or internal injuries like bruises or a torn frenulum.

5. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any intentional act by her. In that case, for Andy, the injuries could be attributed to either resuscitation attempts or possibly misinterpretation of the post-mortem findings.

Given the above considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries occurred due to resuscitation attempts or are artifacts/misinterpretations is plausible for some of the injuries. However, certain injuries like a torn frenulum are more challenging to explain through resuscitation alone.

To assess the probability, let's break down the injuries and their plausible explanations:
- Some injuries could be attributed to resuscitation.
- SIDS itself does not directly cause such injuries, but the handling during resuscitation attempts might.

Given that there are explanations (like resuscitation attempts) that could account for some of the injuries found in Andy, the likelihood of these injuries occurring if Jane is not guilty is not extremely low.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's autopsy that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted, revealing injuries.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts and Injuries**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of injuries could still be explained by the resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes and that injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts supports the plausibility that the injuries occurred during attempts to revive Andy.

5. **SIDS and Injuries**: SIDS by definition is unexplained, but the presence of injuries not typical for SIDS (like bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be attributed to other factors such as resuscitation.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts (and thus not indicative of foul play) is relatively plausible because:
- The injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation efforts.
- There's an established context for resuscitation attempts having been made on Andy.

Therefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty (and thus could be due to resuscitation or other non-criminal causes) is relatively high, given the information that such injuries can be consistent with resuscitation attempts.

**65**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. This suggests that at the time, there was no clear evidence pointing towards unnatural death.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. This implies that the injuries could be a result of the medical intervention rather than an intentional act by Jane.

Given that Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in Andy need to be considered in the context of other possible explanations.

- **SIDS or Natural Causes**: If Andy's death was due to SIDS or other natural causes, the presence of certain injuries could still be explained by the resuscitation efforts made after Andy was found unresponsive.

- **Probability of Injuries Given Resuscitation**: The fact that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts provides a plausible explanation for their presence if Jane is not guilty. Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes result in injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues and bones.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy would be considered in the context of them being potentially caused by resuscitation attempts. The presence of these injuries doesn't necessarily imply guilt.

Therefore, given that Jane is not guilty and assuming the injuries could be a result of resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal factors, the probability that Andy would have such injuries is relatively plausible.

**80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Autopsy Findings for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Interpretation of Andy's Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially considered possibly due to resuscitation attempts. The torn frenulum is often cited as a potential indicator of non-accidental injury, as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also acknowledged that some injuries can occur during resuscitation efforts, although the presence of multiple types of injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) might suggest a more complex scenario.

3. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). In this case, the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means.

- **Resuscitation Attempts**: Some of Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If we consider that the injuries could be a result of vigorous resuscitation efforts, this provides an alternative explanation for the observed injuries.

- **SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: The scenario also mentions SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is diagnosed when no other cause of death is found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries in both Andy and Ben upon further examination complicates the attribution of their deaths to SIDS.

4. **Probability Judgment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, to assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries, we must consider how plausible it is that these injuries occurred without being a result of her actions. The injuries were initially thought to be due to natural causes or resuscitation. If we assume Jane is innocent, we must weigh the plausibility that the observed injuries in Andy could be due to resuscitation or other accidental means.

While resuscitation attempts can cause some injuries, the presence of multiple injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) is less typical for simple resuscitation attempts and more suggestive of a non-accidental cause. However, it's also possible that some of these could be misinterpreted or that there was a more complex scenario involving accidental injury.

Given the complexity and the fact that some injuries can be attributed to resuscitation, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries are still consistent with this scenario (e.g., due to resuscitation or other non-suspicious causes) is somewhat plausible but not highly probable due to the nature and extent of the injuries discovered.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's autopsy that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. This implies that the injuries found in Andy could plausibly be a result of the resuscitation efforts made after he was found unresponsive.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, then the death of Andy (and Ben) could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. The presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts supports the possibility that the injuries were a result of medical intervention rather than inflicted harm.

Given that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts and that Jane is presumed not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to natural causes or accidents), the likelihood of Andy having such injuries is plausible and can be linked to the efforts to save his life.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the probability that Andy would have injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high because resuscitation was attempted.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries that further investigation into Andy's death was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. 

3. **Initial Attribution of Injuries**: These injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The context suggests that such injuries could be consistent with efforts to revive Andy.

4. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or harm her children intentionally. Therefore, the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other plausible causes.

5. **Alternative Explanation - Resuscitation Attempts**: Given that the injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts, and considering Jane's innocence, it's plausible that these injuries occurred during the efforts to revive Andy. 

6. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: While SIDS is mentioned as a possible explanation for the deaths, the presence of injuries in both babies complicates this diagnosis for both Andy and Ben. However, the question focuses on the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, not directly on the cause of death.

7. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are to believe that the injuries could have occurred during resuscitation attempts, then the likelihood of these injuries having occurred during such attempts becomes relevant. The fact that they were initially attributed to resuscitation efforts suggests that this is a plausible explanation.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy could plausibly be attributed to the resuscitation attempts made on him. This suggests a relatively high likelihood of these injuries occurring under the assumption of Jane's innocence.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Resuscitation Attempts**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are consistent with the type of injuries that could occur during attempts to revive a baby. Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes cause injuries due to the vigorous nature of the procedures, including CPR.

2. **Nature of Injuries**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to handling or attempts at resuscitation.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, but it can also occur during resuscitation attempts.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of trauma or could be related to the resuscitation efforts.

3. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The background information suggests that SIDS is a possible explanation for the deaths. SIDS is by definition a sudden and unexplained death. While the injuries found in Andy and Ben are not typical of SIDS (since SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly cause specific injuries), the presence of such injuries doesn't necessarily rule out SIDS if we consider the injuries could be iatrogenic (caused by medical intervention, like resuscitation attempts).

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if we are to assume Jane's innocence.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and considering the injuries were initially thought to be due to resuscitation efforts, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with this scenario is relatively high because resuscitation attempts can indeed cause such injuries.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the injuries described. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can be due to various causes, including accidental injury or, more seriously, non-accidental injury. However, bruising can also occur during resuscitation efforts, especially if they are vigorous.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum) is often associated with a significant force or blow to the mouth. While it can be a sign of non-accidental injury, it's also possible for it to occur during vigorous resuscitation attempts, though this is less commonly reported.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This can be due to several causes, including infection, accidental injury, or non-accidental injury. Resuscitation efforts, especially if they involve vigorous or improper technique, could potentially cause injury leading to blood in the lung.

Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considering that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), we must consider how likely these injuries are to have occurred during resuscitation or as a result of other non-criminal factors.

The scenario implies that if Jane is not guilty, the injuries might have been misinterpreted or actually resulted from resuscitation efforts. 

The probability that the injuries found in Andy occurred due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal factors, given that Jane is not guilty, depends on the likelihood that such injuries can result from these causes.

While some of these injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, a torn frenulum is more typically associated with non-accidental injury. However, it's also known that resuscitation attempts can cause various injuries.

Given these considerations, we need to weigh the likelihood that the described injuries could occur during the process of attempting to revive Andy.

Likelihood: 60

To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context provided.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy results were known that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. This is crucial because Andy received resuscitation attempts after being found unresponsive.

4. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: The deaths could be attributed to SIDS, which is a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes are ruled out. The presence of injuries, however, complicates this diagnosis for both Andy and Ben.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., smothering). If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means.

- The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be attributed to the resuscitation attempts, as initially thought. 
- The likelihood of these injuries being due to resuscitation attempts is plausible because medical interventions, especially in infants, can sometimes cause such injuries due to their fragile physiology.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries found in Andy could be a result of the resuscitation attempts made after he was found unresponsive.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed suspicious injuries that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries found in Andy include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and was genuinely trying to save Andy's life during resuscitation attempts, the injuries could be a result of those efforts.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: Since the injuries can be attributed to resuscitation attempts, and there's no clear indication that these attempts were not genuine or were performed improperly by Jane, it's plausible that the injuries occurred during efforts to revive Andy.

5. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The passage mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, it does not directly relate to the likelihood of Andy's injuries being due to resuscitation.

Given the information and the context that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries occurred due to such attempts is relatively high. 

**70**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The post-mortem suggested natural causes, and it wasn't until after Ben's death and subsequent autopsy that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed injuries.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries could be a result of the resuscitation efforts made during the emergency response to Andy's condition.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are working under the assumption that the deaths were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering). The injuries found in Andy could then be attributed to other causes, such as the resuscitation attempts or possibly an accidental or natural cause that wasn't initially identified.

The likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts is plausible because medical interventions, especially in infants, can sometimes cause such injuries due to their fragile physiology.

Since we're tasked with assessing the likelihood of these injuries if Jane is not guilty, and given that the injuries could be explained by resuscitation attempts, we need to consider how plausible it is that these injuries resulted from such attempts.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the prosecution's case that the injuries were inflicted by her is weakened. Thus, alternative explanations, such as resuscitation attempts, become more relevant.

Given that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), the likelihood of the injuries being due to such attempts is relatively high because it provides an alternative explanation that is not dependent on Jane's guilt.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To determine the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the alternative explanation provided for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children, and their deaths could be attributed to other causes, potentially SIDS.

The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes of death, which could be consistent with SIDS, given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., it's considered when other causes are ruled out). The subsequent re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

If Jane is not guilty, then the presence of these injuries could be related to the attempts to revive Andy rather than an indication of smothering or other forms of abuse. The injuries found (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, as they are mentioned to be consistent with such attempts, especially in a baby.

Given that SIDS is more common among boys and has a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and without more specific information on the likelihood of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts versus other causes, we are left to infer based on the given details.

Since the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and Andy's initial death was attributed to natural causes (potentially SIDS if Jane is not guilty), the likelihood of these injuries in the context of Jane not being guilty hinges on how plausible it is that the injuries resulted from resuscitation efforts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are a result of resuscitation attempts (as initially thought), the likelihood of Andy having such injuries would be related to the probability of these injuries occurring during resuscitation attempts on a baby who potentially died of SIDS or another natural cause.

The probability judgment on a scale of 0 to 100 is: 60 

**60**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

First, let's consider the initial assessment of Andy's death and the injuries found later. Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and the injuries discovered later were thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by Jane. In this scenario, the injuries found on Andy could be attributed to other causes.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be accidental or due to handling during resuscitation attempts. Infants are fragile, and even gentle handling can sometimes result in bruising, especially if there was vigorous resuscitation.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the upper gum) can occur during a fall or due to forceful feeding or medical procedures. However, it's also a known potential injury from resuscitation attempts, although it's more commonly associated with other forms of trauma.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be a result of several factors including infection, congenital conditions, or injury. Resuscitation attempts can sometimes cause injuries that might result in blood in the lung.

Given that the initial autopsy did not highlight these injuries and they were only noted upon re-examination of autopsy photographs, it's plausible that they were either not immediately visible or were considered minor in the context of the initial cause of death assessment.

The key question is whether these injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts or other non-suspicious causes. The fact that the initial assessment attributed these injuries to resuscitation efforts suggests that they are not entirely implausible as a result of medical intervention.

However, to assess the likelihood, we must consider how probable it is that Andy's injuries were due to resuscitation or other non-suspicious causes.

The probability that Andy's injuries are due to resuscitation or other innocent causes if Jane is not guilty involves weighing the plausibility of these alternative explanations against the context provided.

Given the information that such injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts and that the initial cause of death was attributed to natural causes, it's reasonable to consider that the injuries could be explained by factors other than Jane's guilt.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are due to other causes (like resuscitation attempts or accidental injury) is relatively plausible.

**65**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context of the case.

1. **Initial Assessment of Andy's Death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed suspicious injuries that a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted.

2. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries found in Andy, upon re-examination, included bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts.

Given that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any intentional act by Jane. The alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The injuries found in Andy were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that the injuries could still be a result of genuine attempts to resuscitate Andy, or they could be coincidental or related to other non-criminal factors.

However, the presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum and bruises on the arms and legs are not typical of SIDS or resuscitation attempts alone, though they can occur during vigorous resuscitation. 

The likelihood of these injuries being present if Jane is not guilty hinges on whether these injuries can be reasonably explained by other factors, such as accidental injury or, more likely, resuscitation attempts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would depend on the plausibility that they resulted from resuscitation efforts or other non-suspicious causes.

Given the medical context and assuming the injuries could be a result of resuscitation or other non-intentional causes, the likelihood is not negligible.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information given and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Resuscitation Attempts**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries in question include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These types of injuries can be consistent with vigorous resuscitation efforts, especially in infants where bones are more pliable and tissues more delicate.

2. **Understanding the Injuries**:
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could result from handling during resuscitation attempts.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is a common injury in infants during resuscitation or even during routine care if not done gently. The frenulum is a piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum. A torn frenulum can occur if there is a significant force applied to the mouth area, which could happen during attempted resuscitation.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of trauma or possibly related to the cause of death or efforts to resuscitate.

3. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The deaths were initially considered to be possibly due to SIDS, given the age of the infants and the sudden nature of their deaths. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't necessarily preclude the possibility of some form of accidental or non-accidental injury. However, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to smothering or other non-accidental causes), and assuming the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the injuries found in Andy would need an alternative explanation.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the injuries found could still be attributed to the resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes supports this scenario. 

Given that resuscitation attempts could result in the observed injuries and that Andy's death was initially attributed to natural causes, it is plausible that the injuries occurred during attempts to revive him. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy (being due to resuscitation attempts rather than non-accidental injury) could be considered relatively high.

**90**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the information provided and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The injuries found later (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. 

2. **Resuscitation Attempts and Injuries**: It's mentioned that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to natural causes or another non-criminal explanation like SIDS, it's plausible that the injuries were a result of the resuscitation efforts.

3. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it's more common among boys. Both Andy and Ben were boys and died within a relatively short period after birth, which is unusual but not impossible for SIDS, though the likelihood decreases with the second occurrence.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found on Andy could still be attributed to the resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if we are considering Jane's innocence.

5. **Assessing Probability**: 
    - The probability of SIDS for one child is 1 in 4,000.
    - The probability of it happening twice in the same family is extremely low, as it's considered to be independent events, so it would be (1/4000)^2, making it highly unlikely.
    - However, the question is not directly asking for the likelihood of SIDS happening twice but rather the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS, the injuries found on Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be attributed to resuscitation attempts. The literature and medical practice suggest that such injuries can occur during resuscitation, especially in infants.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts (and not due to smothering or other maltreatment) would be considered relatively plausible because it aligns with the medical intervention that occurred.

**70**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided about the case.

1. **Initial Assessment and Autopsy Findings for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The injuries found later (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were not identified during the initial autopsy but were discovered after re-examination prompted by the autopsy findings on Ben.

2. **Explanation for Andy's Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. It's known that resuscitation efforts, especially in infants, can sometimes cause injuries due to the delicate nature of their tissues.

3. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of death have been ruled out. While SIDS is not fully understood and does not have a clear mechanism, it is not typically associated directly with the specific injuries found in Andy. However, if Jane is not guilty, and Andy's death is attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of certain injuries could be questioned.

Given that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found in Andy could still be consistent with resuscitation efforts, which are a plausible explanation.

The likelihood of the injuries being a result of resuscitation (and thus not indicative of Jane's guilt) hinges on the plausibility that such injuries can occur during resuscitation attempts. Medical literature and forensic pathology acknowledge that resuscitation attempts can result in injuries, though the presence of certain injuries (like a torn frenulum) might raise suspicions.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the injuries found would need to be reconciled with this scenario. The most plausible explanation within this context is that the injuries were indeed a result of the resuscitation efforts.

Therefore, considering the context that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts, and Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to such attempts (and not indicative of foul play) is relatively plausible.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the information given.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed suspicious injuries that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This subsequent examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Injuries and Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. Such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby, as the process can sometimes cause bruising or other trauma, especially if the resuscitation is vigorous or improperly performed.

3. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is considered as an alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of certain injuries, like those found in Andy and Ben, makes SIDS less likely as these injuries suggest trauma.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are assuming that the deaths were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm by her. If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means.

- **Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts, as initially thought. Medical procedures, although performed with care, can result in such injuries.

- **Other Accidental Means or Misinterpretation**: Without concrete evidence of Jane's guilt, one must consider whether the injuries could be the result of accidental means or if they were misinterpreted.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes is plausible. The fact that initial assessments attributed Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts supports this.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. The injuries found during the re-examination were initially thought to be due to resuscitation attempts. 

2. **Injuries Found**: The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are indicative of trauma.

3. **Resuscitation Attempts**: The injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, as initially thought. Resuscitation attempts on infants can sometimes cause injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones.

4. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: If Jane is not guilty, and both deaths were due to SIDS, we need to understand that SIDS is diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out, and it doesn't typically present with significant injuries like those described.

5. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy could still be attributed to vigorous resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes and that such injuries can occur during resuscitation efforts supports this.

6. **Statistical Context**: SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000), and while it's more common among boys, the presence of significant injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) makes SIDS less likely as these are not characteristic findings in SIDS.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries occurred due to resuscitation attempts or other non-SIDS, non-homicide causes needs to be considered. While the exact probability is difficult to quantify without more specific data on the frequency of such injuries during infant resuscitation, the injuries are plausible as a result of resuscitation attempts.

Given the context and the available information, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the given information and the context.

1. **Initial Assessment and Cause of Death for Andy**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, and it was only after Ben's autopsy revealed suspicious injuries that further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs was conducted. This re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

2. **Explanation for Andy's Injuries**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. It is known that resuscitation attempts, especially on infants, can result in certain injuries due to the fragility of their tissues and bones.

3. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: SIDS is considered as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical characteristics associated with SIDS.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). In this case, the injuries found in Andy need to be explained by other means. The initial explanation was that these injuries were due to resuscitation attempts, which is plausible given the context.

Given that Andy's death was initially attributed to natural causes and later the injuries were found upon re-examination of the autopsy photographs, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy's injuries occurred due to resuscitation attempts or other non-suspicious reasons becomes more plausible.

However, it's critical to understand that the presence of certain injuries (like a torn frenulum and bruises) is not typically expected from standard resuscitation attempts and are more indicative of non-accidental injury. But, it's also known that aggressive resuscitation can sometimes cause such injuries.

If we consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty and that Andy's death could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the injuries found could still be a result of resuscitation efforts, though some of the specific injuries mentioned are not typical for standard resuscitation procedures.

Therefore, assessing the likelihood involves weighing the plausibility of the injuries being a result of resuscitation or other factors against the alternative that they indicate foul play.

The injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts (though some are less typical) provides a basis to consider they could have occurred even if Jane is not guilty.

**Probability Judgment: 60**
To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given. 

Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found on Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, can be consistent with resuscitation attempts, particularly in infants. 

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Andy could be due to natural causes or SIDS, as suggested in the background. The injuries found on Andy were initially thought to be due to natural causes and resuscitation attempts. 

If Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, and not due to smothering or any other form of abuse, then the presence of injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts becomes more plausible as an explanation for the observed injuries.

Given that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes of death and that the injuries were initially put down to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, it suggests that the injuries could have occurred during the resuscitation efforts.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is relatively high because this was the initial attribution of the cause of these injuries.

The probability judgment is: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death could be attributed to natural causes or SIDS, similar to the initial assessment of Andy's death.

The injuries found on Ben, such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are significant and would typically be expected to be noticeable upon examination.

If these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital, it raises questions about when these injuries occurred and whether they could have been missed during the initial examination.

However, given the severity of the injuries found on Ben, it is generally unlikely that they would not be noticed by medical professionals, especially during the resuscitation attempts and initial examination at the hospital.

If Jane is not guilty, one possible explanation is that the injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, during the resuscitation attempts, or were not immediately apparent.

However, medical professionals are trained to look for such injuries, and it is their duty to document them. The fact that they were not noted suggests either they were not present or were not immediately obvious, but given their severity, it's more plausible they were not present or were misattributed.

The probability judgment is: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death could be attributed to natural causes or SIDS.

The information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, which supports the notion that if Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding is consistent with a natural death or SIDS.

Additionally, the dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, both of which are plausible explanations if Jane is not guilty.

Given these explanations, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes more likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben, as they can be attributed to natural causes or the circumstances surrounding his death and resuscitation attempts.

The probability judgment is: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or other forms of abuse caused by her.

Petechiae are often considered a potential indicator of asphyxiation or smothering, although their presence is not exclusive to these causes and their absence does not rule out asphyxiation.

If Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, as suggested by the assumption that Jane is not guilty, it would be expected that injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be absent.

The absence of petechiae and other typical injuries associated with smothering in Ben is consistent with the hypothesis that his death was not due to smothering.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is due to his death being caused by natural factors rather than smothering.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information: 
1. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.
2. The autopsy findings in Ben were initially thought to be indicative of smothering and/or other violent trauma.
3. Jane is charged with murdering both children by smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of violent trauma inflicted by Jane.

There are a couple of points to consider:

1. **Alternative causes for the observed injuries and conditions**: The findings in Ben (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) could potentially be attributed to other causes. For instance, hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons such as respiratory infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxia not related to smothering by another person. Similarly, haemorrhages can be caused by birth trauma, infection, or other medical conditions.

2. **SIDS as an alternative explanation**: The text mentions SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, the autopsy findings in Ben (and later found in Andy's re-examined autopsy) are not typical of SIDS, which is generally considered a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of death are ruled out. SIDS is not typically associated with significant autopsy findings like those described for Ben.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for the observed injuries. While SIDS is mentioned as a potential alternative explanation for the deaths, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy are not characteristic of SIDS. 

The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages could be due to other medical conditions or accidents. However, the detailed nature of these findings (especially when considered alongside the re-evaluated autopsy results for Andy) suggests a non-natural cause, challenging the likelihood of these being purely coincidental or due to SIDS.

To quantify the likelihood that these findings occurred if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the probability that both deaths were due to some other, non-homicidal cause. 

While it's not straightforward to assign a precise probability, the presence of significant autopsy findings in both children (upon re-examination) makes it less likely that their deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the specific autopsy findings in Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages) occurred by chance or due to another non-violent cause is relatively low, given that these findings are not typical for SIDS or many natural causes.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information states that if Jane is not guilty, another possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the pathological findings in Ben's case, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical characteristics of SIDS. SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infants, and while it is associated with certain risk factors, it does not typically present with specific pathological findings like those observed in Ben.

The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages suggests that there was some form of asphyxia or trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death was either due to SIDS or some other accidental or natural cause.

However, the autopsy findings in Ben's case (and the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs) strongly suggest that the deaths were not typical SIDS cases. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The specific findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) are more indicative of a non-SIDS cause, such as smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions like smothering), the likelihood of observing these specific pathological findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is relatively low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other natural causes. However, it's also known that some cases initially thought to be SIDS might have other underlying causes that aren't immediately apparent.

Given the specific autopsy findings, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we are left with trying to explain these findings through other means. While it's possible for infants to suffer from accidental asphyxia or other conditions that could result in similar autopsy findings, the presence of such specific and severe injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung in Andy, and hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben) makes it less likely that these are simply cases of SIDS or other non-suspicious natural causes.

Thus, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages) if Jane is not guilty hinges on the plausibility of alternative explanations that could result in such findings without implicating Jane. The described autopsy results are more characteristic of non-accidental injury than SIDS.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To address the question, let's analyze the given information and the condition that Jane is not guilty, implying that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes such as SIDS.

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is defined as the sudden, unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. It is not completely understood and is diagnosed after other possible causes of death are ruled out. SIDS is more common among boys.

2. **Findings in Ben's Autopsy**: The autopsy of Ben revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord.

3. **Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are generally indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. These findings are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

4. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of death for both Andy and Ben must be attributed to other factors. SIDS is one such possibility. However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical characteristics used to describe SIDS deaths. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death are ruled out.

5. **Likelihood of Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages if Jane is Not Guilty**: If we assume Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether the autopsy findings in Ben could be due to natural causes or other non-traumatic, non-suspicious reasons. 

The autopsy findings for Ben are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial cause rather than SIDS. While it's possible for infants to suffer from conditions that could result in hypoxic damage or hemorrhages (e.g., severe infections, congenital conditions), the specific pattern seen in Ben is not characteristic of SIDS.

6. **Evaluating the Probability**: Given that the autopsy findings are more suggestive of asphyxia or trauma, if Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider other, less likely explanations for these findings.

However, if we are to assume that Jane is innocent and thus look for alternative explanations, the probability that the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred due to natural or non-traumatic causes (other than smothering or violent trauma) is relatively low because these findings are not typical for SIDS.

Given the nature of the evidence and the details provided, it is challenging to attribute these specific findings to SIDS or another natural cause without more information on other potential causes.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. In the context of the case, these findings are associated with smothering or other forms of violent trauma.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are other plausible explanations for these autopsy findings that do not involve smothering or violent trauma inflicted by Jane.

3. **Medical Conditions or Accidents**: Certain medical conditions or accidents could potentially cause hypoxic damage and hemorrhages. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxiation could theoretically lead to similar findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more typically associated with a violent or traumatic cause.

4. **SIDS Consideration**: The question also mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While SIDS can result in some signs of hypoxia or stress, the specific pattern of injuries seen in Ben (and the re-evaluated findings in Andy) is not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are not usually associated with significant trauma or the specific autopsy findings described.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, the observed autopsy findings would need to be explained by other causes. The detailed and specific nature of the injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) makes it less likely that they are due to SIDS or an unrelated natural cause. However, without more information on potential alternative explanations (e.g., an undiagnosed medical condition, an accident), we are left to infer based on the given context.

6. **Conclusion**: The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages would be unusual in the context of SIDS or other non-traumatic causes. The likelihood of these findings occurring if Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering) hinges on the existence of an alternative plausible explanation for these specific injuries.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the likelihood of the specific autopsy findings if Jane is not guilty, we must consider how probable it is for such findings to occur naturally or due to an accident.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in infants can be indicative of asphyxia or smothering, which can cause a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and subsequent damage or death.

2. **Alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries needs to be explained by other factors. SIDS is given as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids typically would not be attributed to SIDS, as SIDS is characterized by a lack of identifiable cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

3. **Assessing the likelihood**: The specific findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical of SIDS. SIDS does not usually present with such clear signs of asphyxia or trauma. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to smothering or other violent actions by her), one would need to consider other rare or accidental causes for these specific findings (e.g., accidental asphyxia due to an unsafe sleep environment, though this is still not classified as SIDS).

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the autopsy findings are not characteristic of SIDS and imply a traumatic or asphyxial cause, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings occurred by chance or due to another non-violent, non-criminal cause is low. The presence of such specific and significant injuries suggests a significant event or cause that is not easily explained by common or known accidental or natural causes.

**Likelihood Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that the presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and potential trauma. Smothering is one cause of such hypoxia, which could lead to these symptoms. However, if Jane is not guilty, we are looking for other explanations.

The background information suggests that both deaths could potentially be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause or evidence of trauma upon autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben's case makes SIDS less likely as an explanation for his death, as SIDS is diagnosed when the death remains unexplained after thorough investigation.

However, it's crucial to understand that not all infant deaths with some pathological findings are due to smothering or violent trauma. Other factors or accidents could potentially lead to hypoxia or trauma.

If Jane is not guilty of smothering or causing violent trauma, there are a few possibilities to consider for the observed injuries and damage:

1. **Accidental or non-traumatic causes**: There could be other, non-traumatic or accidental explanations for the observed hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, though they might be rare or not directly related to SIDS.

2. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions or complications could potentially result in similar findings.

3. **Misinterpretation of autopsy results**: The interpretation of autopsy findings can sometimes be complex and subject to different opinions among experts.

However, given that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are described as consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, alternative innocent explanations would be considered less likely.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we are dealing with either a very rare or an untypical presentation of another condition or an accident that mimics smothering.

Given this context and without further detailed medical evidence or alternative explanations, the likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) being present if Jane is not guilty would be considered low, as they are more directly associated with smothering or trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia, which could be caused by violent trauma or intentional acts. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to explore other potential causes for these injuries.

1. **Natural Causes or Accidental Trauma**: The autopsy findings could be the result of other, non-intentional causes. For instance, certain medical conditions or accidents could potentially lead to hypoxic damage or hemorrhages. However, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is typically associated with asphyxia.

2. **SIDS or Other Unexplained Causes**: While SIDS is a consideration for the overall deaths of Andy and Ben, it is not typically associated with the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case, such as hypoxic damage and hemorrhages. SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out, and it doesn't usually present with significant pathological findings like those described.

3. **Misinterpretation of Autopsy Findings**: It's possible, though generally considered unlikely, that the autopsy findings were misinterpreted. Pathology is not an exact science, and different pathologists might interpret the same findings differently. However, the described injuries are generally considered to be indicative of asphyxial injury.

If Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider the possibility that the deaths and injuries were the result of either natural or accidental causes, or that there was another perpetrator, or that the autopsy findings were misinterpreted.

Given the specific pattern of injuries found in Ben, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering or causing the trauma), the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) occurring due to other causes is relatively low because these are generally indicative of asphyxia or significant trauma.

However, the presence of such findings doesn't exclusively indicate intentional smothering; they could, in theory, be the result of other, less common factors or a misinterpretation of the autopsy.

Given these considerations and the specifics of the case, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred due to other causes is low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information states that the autopsy on Ben revealed injuries consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. If Jane is not guilty, this implies that the cause of these injuries is not due to her actions. 

One alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized as a sudden and unexplainable death without clear evidence of trauma or other identifiable causes. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben's autopsy are indicative of a more complex scenario than what is typically associated with SIDS.

While SIDS can sometimes be associated with findings that might suggest hypoxia (such as intrathoracic petechiae), the specific pattern of injuries described for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths usually lack significant pathological findings, and when such findings are present, they are generally not as pronounced or specific as those described for Ben.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed injuries to Ben are due to SIDS or another non-criminal cause is low because the described autopsy findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

However, it's also possible that the injuries could be the result of an accident or another non-intentional or unintentional cause.

Given that the injuries described are indicative of some form of trauma or asphyxia, and not typical for SIDS, and assuming Jane's innocence implies an alternative explanation is needed, we still must acknowledge that these findings are unusual for a natural or accidental cause.

The probability that these specific autopsy findings occur in the context of SIDS or another non-criminal, non-intentional cause is relatively low due to their nature.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. In the context of infant death, these findings can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these findings must be attributed to other factors or causes. One possible alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism of death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

3. **SIDS and the Autopsy Findings**: The autopsy findings on Ben (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out, and it is not usually associated with specific autopsy findings like those described for Ben. Therefore, attributing Ben's death to SIDS given these findings is not consistent with the typical definition and diagnostic criteria for SIDS.

4. **Other Accidental or Natural Causes**: For Jane to be not guilty, there must be another explanation for Ben's condition. Accidental asphyxia or other natural causes could potentially lead to hypoxic damage. However, these would be unusual and not easily explained without other contextual evidence (e.g., an unsafe sleeping environment).

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: Given that the autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS and assuming Jane's innocence, we are left to consider how likely these findings are under alternative, non-criminal circumstances. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages suggests some form of asphyxia or trauma. Without evidence of Jane's guilt (e.g., smothering), one must consider whether these findings could result from an accident or a natural cause.

6. **Conclusion**: The specific autopsy findings in Ben are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of infant death. If Jane is not guilty of smothering or causing trauma, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring due to other causes (accidental or natural) is low because they are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings that are consistent with Jane's innocence. The primary alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The autopsy findings in SIDS cases are typically minimal or non-specific, and significant injuries or clear signs of trauma are not expected in cases classified as SIDS.

The findings in Ben's case include hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are indicative of asphyxia or smothering. These are not typical findings for SIDS. SIDS does not usually present with such clear signs of trauma or asphyxia. The presence of these significant pathological changes suggests that Ben's death may not be attributed to SIDS alone.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death was either due to SIDS or some other natural or accidental cause not related to her actions. However, the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not characteristic of SIDS. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring is low because they are not typical of SIDS or other natural causes that might be considered if Jane were innocent.

Probability judgment: 20 

(This reflects the low likelihood of such traumatic findings in a case of SIDS or other natural/accidental death not related to Jane's actions, but not an absolute impossibility as there could be rare or unforeseen circumstances.) 

**20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben when he died. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma or stress on the body.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering or any other violent act by her. In such a case, we are left to consider other potential causes for the observed autopsy findings.

1. **SIDS or other natural causes**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the autopsy findings need to be reconciled with these conditions. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., it's considered after other causes are ruled out), certain autopsy findings like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. However, it's known that some cases diagnosed as SIDS may have underlying factors or subtle findings that could be misinterpreted or not immediately apparent.

2. **Other medical conditions or accidents**: Other medical conditions or accidental injuries could potentially cause or mimic the findings seen in Ben's autopsy. For instance, an accidental asphyxiation or an undiagnosed medical condition leading to hypoxia could potentially cause some of the observed damage.

However, the specific combination of hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more typically associated with a violent or traumatic cause, such as smothering or shaking. If Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider whether these findings could result from another cause.

The key here is understanding that while SIDS is a possible explanation for the death of infants like Andy and Ben, the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS and suggest a more complex scenario.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider an alternative explanation like SIDS or another natural cause for Ben's death, we need to assess the likelihood of these autopsy findings occurring naturally or through an accident not related to Jane's actions.

The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages suggests an event or condition that caused significant stress or lack of oxygen. While it's possible to hypothesize alternative scenarios (like an accidental asphyxiation or a rare medical condition), the described autopsy findings are more typically associated with non-accidental injury.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to natural causes or other non-violent, non-criminal events is relatively low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information indicates that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the death of both Andy and Ben could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the specific injuries found in Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and later found in Andy's re-examined autopsy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical characteristics of SIDS. SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life without a clear cause or mechanism.

The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben strongly suggests that the infant experienced a severe lack of oxygen (hypoxia) before death, which can be caused by smothering or other forms of asphyxia. While SIDS deaths are by definition unexplained and not attributed to identifiable causes like smothering, research and pathology reports indicate that the specific findings in Ben are not characteristic of SIDS but are more indicative of a violent or asphyxial death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to natural causes or SIDS is low because these injuries are not typical of SIDS.

However, it's also crucial to consider that there could be other, less likely, natural or accidental causes for such findings, though they are not detailed in the given scenario.

Given the information and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty (implying an alternative cause for Ben's condition), the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages occurred without smothering or similar trauma is relatively low because these are indicative of asphyxia or significant trauma.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, which can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other medical conditions or accidents.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of Ben's condition could be related to a medical condition, an accident, or another unexplained cause. SIDS is sometimes considered in cases of unexpected infant death, but the presence of specific injuries (like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) makes SIDS less likely as SIDS is typically defined as an unexplained death without a clear cause after thorough investigation.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood**: 
   - The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages suggests a violent or traumatic cause, which is not typically associated with SIDS.
   - Other medical conditions or accidents could potentially cause such symptoms, but they are not specified here.
   - If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other potential perpetrators or accidental causes. However, the scenario suggests Jane was alone with both children when they were found unwell, making it less likely for another perpetrator to be involved without other evidence.

4. **Probability Judgment**: The critical question is how likely these findings are if Jane is not guilty. Given the information, if Jane is not guilty, one might infer that the injuries could be due to an accident or another cause not related to her actions. However, the specific injuries described (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are more indicative of a traumatic cause rather than an accidental or natural one.

Given the scenario and focusing on the condition of Ben, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) being due to a non-criminal cause is relatively low because these are indicative of a traumatic or violent cause. However, without more specific alternative explanations or evidence of other potential causes, we must consider the context and the information given.

The probability judgment should reflect the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring under the assumption that Jane is not guilty. 

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. The given scenario suggests that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age. While the exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, certain risk factors are associated with an increased likelihood of SIDS, such as sleeping on the stomach or side, exposure to smoke, and overheating. However, SIDS does not typically present with specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage to the brain or haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The findings in Ben's case, such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are generally associated with asphyxia or smothering rather than SIDS. SIDS is typically considered a diagnosis of exclusion, made after thorough investigation and autopsy have ruled out other causes of death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying that the deaths were not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her), the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred due to another cause or were misinterpreted is considered.

However, given the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case, it is unlikely that these would be directly attributed to SIDS, as SIDS is not typically associated with such specific traumatic or asphyxial findings. 

An alternative explanation could involve accidental asphyxia or an undetermined natural cause not related to intentional smothering. However, the described injuries are more indicative of a traumatic event rather than an unexplained natural death like SIDS.

Given this context, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider how likely these specific findings are under alternative, non-criminal explanations. Since the autopsy findings strongly suggest asphyxia or trauma, and SIDS or other natural causes are less likely to result in such specific findings, the probability that these findings occurred in the absence of Jane's guilt (and thus might be due to some other, perhaps undetermined or accidental cause) is relatively low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, which can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries must be attributed to other factors or conditions. SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of death have been ruled out, and it does not typically present with specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage or haemorrhages unless there's an underlying condition or external factor.

3. **Analyzing the Autopsy Findings in the Context of SIDS**: While SIDS is a possible cause of death in infants and is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, the presence of specific injuries (like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, and bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy upon further investigation) suggests that the deaths may not be typical SIDS cases. SIDS does not typically cause these kinds of specific traumatic or asphyxial findings.

4. **Evaluating the Probability**: Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present, there would need to be another explanation for these specific findings. While it's possible that some underlying medical condition or accidental cause could result in similar findings, the specific pattern of injuries described is more typically associated with asphyxia or trauma.

5. **Considering the Lack of Clear Alternative Explanation**: Without a clear alternative explanation that fits the observed autopsy findings (other than smothering or other violent trauma), and given that SIDS is not typically associated with such specific traumatic findings, the likelihood of these findings occurring if Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering or causing trauma) hinges on the presence of another, unidentified cause.

6. **Conclusion**: The specific autopsy findings in Ben (and the re-evaluated findings in Andy) are not typical for SIDS. If Jane is not guilty, the probability that these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are due to another cause is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other known natural causes of infant death.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings that are consistent with Jane's innocence.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, respectively. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries must be explained by other factors. One alternative explanation could be an accidental or natural cause that led to the observed medical conditions.

3. **SIDS Consideration**: The question hints at SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some SIDS cases may present with minor pathological findings, significant hypoxic damage and haemorrhages as described are not typical for SIDS. SIDS does not usually involve significant pathological findings like those described for Ben.

4. **Other Accidental Causes**: Other accidental causes could potentially lead to hypoxia or trauma. However, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more suggestive of asphyxia or smothering rather than accidental injury or natural causes not related to maltreatment.

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider how likely these specific findings are under alternative, innocent circumstances. Given that the findings are strongly associated with asphyxia or smothering, and SIDS or other accidental causes do not typically present with such significant and specific pathological changes, the likelihood of these findings under the condition that Jane is not guilty is low.

6. **Quantifying the Likelihood**: The exact probability depends on various factors, including the thoroughness of the investigation into other potential causes and the presence of any other evidence that could suggest alternative explanations. However, given the information provided and the association of the described injuries with smothering, it's reasonable to infer a low probability.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the specific hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being due to natural or accidental causes not related to smothering or maltreatment is low.

**Probability Judgment: 10**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings that are consistent with Jane's innocence. 

First, let's analyze the given information and the condition of Ben upon autopsy. The autopsy findings included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are suggested to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother or cause violent trauma to Ben. Therefore, we need to consider if there are other explanations for the observed autopsy findings.

1. **Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons, not just smothering. Other possible causes include respiratory infections, congenital conditions affecting breathing, or accidental asphyxia not related to smothering by another person.

2. **Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord**: These could be due to a variety of factors, including accidental trauma during birth or after, or other medical conditions.

However, the key issue here is whether these findings can occur in the context of SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

SIDS is, by definition, a diagnosis of exclusion, made when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of significant injuries (like those to the ribs and spinal cord) and specific pathological findings (like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) typically would not be attributed to SIDS. SIDS is considered when the death is unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The specific autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than SIDS. SIDS does not typically present with such clear signs of trauma or asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, for these autopsy findings to be consistent with her innocence, there would need to be another plausible explanation for Ben's condition that does not involve her causing harm. 

However, given the nature of the findings (especially the presence of significant trauma and asphyxial signs), it's challenging to attribute them to SIDS or an entirely natural/accidental cause without evidence of another plausible mechanism (e.g., an accident or another condition).

Considering the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, it's less likely that the specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, as these findings are indicative of traumatic or asphyxial death.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben when he was found unwell. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and potential trauma.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can result from various causes, not just smothering or violent trauma. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxia could potentially lead to similar autopsy findings.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, we need to consider other reasons for his condition. SIDS is mentioned as a potential explanation for both deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings, aside from possibly some signs of stress or minor petechial hemorrhages. The presence of significant hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not typical for SIDS.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood**: The critical question is whether the observed injuries could occur in the absence of smothering or violent trauma inflicted by Jane. While SIDS itself doesn't typically cause such significant pathological changes, other natural or accidental causes could potentially lead to similar findings.

However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more suggestive of a severe hypoxic event, potentially due to asphyxia or another cause of oxygen deprivation. If we were to consider that Jane is not guilty, we would be looking for alternative explanations that could plausibly result in these findings.

4. **Considering Natural Causes or Accidents**: There are rare natural conditions or accidental circumstances that could potentially lead to asphyxia or severe hypoxia. However, the specific combination and severity of the findings in Ben's case are not typical for most natural causes or accidents that might be considered plausible alternatives to smothering.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages occurred by chance or due to another non-violent, non-action-by-Jane cause is relatively low because these findings are strongly associated with asphyxial events.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible traumatic injury. These are serious medical conditions that can result from various causes, not solely from smothering or violent trauma.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering or causing violent trauma, there are other potential explanations for these findings. For instance, hypoxic damage could result from a range of medical conditions or accidents that lead to asphyxiation or oxygen deprivation. Similarly, haemorrhages could be due to other forms of trauma not inflicted by Jane, or even due to medical conditions or resuscitation attempts.

3. **SIDS Consideration**: The question mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some research has suggested that certain pathophysiological changes can be observed in SIDS cases, the specific findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical for a diagnosis of SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and these findings suggest a possible cause.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be explained, there must be an alternative cause. The presence of these specific pathological findings makes SIDS less likely as an explanation for Ben's death, as SIDS does not typically present with such clear evidence of hypoxia or trauma. However, it's not impossible that there could be other, natural or accidental, explanations for these findings.

5. **Probability Judgment**: Given that the findings are not typical for SIDS and suggest a possible traumatic or asphyxial cause, if Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other potential causes for these specific injuries. Without more information on alternative explanations (e.g., accidental asphyxia, other medical conditions), it's challenging to assign a precise probability.

However, the presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) makes it less likely that the death is due to SIDS or another natural cause without any foul play. The probability that these findings occur without Jane being guilty (i.e., due to another cause) would depend on the existence and likelihood of alternative explanations.

Given the information and focusing on the requirement for a probability judgment:

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

Firstly, the presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen and some form of trauma or stress that caused these hemorrhages. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother Ben or cause him other violent trauma.

One alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism for the death, and it typically does not involve significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

While some research suggests that certain pathological findings can be present in SIDS cases, the specific combination of hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more typically associated with cases of inflicted trauma or smothering. However, it's also known that some natural conditions or accidental events could potentially cause similar findings.

The critical consideration here is whether these findings could occur naturally or through accidental means without Jane's actions being the cause. 

SIDS itself is not typically associated with such significant pathological changes. However, some natural conditions (not SIDS per se) or accidents could potentially lead to similar findings.

Given that the exact cause of SIDS is unknown and it is a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., made when other causes of death have been ruled out), the presence of significant pathological changes like those described for Ben argues against a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

However, if we are considering the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, then an alternative explanation for Ben's condition must be considered. Without more detailed information on potential alternative causes (natural or accidental) that could result in the observed injuries, it's challenging to provide a precise likelihood.

Nonetheless, based on the information given, and the fact that the described injuries are more typically associated with non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes necessary to consider less common or less likely scenarios that could explain Ben's condition.

The likelihood of such findings occurring without smothering or other violent trauma (i.e., if Jane is not guilty) is relatively low because these are not typical characteristics of SIDS or most natural infant deaths.

Therefore, considering the information and typical associations, the likelihood is relatively low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids could be indicative of a condition or event other than smothering. However, according to the information provided, these findings are associated with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

SIDS is given as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not typical characteristics used to describe SIDS. Instead, SIDS is generally considered when the death is sudden and unexplained, with no evidence of significant pathological findings that would account for the death.

The specific autopsy findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are more indicative of a traumatic or violent cause rather than SIDS. 

If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present, there would need to be another explanation for these injuries. Possible alternative explanations could include accidental trauma or another form of non-SIDS, non-homicide cause. However, such findings are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

The probability that these findings occur in the absence of smothering or violent trauma (i.e., if Jane is not guilty and it was SIDS or another non-traumatic cause) is low because the described autopsy findings are not typical of SIDS.

Therefore, considering the information and the nature of the injuries described, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being due to another cause is relatively low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The autopsy findings in Ben's case, including hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of asphyxia or lack of oxygen. While these findings are consistent with smothering, they are not exclusive to it. Other possible causes of asphyxia or hypoxia in infants include accidental or non-intentional means.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to her actions (in this case, smothering). The alternative explanation given is SIDS. However, SIDS is generally not associated with significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. SIDS is typically diagnosed when the death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy, and there's no evidence of significant trauma or other cause of death.

The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages suggests that there was an event or condition that led to asphyxia or significant stress before death. While it's possible to hypothesize other rare conditions or accidents that could result in similar findings, these would be unusual and not directly related to SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the death was not due to smothering or her intentional act), the observed autopsy findings in Ben are less likely to be directly related to SIDS or other non-traumatic, non-intentional causes. However, it's also important to consider that the presence of such significant pathological findings is not typical for SIDS.

To provide a probability judgment, we must consider how likely these findings are under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering). The specific autopsy findings suggest a more complex situation than SIDS alone.

The probability that these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) would occur in the context of SIDS or another non-intentional cause is relatively low because these findings typically indicate some form of asphyxia or trauma.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben at the time of his death. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the cause of Ben's condition is not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm inflicted by her. There are several alternative explanations to consider:

1. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS):** While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not fully understood, the presence of significant autopsy findings such as hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. SIDS is generally characterized by a lack of significant findings at autopsy.

2. **Accidental Causes:** Accidental causes that could lead to hypoxia and subsequent damage include accidental suffocation or obstruction of the airway. However, the scenario provided doesn't directly suggest an accidental cause that would result in the specific injuries found in Ben.

3. **Natural Causes or Other Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions can cause or mimic the findings seen in Ben. For example, infections or congenital conditions could potentially cause some of the observed autopsy findings.

The key here is understanding that the specific findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical for SIDS. They suggest a possible traumatic or asphyxial event. If Jane is not guilty, one would need to consider other potential causes or explanations for these findings.

Given the information and focusing on the condition of Ben, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) occurred without any external or traumatic cause. However, it's also possible that these could be the result of a very rare or unusual medical condition or accident not directly related to Jane's actions.

Therefore, considering the specifics of the case and the autopsy findings, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low because they do not align with typical SIDS or common natural causes.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the implications of the doctor's statement and the context of Jane's innocence.

The doctor's statement implies that the hypoxic damage occurred relatively close to the time of death, suggesting an acute event. If Jane is not guilty, it means that she did not cause the hypoxic damage through smothering or any other intentional act.

There are a couple of scenarios to consider:

1. **Accidental or Natural Causes:** If the hypoxic damage was caused by an accidental or natural cause, it's possible that it occurred close to the time of death. For example, an acute medical condition or an accident could lead to hypoxia.

2. **Misinterpretation or Misunderstanding:** The doctor's statement is based on medical expertise, but it's also possible that there could be some variability in interpretation or that the damage could be consistent with a different timeline under certain conditions.

Given that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death depends on whether there was another plausible cause for the damage that could have occurred at that time. 

The fact that the damage was caused a matter of hours before death is more about the medical interpretation of the autopsy findings rather than directly about Jane's guilt or innocence. However, if Jane is not guilty, one might expect that the cause of the hypoxic damage, if it occurred close to death, would be due to some other factor.

The probability judgment here hinges on understanding that the timing of the hypoxic damage is a medical assessment rather than a direct reflection of Jane's guilt.

Probability judgment: 50
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

These injuries are indicative of trauma and are often associated with non-accidental injury or abuse. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause these injuries.

1. **Alternative Causes:** While it's possible that these injuries could have been caused by accidental trauma, the specific pattern (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is highly suggestive of non-accidental injury.

2. **Misinterpretation or Other Medical Conditions:** Some medical conditions could potentially cause or mimic certain aspects of these findings, but the combination of these specific injuries is highly indicative of trauma.

Given that these findings are characteristic of abuse and smothering, if Jane is not guilty, it is still necessary to consider how else these injuries could have occurred. The presence of such injuries typically points towards non-accidental trauma.

However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we must consider other potential perpetrators or explanations. If there were no other plausible explanations for these injuries, and given that Jane was the primary caregiver, it raises significant suspicion.

The likelihood of these specific injuries occurring without Jane being guilty would depend on other factors, such as the presence of other individuals who could have caused the injuries or alternative explanations for the injuries that are not related to abuse.

Probability judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the nature of these similarities and the context.

The similarities mentioned are:
1. Both babies were about the same age when they died.
2. They both died at a similar time of day.
3. They both died after just being fed.
4. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions. The similarities could be due to various factors, including coincidence, similar circumstances, or underlying conditions.

1. **Age at Death:** The fact that both babies were about the same age could be coincidental or related to a common underlying factor or vulnerability at that age.
   
2. **Time of Day and Feeding:** The similarity in the time of day and the fact that they were both recently fed could be related to the routine care of infants, as feeding times tend to be somewhat regular.

3. **Discovery by Jane:** The fact that Jane discovered both babies unconscious while alone with them is significant. While this could be seen as suspicious if Jane is guilty, if she is not guilty, it simply reflects the circumstance that she was the primary caregiver and thus more likely to be alone with the babies.

The likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance or due to other factors, if Jane is not guilty, depends on how unusual these circumstances are for infant deaths or for the care routines of infants. Some of these factors (like being the same age and being found by Jane) could be relatively likely given the context of infant care. However, the combination of these specific factors is noteworthy.

SIDS or other unexplained infant deaths could potentially occur at any time and might not necessarily follow a predictable pattern, but certain patterns (like the age and the discovery by the caregiver) could be more common simply due to the nature of infant care.

To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, and it is not typically associated with a prolonged period of illness or distress immediately before death that would result in hypoxic damage hours before death.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, as found during the autopsy, indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which could be due to various causes including smothering. If Jane is not guilty, this implies that the cause of death might not be smothering or any other form of intentional act by Jane.

However, the question is not directly about the cause of death but about the timing of the hypoxic damage. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion based on the autopsy findings.

If we consider SIDS or another natural or accidental cause for Ben's death, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death doesn't directly align with the typical understanding of SIDS, which is not usually associated with a clear period of distress or hypoxia hours before death.

However, it's also important to consider that SIDS deaths can sometimes be associated with agonal (dying) processes that could potentially include signs like hypoxic damage. The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we're exploring alternative explanations.

The crucial piece of information is that the hypoxic damage indicates some form of distress or lack of oxygen before death. If Ben died of SIDS, it's less likely that there was significant hypoxic damage hours before death because SIDS typically occurs without a clear preceding period of suffering or distress that would be expected to cause such damage.

However, medical understanding and interpretation can vary. Some infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly might have underlying conditions or agonal changes that could be misinterpreted.

To provide a probability judgment: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is considered to be due to a cause other than smothering (like SIDS), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death being consistent with this scenario is relatively low because SIDS is not typically associated with a clear period of hypoxia hours before death.

**40**
## Step 1: Understand the context and the given information about the case.
The problem involves Jane, who is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The deaths were initially investigated, with the first death attributed to natural causes and the second death leading to further investigation that implicated Jane.

## Step 2: Review the autopsy findings for both Andy and Ben.
For Ben, the autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Further investigation into Andy's death, based on autopsy photographs, found bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, suggesting potential foul play.

## Step 3: Understand the alternative explanation for the deaths - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death in infants under one year, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. It's more common among boys.

## Step 4: Consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty and evaluate the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben could be interpreted in different ways. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen, which could be due to various reasons, not necessarily smothering.

## Step 5: Evaluate the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.
SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, it is not typically associated with clear signs of hypoxic damage hours before death. However, if we consider that the deaths might not be due to smothering, we need to assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage happening naturally.

## Step 6: Assess the medical evidence and its implications.
The hypoxic damage could be a result of various factors, including but not limited to, smothering. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage would need an alternative explanation. The fact that there's hypoxic damage suggests some form of oxygen deprivation.

## Step 7: Consider the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an alternative explanation for Ben's condition. SIDS itself does not typically involve a clear timeline of hypoxia hours before death. However, some natural conditions or accidents could potentially lead to hypoxic damage.

## Step 8: Conclude on the likelihood based on the information given and the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
The prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation of the autopsy findings as evidence of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage needs an alternative explanation. The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical evidence. If we assume Jane is innocent, we have to consider whether the observed hypoxic damage could have occurred naturally or due to other non-criminal factors.

## Step 9: Make a judgment on the likelihood.
Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death would depend on whether there are plausible natural or accidental explanations for such damage. However, the specific details provided (like the injuries found) suggest a non-natural cause, making a natural occurrence of such specific damage less likely.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: While the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, research has shown that some infants who die from SIDS may have evidence of previous hypoxia or stress, suggesting that there might have been some underlying issue or episode before death. However, SIDS is not typically characterized by a single, identifiable episode of hypoxia occurring a matter of hours before death.

3. **Analyzing the Scenario**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. The findings of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain a matter of hours before death need to be considered in this context.

4. **Interpreting Hypoxic Damage**: The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain indicates that Ben experienced a period of reduced oxygen availability before death. While this could be interpreted as evidence of a traumatic event (such as smothering), it's also possible that it could result from other causes, including severe illness or an unexplained event that could be related to SIDS.

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death by chance or as part of the SIDS event is uncertain. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made after thorough investigation rules out other causes. The presence of hypoxic damage is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis but doesn't entirely rule it out either, as the pathophysiology of SIDS is not fully understood.

6. **Conclusion**: The presence of hypoxic damage does suggest that there was some issue before Ben's death. However, attributing this to SIDS or another natural cause if Jane is not guilty involves a degree of uncertainty. The fact that there's hypoxic damage could indicate a potential issue, but SIDS cases can sometimes show signs of stress or previous hypoxia, though the timing (a matter of hours before death) is specific and not typically associated with the usual understanding of SIDS.

Given the uncertainty and the specifics of the case, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death by a natural cause or SIDS is difficult to quantify directly from the information given. However, it's generally considered that specific, timed hypoxic damage might not be characteristic of typical SIDS cases.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the alternative explanation provided - that the deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children, and their deaths could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS.

1. **Understanding SIDS and its Implications**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The exact cause or mechanism is not known. However, it is known that SIDS can sometimes be associated with certain risk factors, though these do not necessarily cause it.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) can occur in various scenarios, including SIDS. In the context of SIDS, it's plausible that some form of hypoxia or oxygen deprivation could be related to the death, though the exact timing and cause might be unclear.

3. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The statement that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is a specific claim that needs to be evaluated in the context of SIDS. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the timing and nature of any hypoxic damage could be variable and not necessarily indicative of a specific time frame before death.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not directly related to Jane's actions (since she's not guilty). The question then becomes whether SIDS or another natural cause could result in hypoxic damage close to the time of death.

SIDS deaths can sometimes show signs that could be interpreted as hypoxic damage, but the timing and cause are not typically determinable with precision in the context of SIDS. If Ben died of SIDS, it is possible that any observed hypoxic damage could be related to the death process, potentially occurring close to the time of death.

Given the scenario and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), it is plausible that the hypoxic damage could have occurred as part of the process leading to Ben's death.

Therefore, considering the lack of direct evidence linking the timing of hypoxic damage to Jane's actions and assuming SIDS or a similar natural cause for Ben's death, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is reasonably plausible.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of both children, which were interpreted as indicative of smothering or violent acts.

2. **Considering the Alternative Explanation (SIDS)**: The defense or an alternative explanation might suggest that the deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, typically during their first year, without a clear cause.

3. **Assessing the Hypoxic Damage to Ben's Brain**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The prosecution's expert suggested this damage occurred a matter of hours before death.

4. **Implication of Hypoxic Damage Timing**: If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the timing and nature of the hypoxic damage need to be considered in the context of SIDS or an alternative natural cause.

5. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The condition leading to death in SIDS cases is not typically associated with a clear timeline of hypoxic damage hours before death. SIDS is more about an unexpected death without a clear cause upon autopsy.

6. **Analyzing the Statement**: If Jane is not guilty, implying the death could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, then the specific timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) as alleged might not be directly relevant or expected in the context of SIDS.

7. **Assessing Likelihood**: The likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death, assuming Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether such a scenario is plausible under the alternative explanation (e.g., SIDS). 

8. **SIDS and the Autopsy Findings**: The presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries (like bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung for Andy) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion; it is considered when other causes are ruled out.

9. **Interpretation**: If we are considering Jane not being guilty, we are essentially considering that the deaths might not be due to smothering or any form of intentional act by Jane. However, the presence of specific injuries (hypoxic damage, bruises, torn frenulum) is not characteristic of SIDS but rather indicative of possible trauma or other non-SIDS conditions.

Given the specific autopsy findings for both Andy and Ben, which suggest trauma or violence (and thus not typical SIDS cases), if Jane is not guilty, it challenges the direct link between the alleged act (smothering) and the observed injuries. However, it does not directly validate or invalidate the timing of the hypoxic damage.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and considering an alternative explanation like SIDS, is not directly supported because the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of Ben, which included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, this suggests that he experienced a period of oxygen deprivation before his death.

3. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her. An alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

4. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. While the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, it is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage or other specific pathologies that would be expected to occur hours before death. However, some research suggests that some infants who die from SIDS may have experienced some level of hypoxia or other stressors before death, though this is still a subject of research and debate.

5. **Interpreting the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage might still be explained by a pathological process or an accidental cause that led to oxygen deprivation. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) as suggested by the doctor, is what needs scrutiny.

6. **Assessing Likelihood**: 
   - If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, it is challenging to directly link the hypoxic damage to a specific timing (hours before death) without a clear cause.
   - However, some natural causes or accidental events (e.g., accidental asphyxia, though this is a controversial topic and can be difficult to distinguish from intentional smothering) could potentially lead to hypoxic damage before death.

7. **Conclusion**: 
Given that Jane is not guilty, attributing the cause of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain to a matter of hours before death involves understanding that SIDS or other natural causes are not typically characterized by clear evidence of such damage occurring hours prior to death. If we are to believe Jane is innocent and the death was due to SIDS or a similar cause, the specific claim about the timing of the hypoxic damage (hours before death) becomes less likely to be directly related to the events leading to death if those events were natural or accidental and not due to smothering.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age that doesn't have a known cause after a complete investigation, including an autopsy. The given frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS, it's plausible that some form of hypoxia occurred. However, SIDS is characterized by its unexpected nature and lack of clear cause.

3. **Interpreting the Autopsy Findings**: The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the subsequent findings in Andy's re-examined autopsy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), were used to suggest that the deaths were not natural but caused by smothering. 

4. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the specific autopsy findings (like hypoxic damage to the brain) suggest that there was some form of distress or issue before death.

5. **Likelihood of Hypoxic Damage Hours Before Death in SIDS**: SIDS deaths are typically unexpected and without a clear preceding illness or condition that would suggest significant hypoxic damage hours before death. However, some research suggests that some infants who die of SIDS may have subtle or mild underlying vulnerabilities or agonal (immediately before death) changes.

6. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, and we consider SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typically characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is more associated with an acute event without clear preceding significant hypoxia.

7. **Evaluating the Doctor's Statement**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline for the injury. If Jane is not guilty, this statement's accuracy depends on whether SIDS or a similar condition could result in such damage.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or a similar unexplained natural cause, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a result of a natural cause like SIDS, as SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexpected nature. The presence of significant hypoxic damage hours before death may suggest a different or more complex scenario than typical SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons by smothering them. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of both children, which were initially attributed to different causes.

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy revealed injuries including hypoxic damage to the brain, among other signs. The prosecution alleges that these injuries were caused by smothering.

3. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by Jane.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The text mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism for the death.

5. **Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS or Natural Causes**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could still be consistent with these conditions if they led to a cessation or significant reduction in breathing, thereby causing hypoxia.

6. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The allegation is that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. If Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, it's plausible that the process leading to death (and thus hypoxic damage) occurred close to the time of death, as SIDS is by definition an unexpected death without a clear cause.

7. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage relative to death becomes a matter of understanding the natural progression of such conditions. SIDS can occur suddenly, and it's conceivable that the process leading to death (including hypoxia) could occur shortly before death.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, it is plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred relatively close to the time of death. This is because sudden infant deaths can be associated with an acute event or process that could result in hypoxic damage shortly before death.

**Probability Judgment: 80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context provided and the alternative explanation given - that the deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. It typically occurs in infants under one year of age. The exact cause or mechanism is unknown, but there are identified risk factors.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: SIDS infants often show signs of hypoxia or lack of oxygen. It's plausible that in some SIDS cases, there could be some level of hypoxic damage due to the nature of the death, although the exact timing and mechanism might not be clear.

3. **The Specifics of Ben's Case**: The autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, were significant enough to suggest to the medical examiner that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death. However, if Jane is not guilty, and the death is attributed to SIDS, we must consider whether SIDS could potentially cause similar findings.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: 
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death, and potentially Andy's, could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause.
   - SIDS is associated with various pathological findings, including signs of hypoxia. However, the specific timing of when such hypoxia occurred (e.g., hours before death) is not typically a defining characteristic used to diagnose SIDS.
   - The presence of hypoxic damage does not necessarily contradict a SIDS diagnosis entirely since SIDS deaths are often associated with some form of hypoxia or asphyxia, though the exact cause is unknown.

5. **Interpreting the Hypoxic Damage Timing**: 
   - The assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" is a specific interpretation based on the autopsy findings.
   - If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the relevance or accuracy of this timing becomes less clear because SIDS, by definition, involves an unexplained death, potentially with agonal or pre-terminal changes that might not be precisely timed in the same way as in cases of clear asphyxia or smothering.

Given the scenario where Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death could be attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as alleged might be less relevant or could be seen as less certain. 

The autopsy findings and their interpretation might not align perfectly with a SIDS diagnosis if they imply a specific timing that suggests a more acute event. However, SIDS cases can present with a variety of pathological changes, and some could potentially be consistent with hypoxic damage.

Therefore, considering Jane is not guilty, and attributing Ben's death to SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as specifically interpreted by the doctor is **less certain** but not necessarily impossible.

**PROBABILITY JUDGMENT: 40**
## Step 1: Understand the given scenario
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the allegation that she smothered them. The deaths were initially investigated, and the second child's autopsy revealed injuries suggesting possible smothering or abuse.

## Step 2: Analyze the information given about the deaths
The first son, Andy, died at 11 weeks, and the post-mortem suggested natural causes. The second son, Ben, died at 8 weeks, and his autopsy showed signs of injuries. Further investigation into Andy's death using autopsy photographs revealed potential signs of abuse.

## Step 3: Understand the alternative explanation for the deaths
The alternative explanation given for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a sudden and unexplained death of infants during their first year. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 4: Consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

## Step 5: Evaluate the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could have occurred due to a natural cause or an accident rather than smothering by Jane. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries (like injuries to the ribs and spinal cord) in Ben suggests a possible non-natural cause. The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we are looking at alternative explanations for Ben's condition.

## Step 6: Assess the given medical evidence in the context of Jane's innocence
The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely it is that such damage occurred naturally or accidentally a matter of hours before Ben's death.

## Step 7: Relate the medical evidence to possible causes
Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or accidental death, it's less clear how this would occur "a matter of hours before death" unless it was part of a terminal event or a severe, unnoticed illness. SIDS is characterized by its suddenness and lack of explanation, not typically by a gradual decline indicated by hypoxic damage hours before death.

## Step 8: Consider the probability in the context of Jane's innocence
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural/accidental cause, the specific timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) being related to the cause of death is not directly supported by the typical understanding of SIDS, which is sudden and unexpected.

## Step 9: Evaluate the probability
Given that SIDS is sudden and unexplained, the presence of hypoxic damage "a matter of hours before death" might not typically align with the expected profile of SIDS, as SIDS is not usually preceded by noticeable hypoxic damage hours before. However, the condition of Ben suggests a severe event or condition leading to death.

## Step 10: Conclude on the likelihood
The allegation that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death, if Jane is not guilty, challenges the SIDS explanation because it implies a period of distress or illness before death, which is not characteristic of SIDS. However, it's not entirely impossible for an infant to experience hypoxia before death from a natural cause.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for the observed injuries and the death.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to another cause, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes are ruled out.

However, the question is not directly about whether the deaths were SIDS, but rather the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider alternative explanations, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is a medical fact that can be assessed independently of Jane's guilt or innocence.

The key issue here is understanding that the hypoxic damage's timing is a factual observation based on medical evidence. If the medical evidence indicates that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, this is a separate issue from Jane's guilt or innocence. The medical evidence suggesting the timing of the hypoxic damage is not directly influenced by whether Jane is guilty or not; it's based on the pathological findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence but to the medical interpretation of the evidence.

Given the medical evidence is presented as a fact ("the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death"), and assuming this evidence is reliable, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death would be considered high, regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence.

Thus, the probability judgment on the likelihood that the statement about the timing of the hypoxic damage is true, if Jane is not guilty, should reflect the reliability of the medical evidence.

**90**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and available information.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, and there's no clear evidence or mechanism that links SIDS directly to the hypoxic damage observed in Ben.

The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries and the cause of death might not be due to smothering or any intentional act by Jane. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben, and the re-examination findings in Andy's autopsy photographs, complicate the picture.

The key question is whether the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could have occurred a matter of hours before death under circumstances that do not imply Jane's guilt. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which can occur due to various reasons, not solely due to smothering.

If we consider alternative explanations for Ben's death, such as SIDS, it's crucial to note that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered after other causes of death are ruled out. The presence of significant autopsy findings like hypoxic brain damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, and hemorrhages in Ben strongly suggests that his death was not simply SIDS but was due to a specific cause that led to these findings.

However, the question is about the timing of the hypoxic damage relative to Ben's death, not directly about the cause. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation for the death, the hypoxic damage could still have occurred due to an accidental or natural cause that happened shortly before death.

The prosecution's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" is based on medical expertise. If Jane is not guilty, the critical factor is whether there's an alternative plausible explanation for the observed hypoxic damage that is consistent with an innocent scenario.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to assess the plausibility of this timing in the context of an alternative cause of death.

The doctor's statement suggests a specific timing based on medical evaluation. If Jane is innocent, the cause of the hypoxic damage could be unrelated to her actions. However, the presence of significant injuries and the specific finding of hypoxic brain damage still needs an explanation.

To directly answer the question without making assumptions beyond the given information, we must consider that the medical evidence (hypoxic damage to the brain) is a factual observation, not directly a statement of guilt or innocence.

Therefore, assessing the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death involves understanding that this is a medical assessment that can be made regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty, hinges on the medical interpretation of the evidence. The doctor's testimony suggests that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death, which is a medical judgment.

Thus, if we are to assess the probability based on the given condition (Jane is not guilty), and knowing the doctor's allegation is based on medical evidence, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is not directly influenced by Jane's guilt or innocence but by the medical interpretation of the evidence.

Therefore, the probability judgment is **80**.
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and implications of the given information.

1. **Understanding the Case Against Jane and the Alternative Explanation (SIDS):** Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The alternative explanation for their deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The prosecution's case against Jane for Ben's death partly relies on the autopsy findings indicating hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing:** The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain is a critical piece of evidence. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor alleged that this damage must have occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty:** If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature.

4. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS or Natural Causes:** If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could be questioned as to its timing and cause. SIDS is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death, as it is generally understood to occur suddenly and without warning signs.

5. **Considering Alternative Explanations for Hypoxic Damage:** If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS, the hypoxic damage's alleged timing (a matter of hours before death) might not directly correlate with the typical understanding of SIDS, which does not usually involve a prolonged period of hypoxia before death. However, it's also possible that certain conditions leading to SIDS or other natural causes could result in hypoxic damage.

6. **Likelihood Assessment:** If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or a similar condition as the cause of death, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as alleged might be considered less likely because SIDS is typically sudden. However, the exact mechanism of SIDS is not fully understood, and there might be variability in how it presents.

7. **Conclusion:** The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is not directly related to her guilt or innocence but rather to the underlying cause of Ben's death. If we assume Jane's innocence and attribute Ben's death to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage as "a matter of hours before death" may not be strongly supported by the typical characteristics of SIDS.

Given the complexity and the need to assess the probability based on the given scenario and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, it is challenging to directly correlate the timing of hypoxic damage with SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons by smothering them. The prosecution's case against her partly relies on the autopsy findings of both children, which suggested injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, this indicates that at some point before his death, he experienced a period of low oxygen levels, which damaged his brain.

3. **The Prosecution's Interpretation**: The prosecution alleges that the hypoxic damage was caused by smothering, implying an action by Jane that led to this condition.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, then an alternative explanation for the deaths, including the hypoxic damage, needs to be considered. SIDS is proposed as a possible explanation for both deaths.

5. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While it is associated with certain risk factors, its cause remains unknown. Some research suggests that SIDS may be related to underlying vulnerabilities in the infant, possibly related to brainstem abnormalities that affect arousal and cardiorespiratory control.

6. **Hypoxic Damage and SIDS**: The presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as contradictory to a straightforward SIDS diagnosis since SIDS is, by definition, unexplained. However, it's conceivable that some underlying condition or episode that contributed to or was part of the pathway to SIDS could result in hypoxic damage.

7. **Assessing the Timing**: The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical interpretation. If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or another natural cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a critical issue. SIDS is typically associated with a previously healthy infant. The presence of significant hypoxic damage hours before death might suggest an ongoing pathological process rather than an acute event like smothering.

8. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, implying the deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death being directly related to her actions is not applicable. However, the question seems to be probing the plausibility of the hypoxic damage happening hours before death under a non-criminal scenario.

Given the information and the requirement to assess the likelihood under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus considering SIDS or a similar unexplained cause), we are left to infer that the hypoxic damage could be part of the pathological process leading to death. However, SIDS is typically sudden and unexpected, not necessarily preceded by hours of hypoxic damage.

Therefore, considering SIDS or a similar condition as the cause of death, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, as a natural occurrence or part of the SIDS pathway, is plausible but not the typical presentation of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively).

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other signs. The prosecution's expert witness suggested that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death.

3. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by her.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The alternative explanation given for the deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death in infancy, and it is more common among boys.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we consider the possibility that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, we need to understand that SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and other injuries could be seen as contradicting a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is typically diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

6. **Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The critical point here is the timing and cause of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain. If Jane is innocent, and the death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage doesn't directly support or refute Jane's guilt or innocence directly. However, the allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death being related to the cause of death is plausible in a scenario where the death was not due to smothering.

7. **Evaluating the Evidence**: The doctor's statement implies a causal link between the hypoxic damage and the events leading to Ben's death. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we must consider whether the hypoxic damage could have occurred naturally or as part of the process leading to death from another cause.

8. **Conclusion**: The occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death could be related to the dying process rather than being a definitive indicator of smothering. In cases of SIDS or other natural deaths, there can be various pathological changes, but the specific timing of hypoxic damage can be difficult to ascertain without clear context.

Given Jane's innocence and considering an alternative cause of death like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death could still be plausible as it might be related to the agonal process (the process of dying). However, the presence of other injuries complicates a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

Therefore, considering the complexities and the fact that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the likelihood is still quite plausible if we consider that the damage could be part of the dying process or related to the events surrounding the death, regardless of the cause.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the context**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben showed hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

2. **Hypoxic damage and its timing**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of infant death, this could be due to various reasons, including smothering, but also potentially other medical or accidental causes.

3. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben are not due to smothering or any form of intentional act by Jane. The hypoxic damage found in Ben could be due to a different cause. 

4. **Alternative explanations**: SIDS is mentioned as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, and typically, infants who die from SIDS do not have the significant pathological findings seen in Ben (like hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids).

5. **Analyzing the given information**: The presence of significant injuries in Ben (and upon re-examination, in Andy as well) suggests that their deaths might not be typical SIDS cases. However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and thus consider alternative explanations, we need to think about the likelihood of these findings occurring naturally or accidentally.

6. **Considering the timing of hypoxic damage**: The allegation is that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. If Ben's death was due to a natural cause or an accident not related to Jane's actions, the timing of the hypoxic damage would be coincidental with the events leading to his death.

Given that the significant pathological findings in Ben are not typical for SIDS and suggest some form of traumatic or asphyxial event, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that there must be another explanation for these findings. However, the specifics of the alternative cause are not detailed in the given scenario.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to a cause unrelated to Jane's guilt (i.e., Jane is not guilty) is complex to assess directly from the given information. However, the fact that significant pathological findings were present makes the scenario less likely to be a simple SIDS case.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to some other cause, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death depends on the nature of that other cause. 

Given the provided context, it's challenging to directly associate the timing of hypoxic damage with Jane's innocence without making assumptions about the alternative cause of death. However, if we consider that the prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation of the autopsy findings as indicative of smothering, and if Jane is not guilty, we need an alternative explanation that could also account for the hypoxic damage.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben showed hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen before he died.

3. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, then the death of Ben (and Andy) is attributed to another cause, potentially SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

4. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death in infants. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the hypoxic damage observed could be part of the process leading to his death. However, SIDS is characterized by its lack of clear cause or explanation.

5. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: The presence of hypoxic damage indicates some form of oxygen deprivation. If Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the hypoxic damage might still be present but would need to be explained within the context of that cause.

6. **Considering the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or a similar natural cause for Ben's death, the critical question is whether the observed hypoxic damage could be consistent with a natural cause of death.

The key information here is that if Jane is not guilty, Ben's death, along with Andy's, is likely attributed to SIDS or a similar cause. The specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is a medical assessment. 

In cases of SIDS, the death is sudden and often unexpected, and there may be some debate about whether the condition leading to death developed shortly before death or whether the observed damage (like hypoxic damage) is consistent with the syndrome.

However, the presence of hypoxic damage does not directly imply a violent or unnatural cause like smothering; it simply indicates a lack of oxygen. If we are to consider that Jane is not guilty and thus consider SIDS or a similar natural cause, we must assess if the timing of the hypoxic damage (hours before death) is plausible in such a context.

The literature and medical understanding around SIDS do not typically characterize the timing of hypoxic damage in the same way they would for a traumatic or violent cause. SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained, and the pathological findings can be non-specific.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is still subject to medical interpretation. However, it is a given in the scenario that the doctor alleged it happened a matter of hours before death.

**Given the condition that Jane is not guilty and without more detailed medical evidence or expert testimony to directly correlate hypoxic damage timing with SIDS or a similar cause, we are somewhat constrained in our assessment.**

To directly assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage timing under the condition of Jane's innocence (and thus potentially SIDS or a similar natural cause), we need to rely on the medical evidence and its interpretation.

The doctor's allegation already states that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, this fact doesn't directly change; it's a medical finding. Thus, the likelihood we're assessing isn't directly about whether the damage happened (since the doctor alleges it did), but rather if it's plausible under a different cause of death.

**Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and we're considering a different, potentially natural cause for Ben's death, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is effectively the probability that the doctor's medical assessment is correct, regardless of the cause of death.**

The final judgment is based on the given medical assessment. Hence, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is still based on the assumption that the doctor's allegation is factually correct.

**50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and possible explanations for the observed conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. The autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of a traumatic event or asphyxiation. However, if we are to consider the scenario where Jane is not guilty, we must explore alternative explanations for these findings.

The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain suggests a period of oxygen deprivation. If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation could be that the hypoxic damage occurred due to a natural or accidental cause rather than a deliberate act by Jane.

However, the specific timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred (a matter of hours before death) is crucial. The prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation that the injuries and hypoxic damage were caused by Jane's actions, suggesting a short timeframe between the infliction of the injury and death.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death would need an alternative explanation. SIDS is defined by the lack of a clear cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some cases attributed to SIDS might involve underlying vulnerabilities or accidental factors, the condition itself is characterized by its unexplained nature.

The detailed autopsy findings for Ben (and the re-examination findings for Andy) suggest that their deaths might not be typical of SIDS, as they involve specific pathological changes. However, the possibility of an underlying condition or an accidental cause leading to hypoxia cannot be entirely ruled out without further evidence.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation for the deaths, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to natural or accidental causes is plausible but highly speculative without more specific evidence supporting such a scenario.

However, the court case revolves around whether Jane's actions caused the deaths. If Jane is not guilty, and we consider SIDS or another natural cause, the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage might not directly relate to Jane's actions.

The probability judgment is **20**.
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year of age that doesn't have a known cause. The deaths often occur during sleep. Various risk factors have been identified, but the exact cause or mechanism remains unknown.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Infants who die from SIDS may have signs of hypoxia or other pathological changes, but these are not necessarily indicative of a specific cause or timing of the insult leading to death. The pathophysiology of SIDS is complex and may involve a combination of factors such as brain abnormalities, issues with the infant's ability to arouse from sleep, and environmental factors.

3. **Interpreting Hypoxic Damage**: The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates that at some point, Ben experienced a lack of sufficient oxygen. In a non-SIDS death, this could be due to various causes, including smothering or another form of asphyxia. However, in the context of SIDS, it's possible that the hypoxic damage could be part of the terminal event or a process leading up to the death.

4. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timing for the insult. If Jane is not guilty, and the death is attributed to SIDS, the timing and cause of the hypoxic damage need to be considered in the context of the natural history of SIDS.

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is due to SIDS, the hypoxic damage could be part of the pathophysiological changes occurring around the time of death. SIDS is not fully understood and can involve agonal or pre-terminal changes that might include hypoxia. Therefore, it's plausible that the hypoxic damage could be related to the events leading to or surrounding the death, regardless of the exact timing.

Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming Ben's death is due to SIDS, the doctor's allegation about the timing of the hypoxic damage might not necessarily be inconsistent with a natural death. However, SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage are generally considered in the context of other evidence.

**The likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty (and thus assuming SIDS or another natural cause), depends on understanding that SIDS deaths can involve agonal changes that might include hypoxia. The exact timing (hours before death) as an allegation might be less directly linked to the guilt or innocence regarding the act of smothering but is relevant to understanding the death's circumstances.**

Probability judgment: 50
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation for Ben's death, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and whether these findings are consistent with SIDS.

1. **SIDS and Pathological Findings**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when all other causes of death have been ruled out. While certain pathological findings like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages can be seen in SIDS cases, they are not typically characteristic or diagnostic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally unexpected and unexplained.

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Hemorrhages in SIDS**: Some infants who die from SIDS may have signs of hypoxia or other pathological changes. However, significant hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not typically associated with SIDS. The presence of such findings might suggest another cause or contributing factor.

3. **Interpreting the Findings**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben died from SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage could potentially be part of the agonal changes or the terminal event. However, the presence of hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is less typical for SIDS and might suggest an alternative explanation.

4. **Likelihood**: The combination of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is more suggestive of a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than SIDS. If Jane is not guilty, implying that Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific findings is less likely because they do not typically characterize SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing both hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is lower because these findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these findings can be explained by alternative causes or if they are necessarily indicative of abuse or smothering.

1. **Interpretation of Findings**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of trauma or abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often associated with a significant impact to the mouth area, and blood in the lung can result from various forms of trauma or asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: While these findings can be associated with abuse, it's also important to consider whether there could be alternative explanations for these injuries that do not involve intentional harm by Jane. For example, accidental trauma or certain medical conditions could potentially cause some of these findings, although they are less likely to account for the combination of these specific injuries.

3. **SIDS vs. Trauma**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically involve significant traumatic injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. The presence of these findings is not characteristic of SIDS.

4. **Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, implying that Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these traumatic injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) is unlikely because they do not align with the typical profile of SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing these specific traumatic findings in Andy is low because they are indicative of trauma or abuse rather than SIDS.

Probability judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the similarities.

1. **SIDS and Similarities**: Both deaths being attributed to SIDS (if Jane is not guilty) means we are dealing with two unexplained deaths in infancy. SIDS is known to occur more frequently in certain age ranges and can happen at any time.

2. **Age Similarity**: The fact that both babies were about the same age when they died could be coincidental, as SIDS can cluster within a certain age range (typically within the first year, with a peak around 2-4 months).

3. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: The similarity in the time of day and the circumstance that both babies were found unconscious after being fed and when Jane was alone with them could be seen as coincidental. SIDS can occur at any time and under various circumstances.

4. **Assessing Likelihood of Similarities**: The likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance, given that both deaths are due to SIDS, involves considering how common these circumstances are in SIDS cases. While SIDS deaths can share some similarities (e.g., age), the specific constellation of similarities here (age, time of day, being found after feeding) is noteworthy.

However, given that SIDS is an unexplained phenomenon and can occur under a variety of circumstances, the occurrence of some similarities between two incidents could be seen as possible, though perhaps not highly probable.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that attributing these specific and multiple similarities solely to coincidence stretches credibility. However, in the absence of a direct causal link (such as guilt), one must consider the possibility, albeit potentially low.

To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the circumstances and the potential explanations for these similarities.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies died at approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is known to occur most frequently between 1-4 months of age. Thus, it's plausible that both deaths occurring within this age range could be coincidental if they were due to SIDS or another natural cause.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both babies died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. The timing and circumstances could be coincidental, especially if we consider that both infants were very young and dependent on Jane for care.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: The fact that Jane discovered both babies is not surprising given that she was their primary caregiver. The fact that she was alone with them when they were found could be due to the nature of infant care, where caregivers often attend to babies alone.

If Jane is not guilty, the similarities in the circumstances could be attributed to a combination of the natural vulnerabilities of infants at similar ages, the routine care practices (e.g., feeding times), and the fact that Jane was the primary caregiver. 

SIDS, though unexplained, has a known higher incidence in certain conditions and among certain populations (e.g., more common in boys, as mentioned). The fact that both deaths might be attributed to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause could explain some of the similarities due to the natural history of such conditions.

The probability of these specific similarities occurring under the assumption that Jane is not guilty involves assessing the likelihood that two unexplained infant deaths in the same family could share these characteristics by chance or due to shared underlying factors (such as genetic predisposition or environmental factors).

While calculating an exact probability is challenging without precise data on the distribution of these specific circumstances among SIDS or other unexplained infant deaths, we can consider that the combination of factors (age, time of day, discovery by Jane) could be relatively rare but not impossible.

The key issue here is not just the probability of SIDS or another natural cause but also the conditional probability of observing these specific similarities if Jane is innocent.

Given these considerations and in the absence of a clear mechanism linking the deaths other than the caregiver and the age of the infants, one might argue that while the similarities are striking, they are not entirely implausible under the assumption of innocence, especially if one considers that many aspects of infant care and the vulnerabilities of infants at certain ages could lead to similarities in the circumstances of their deaths.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential explanations for these similarities.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is known to occur typically within the first year of life, with a peak incidence around 2-4 months. Thus, the ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths are within the range where SIDS can occur, although they are on the lower end. The similarity in age could be coincidental or related to an underlying risk factor common to both infants.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is not specifically linked to feeding times, though it's sometimes associated with sleeping. The fact that both incidents happened after feeding and when Jane was alone could be coincidental, as SIDS deaths are unpredictable and can occur under various circumstances.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: Jane discovered both babies unconscious. This is a factor that could be influenced by Jane being the primary caregiver and thus more likely to be the one to discover the babies unresponsive.

If Jane is not guilty, the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. The probability of the similarities occurring under the assumption of innocence (i.e., SIDS or another natural cause) hinges on the likelihood of SIDS or other natural causes occurring under similar circumstances.

The circumstantial similarities (age, time of day relative to feeding, and being discovered by Jane) could occur by chance, especially if both deaths were SIDS or due to a similar natural cause. The key is understanding that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of death without clear evidence.

To quantify the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these events happening independently.

- The age similarity is plausible given both were infants.
- The timing relative to feeding and being found by Jane could be seen as coincidental given she was their caregiver.

However, quantifying this exactly is challenging without specific data on the distribution of these factors in SIDS cases. SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000), and the specific circumstances (e.g., age, timing relative to feeding) can vary widely.

The probability that two SIDS deaths occur in the same family is extremely low, but the additional factor here is the similarity in circumstances. While each SIDS death is an independent event in terms of cause, the fact that they share certain contextual similarities (discovered by Jane, around the same age) could be seen as more likely if we consider the context of a familial setting where routines and caregiving patterns are consistent.

Given these considerations and without precise statistical data to directly inform the calculation, it's a complex task to assign an exact numerical probability. However, the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare (the probability would be roughly the square of the probability of a single SIDS death, or (1/4000)^2), and the additional similarity in circumstances (age, time relative to feeding, discovered by the same person) adds a layer of complexity.

The probability judgment for the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty involves considering the improbability of two SIDS deaths occurring and the contextual factors.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To evaluate the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the nature of the deaths. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to natural or accidental causes, such as SIDS.

1. **Age of the Babies**: Both babies being approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) when they died could be coincidental given that both were infants and within a vulnerable age range for SIDS, which typically occurs within the first year, with a peak around 2-4 months.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both dying after being fed and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them could be seen as coincidental if the deaths were due to SIDS, as SIDS can occur under various circumstances, including after feeding and during sleep. SIDS is known for occurring unexpectedly in seemingly healthy infants.

3. **SIDS Frequency and Demographics**: SIDS is more common among boys, and given that the overall frequency is 1 in 4,000, the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare but not impossible. The rarity of SIDS and its occurrence in the same family does not directly imply a causal connection between the two events but makes the coincidence noteworthy.

To assess the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty (and thus, the deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural causes), we need to consider how likely it is for two SIDS deaths to occur in the same family and under similar circumstances.

The probability of a single SIDS death is given as 1 in 4,000. The probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is not simply the square of this probability because the events might not be entirely independent (shared genetic or environmental factors could influence the risk). However, research suggests that even after accounting for such factors, the risk of a second SIDS in a family is still significantly higher than in the general population but is not directly calculable from the given data.

The key here is understanding that the specific circumstances (age, time of day, being found by Jane) are not necessarily dependent on Jane's guilt. If we consider SIDS as a possible cause, the fact that both incidents share these similarities might be seen as unfortunate coincidences rather than evidence of Jane's guilt.

The probability judgment of there being these similarities if Jane is not guilty involves complex considerations of the likelihood of SIDS occurring twice in the same family and under similar circumstances. While the occurrence of two SIDS deaths is very rare, it is not impossible. 

Probability Judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would need to be explained by other causes. Hypoxic damage typically results from a lack of oxygen, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be caused by a variety of factors including trauma or asphyxia.

SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically present with specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage or hemorrhages unless there was an underlying condition or an event that led to these outcomes. While some cases diagnosed as SIDS might have underlying pathophysiology that could potentially lead to such findings, the presence of these specific injuries is not characteristic of typical SIDS cases.

Other natural causes or accidents could potentially lead to hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, but these would be unusual and not directly related to SIDS. For instance, an accidental asphyxiation or an undiagnosed medical condition could potentially cause such findings.

However, given that the autopsy findings for Ben are specifically mentioned as being consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it would be unlikely for these findings to be present unless there was an alternative explanation (e.g., an accident or another perpetrator). The presence of such specific and severe injuries makes an accidental or natural cause (like SIDS) less likely.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is relatively unlikely that Ben would have these specific autopsy findings unless there was another plausible explanation.

Probability Judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be unexpected and not typical of SIDS or other natural causes of death. 

- Bruises to the arms and legs could potentially occur accidentally, but multiple bruises might suggest more significant trauma.
- A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly in infants who are not yet mobile. It is a relatively specific indicator of blunt trauma to the mouth, which could occur during forced feeding or smothering.
- Blood in the lung could be indicative of various conditions, including infection, trauma, or other pathologies.

The combination of these findings is highly suggestive of non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, it would be highly unlikely that Andy would have these specific injuries unless there was another plausible explanation (e.g., an accident or another perpetrator).

However, the fact that these injuries were only found upon re-examination suggests that they might have been overlooked or underappreciated initially. If Jane is not guilty, the probability of these findings would depend on alternative explanations for the injuries.

Given that these injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings is low, as it would imply another perpetrator or an extremely unusual coincidence.

Probability Judgment: 5
If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death depends on the circumstances surrounding Ben's death and the medical evidence.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death suggests that there was a significant event or period of hypoxia relatively close to the time of death. If Jane is not guilty, this could imply that some other event or condition led to the hypoxia.

However, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage would be attributed to an event just hours before death without other explanatory factors. SIDS typically does not involve a clear, identifiable cause of death, and significant hypoxic damage might not be expected in a typical SIDS case.

The medical evidence suggesting hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is more consistent with a traumatic or abusive event rather than a natural or accidental cause.

If Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death in the context of a non-traumatic or non-abusive event. The presence of such damage would be more indicative of a significant and potentially traumatic event.

## Step 1: Understand the context of the case and the allegations against Jane.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the allegation that she smothered them. The death of Ben showed signs of hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries, which the prosecution alleges was caused by smothering.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the given information about Ben's condition and the allegation regarding the timing of the hypoxic damage.
The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

## Step 5: Consider how SIDS relates to the hypoxic damage observed in Ben.
SIDS deaths are typically not associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage or other specific pathological findings that would explain the death. The presence of hypoxic damage suggests an episode of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) before death.

## Step 6: Assess the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes a critical issue. SIDS is not typically associated with clear signs of hypoxia before death in the medical history.

## Step 7: Determine the likelihood based on the information given and the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage observed could be seen as inconsistent with a typical SIDS death, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically present with clear signs of hypoxia before death. However, the question is about the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death, not directly about the cause of death.

## Step 8: Relate the medical evidence to the timing of hypoxic damage.
The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion. If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to an unexplained cause like SIDS, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused by an external factor (like smothering) a matter of hours before death is less relevant.

## Step 9: Consider the conditional probability.
The question asks for the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty. This involves considering alternative explanations for the damage.

## Step 10: Reflect on the medical and legal implications.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies an alternative cause of death. However, the specific timing and cause of hypoxic damage are medical judgments.

## Step 11: Final Assessment.
Given Jane is not guilty, the scenario implies that the deaths might be due to natural or unexplained causes. The presence of hypoxic damage suggests an episode of hypoxia. The likelihood that this damage occurred a matter of hours before death under the condition that Jane is not guilty involves assessing whether such damage could occur naturally or be related to the circumstances of death.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Context**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

2. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or any infant death, if there's evidence of hypoxic damage, it suggests some form of oxygen deprivation occurred before death.

3. **Interpreting the Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS, we must consider whether SIDS could result in hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death.

4. **SIDS and Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: By definition, SIDS is sudden and unexpected. While the exact pathophysiology is unknown, the terminal event is thought to occur rapidly. However, it's not typically associated with a clear timeline of hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours" before death in the medical literature. SIDS deaths are generally considered to be sudden, with the infant appearing healthy before being found dead or dying shortly after presentation.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood**: The doctor's statement implies a specific timeline for the hypoxic damage. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, and assuming SIDS doesn't typically involve a prolonged process of hypoxia that is clinically silent for hours before death, the assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" may not align with typical understandings of SIDS.

However, it's crucial to understand that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the presence of hypoxic damage could indicate a pathological process. The question is asking us to assess the likelihood under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, implying an alternative cause like SIDS.

Given that SIDS is a sudden event and not typically characterized by a documented prolonged hypoxic episode before death, if Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" as this timeline does not typically fit the profile of a SIDS death.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and possible explanations for the observed conditions in both Andy and Ben.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the cause of death for both children is likely to be attributed to another factor, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural or accidental cause.

The post-mortem findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the deaths were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional act by her.

The critical piece of information provided is that Ben's autopsy showed injuries that could be indicative of non-accidental trauma, but we're considering a scenario where Jane is not guilty. Thus, we need to consider whether these findings, particularly the hypoxic damage, could be consistent with a non-criminal explanation.

The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death implies a specific timing for when the cause of this damage might have occurred. For someone who is not guilty, like Jane in this hypothetical scenario, the hypoxic damage would need to have an alternative explanation that is not related to an intentional act.

SIDS is often considered when there's no clear cause of death, but it doesn't typically present with the level of trauma described (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). The presence of such significant injuries suggests that the death might not be a straightforward case of SIDS.

However, the question specifically asks us to consider the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty. If we assume Jane is not guilty and the death was due to some other cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage would depend on the nature of that cause.

For SIDS or other natural causes, the specific timing of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death would be unusual because these conditions typically do not have a clearly identifiable agonal period (the period between the onset of a fatal condition and death) that would be characterized by significant hypoxic damage occurring just hours before death.

However, some natural conditions or accidental circumstances could potentially cause hypoxic damage. The likelihood that such damage occurred a matter of hours before death, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there's an alternative plausible explanation for both the cause of death and the observed injuries that doesn't involve Jane's guilt.

Given the provided information and the need to assess the likelihood based on the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to look for an alternative explanation. However, the detailed injuries (like rib injuries and spinal cord damage) are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes.

Therefore, considering Jane is not guilty and looking for an alternative explanation that fits the observed hypoxic damage, the scenario becomes highly speculative. The presence of significant trauma and specific pathological findings (like hypoxic brain damage) suggests a complex situation that may not be easily explained by SIDS or other simple natural causes.

If Jane is not guilty and we're trying to fit the observed findings into a non-criminal framework, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death depends on an alternative, plausible cause that is not clearly outlined by the information given.

The presence of significant and specific injuries makes it less likely that the condition is entirely due to a natural or unexplainable cause like SIDS without any other contributing or causative factors.

The final judgment on the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty, involves weighing the presence of significant trauma and specific pathological findings against possible non-criminal explanations.

**5**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its unpredictability and lack of clear cause or mechanism. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries, initially suggested to the investigators that the death might not be due to SIDS or natural causes but rather to an unnatural cause such as smothering.

However, the assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a critical piece of information. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of sufficient oxygen. In the context of an infant's death, this could be due to various reasons, including but not limited to smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or another natural/accidental cause for the deaths, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes crucial. SIDS is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death, as it is generally understood to be a sudden event.

However, it's also known that some infants who die from SIDS may have had prior episodes of hypoxia or other stressors, though these are not typically quantifiable or directly linked to the cause of death in a straightforward manner.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a significant event or series of events leading to this condition. If Jane is not guilty, one would need to consider whether the hypoxic damage could be related to an accidental or natural cause rather than an intentional act.

Given that SIDS is more common among boys and occurs without a clear explanation, if we were to speculate on an alternative cause that is not related to Jane's actions, we would need to assess whether the hypoxic damage could fit into a scenario that is not related to smothering or intentional harm.

The information provided does not directly support or refute the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death in the context of SIDS or another natural cause. However, it is worth noting that SIDS is not typically characterized by a clear, identifiable episode of hypoxia hours before death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming the death could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as a result of an accidental or unexplained natural process is difficult to quantify directly from the information given.

However, given the context that the prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation of the medical evidence and the alternative explanation being SIDS (which doesn't typically present with clear evidence of hypoxic damage hours before death), if Jane is not guilty, it becomes less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred due to a cause that would be directly related to the prosecution's timeline and interpretation.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of Ben, which include hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor alleged that this damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions, we need to consider if the hypoxic damage could still have occurred due to other reasons.

3. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While SIDS doesn't directly imply a specific cause like hypoxic damage, infants who die from SIDS may have experienced some level of hypoxia before death, though this is more a consequence of the death process rather than a cause.

4. **Analyzing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could still be consistent with certain natural causes of death or conditions that lead to death. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) and the nature of the damage (hypoxic damage) could be critical.

5. **Assessing the Probability**: The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, Ben's death, and hence the hypoxic damage, would not be attributed to her actions (like smothering). The critical question then is whether the hypoxic damage could occur naturally or due to other non-criminal causes a matter of hours before death.

Given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and that the exact mechanisms behind SIDS are not fully understood, it's challenging to directly link SIDS with hypoxic damage occurring hours before death without more context on the nature of the damage and the circumstances leading to Ben's death.

However, the presence of significant autopsy findings (like injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages) in Ben suggests that his death may not be simply categorized as SIDS, as these findings indicate potential trauma or significant stress before death.

If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage to have occurred a matter of hours before death, there needs to be an alternative explanation that is not related to her actions. While some natural conditions or accidental circumstances could potentially lead to hypoxic damage, the presence of other significant injuries makes it less likely that the scenario is simply a case of SIDS or another straightforward natural cause.

**Probability Judgment: 40**

This judgment reflects a relatively low to moderate likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death under the assumption that Jane is not guilty. It acknowledges that while there are potential natural or accidental explanations for hypoxic damage, the presence of other injuries complicates a straightforward attribution to natural causes like SIDS.
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the scenario where Jane's actions are not the cause of the deaths, and an alternative explanation such as SIDS is considered.

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. It's known for occurring suddenly and unexpectedly in infants, typically under one year of age.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: While the exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, research suggests that it may result from a combination of factors including underlying vulnerabilities in the infant and environmental stressors. Some infants who die from SIDS may have had underlying issues that could potentially lead to or be associated with hypoxic damage.

3. **Interpreting the Hypoxic Damage**: The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates that there was a period of reduced oxygen availability to the brain before death. In the context of SIDS or other natural causes, this could potentially be related to a final event or a series of events leading to death.

4. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is crucial. The timing of such damage can be relevant in understanding the sequence of events leading to death. 

5. **Jane's Innocence and the Timing**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the hypoxic damage needs to be unrelated to her actions. The hypothesis here is that both deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause.

6. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and both deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before Ben's death could be plausible. SIDS deaths are sudden and unexpected, and it's conceivable that the process leading to death could involve hypoxic damage. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours) might not be directly related to the typical understanding of SIDS as an immediate event.

7. **Conclusion**: Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death would depend on the specifics of the case, including the pathology and any potential underlying conditions in Ben. However, SIDS is typically associated with a rapid progression to death, and the presence of significant hypoxic damage hours before might not align with the typical SIDS profile.

Since Jane is not guilty, and we are considering an alternative explanation for Ben's death, such as SIDS, and given the specifics of the case (like the presence of hypoxic damage), we are evaluating the likelihood of a specific medical finding (hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death) in the context of a natural or unexplained cause of death.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries and the possibility of SIDS.

1. **Understanding the Injuries and Hypoxic Damage**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which can be caused by various factors including smothering, but also other medical or accidental conditions.

2. **Alternative Explanations for Hypoxic Damage**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or other natural or accidental causes. SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature, despite thorough investigation. However, the presence of specific injuries (like those found in Ben and retrospectively in Andy) complicates the attribution of their deaths to SIDS alone.

3. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is significant. If Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage, if it occurred, would need to have an alternative explanation that is consistent with the timeline and the circumstances of Ben's death.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: 
    - If Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing would be expected to be consistent with such a cause if it were possible.
    - SIDS does not typically present with clear evidence of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death as its diagnostic features are largely based on the exclusion of other causes of death and the lack of explanation for the death.
    - However, some conditions that could potentially cause SIDS or SIDS-like deaths might also result in hypoxic damage.

5. **Evaluating the Specific Claim**: The assertion that hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" being related to Jane's guilt or innocence hinges on whether such a timeframe is consistent with an innocent explanation. If the damage occurred due to an unknown or natural cause, the timing might not directly implicate Jane's actions.

6. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering the possibility that the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to an innocent cause is uncertain. The presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries does not easily align with a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, which complicates the assessment.

Given the information and focusing on the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we are dealing with a complex scenario that involves weighing the possibility of SIDS or other natural causes against the observed evidence of injuries.

The probability judgment for the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty involves considering whether an innocent explanation could plausibly result in such a scenario.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of smothering her two children. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of Ben, which included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The prosecution's expert testified that this damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death.

3. **Jane's Innocence Presumption**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by her. An alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

4. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. It's crucial to understand that SIDS, by definition, occurs without a clear cause or explanation, including the presence of significant hypoxic damage that can be timed to a specific period before death.

5. **Analyzing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes crucial. However, the occurrence of SIDS does not directly explain the hypoxic damage or the other injuries found. 

6. **Alternative Explanations**: If the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, one might expect the hypoxic damage (if it occurred) to be part of the terminal events or agonal phase, potentially aligning with the timing suggested by the prosecution. However, SIDS typically does not present with clear evidence of significant ante-mortem hypoxic damage that can be so precisely timed.

7. **Likelihood Assessment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or a similar condition, the specific timing of hypoxic damage as suggested (a matter of hours before death) may not be directly related to an intentional act by Jane. However, the presence of such damage and its timing is not directly explained by SIDS either.

8. **Conclusion**: The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty hinges on whether one believes the damage is consistent with a natural cause of death or an agonal process. The prosecution's assertion that it occurred hours before death may or may not be compatible with a natural death scenario, depending on the underlying cause.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or a similar natural cause as an explanation, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as alleged is not directly supported or refuted by SIDS itself. However, it's worth considering that SIDS deaths are not typically characterized by such clear ante-mortem hypoxic damage.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The exact cause or mechanism is unknown, but there are identified risk factors.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS, it's plausible that the process leading to death involves periods of hypoxia. However, the timing and nature of such hypoxia can vary.

3. **Analyzing the Statement**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
    - If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage could be consistent with the pathophysiology of the death, as SIDS may involve episodes of hypoxia.
    - The key issue is whether the hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours before death" is consistent with a SIDS death. Research and medical understanding suggest that the process leading to SIDS can involve agonal periods (the period of struggle or distress just before death) where hypoxia might occur.

5. **Assessing the Timing**: 
    - The timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) in the context of SIDS is not typically characterized or well-documented in a way that provides a clear probability. SIDS is, by definition, unexplained, and the timeline of events leading to it is not well understood.

6. **Conclusion**: 
    - If Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS, the fact that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death doesn't necessarily contradict the SIDS diagnosis, as it could be part of the agonal process.
    - The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty (and thus Ben died of SIDS) depends on understanding that SIDS deaths can involve complex and not fully understood pathophysiological processes.

Given these considerations, and in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary or detailed medical literature that directly addresses the timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS cases, it is reasonable to consider that hypoxic damage could occur in the period leading up to death in SIDS cases.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to another cause, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which can occur due to various reasons including smothering, but also other causes that could lead to asphyxia or respiratory distress.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the presence of hypoxic damage might seem contradictory because SIDS, by definition, is a sudden and unexplained death, and it's not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxia occurring hours before death.

However, it's crucial to understand that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered after all other causes of death have been ruled out. Some research and medical opinions suggest that certain findings, like those seen in Ben's autopsy, could be consistent with a severe, terminal event rather than a separate, earlier hypoxic episode. The exact timing and interpretation of hypoxic damage can be complex and depend on various factors, including the nature of the insult and the infant's response.

The prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation of the autopsy findings as indicative of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and if we consider an alternative explanation like SIDS, the interpretation of the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes speculative.

Given that SIDS is sudden and unexpected, if Ben's death was due to SIDS, it would be less likely that significant hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" as this implies a separate, identifiable event leading to hypoxia, which doesn't align with the typical understanding of SIDS as an acute event.

However, the presence of hypoxic damage suggests some form of distress or issue before death. If we are to consider Jane not guilty and explore the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring hours before death under this assumption, we need to question whether the death could be attributed to a cause that still results in hypoxic damage but isn't necessarily indicative of smothering by Jane.

The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on the assumption that it is related to the cause of death, which the prosecution links to smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and if the death is attributed to another cause, the relevance and timing of this damage need to be considered in that context.

The key issue here is that if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to an unexplained cause like SIDS, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as stated by the doctor becomes less certain. It depends on how one interprets the cause of the hypoxic damage and whether it is compatible with SIDS or another natural cause.

Given the complexities and the assumptions involved, if Jane is not guilty, and we're considering an alternative cause like SIDS, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a separate event, because SIDS is typically characterized by its suddenness.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and the information given about the case.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries found during the autopsy of Ben, suggests that there might have been some form of distress or incident leading to his death. However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

The initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death, which could be consistent with SIDS, especially given the age of the infant at the time of death (11 weeks). The subsequent findings on Andy's autopsy photographs, which revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were interpreted as indicative of non-accidental injury. However, if Jane is not guilty, these findings would need an alternative explanation.

For Ben, the autopsy findings included injuries that could be indicative of a traumatic event or severe stress before death. The hypoxic damage to the brain suggests a lack of oxygen, which could occur due to various reasons, not necessarily due to smothering.

If Jane is not guilty and both deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is a complex issue. SIDS can sometimes be associated with certain pathological findings, but these are typically non-specific.

The critical point is that if the deaths are due to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage might not necessarily indicate a traumatic cause like smothering but could be part of the complex pathology seen in some SIDS cases. However, the specific timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred (a matter of hours before death) is not directly related to the guilt or innocence of Jane regarding the cause of death.

The doctor's statement implies a causal link between the hypoxic damage and the events leading to Ben's death. If we are to assess this under the condition that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause), we must consider that SIDS can present with various pathological changes.

However, the detailed autopsy findings for Ben, including specific injuries, do not typically align with the classic definition of SIDS, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of significant injuries (like rib and spinal cord injuries) and hypoxic damage complicates the picture and suggests that, if Jane is not guilty, there might be an alternative, unexplained cause for these findings.

Given this scenario and focusing on the question of whether the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to recognize that the underlying cause of the damage (whether traumatic or due to some other mechanism related to SIDS or another condition) is crucial.

The probability judgment hinges on understanding the medical evidence in the context of Jane's guilt or innocence. The condition that Jane is not guilty implies looking for an explanation other than smothering for the hypoxic damage.

Since the autopsy findings for Ben do suggest significant distress or possible traumatic injury before death, and given that SIDS is typically not associated with such clear signs of trauma, the scenario presents a complex medical and legal challenge.

If we are to evaluate the likelihood based on the condition that Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative natural cause or SIDS (despite the atypical autopsy findings for SIDS), the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (hours before death) could still be plausible depending on the underlying cause.

However, the detailed and specific nature of the autopsy findings for both children, particularly Ben, makes it challenging to attribute the cause of death to SIDS without considering other potential explanations.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the scenario where Jane is innocent, implying that the deaths could be due to other causes such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the condition (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain) must be explained by an alternative cause. SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. However, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, is not typical for SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The hypoxic damage indicating a lack of oxygen to the brain can occur due to various reasons, including smothering or other forms of asphyxia, but also potentially due to other medical conditions or accidents that result in asphyxia or lack of oxygen.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are looking at an alternative explanation for Ben's death, the specific timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred becomes crucial. The allegation that the hypoxic damage happened "a matter of hours before death" is significant because it implies a specific timeline for when the cause of the hypoxic damage occurred.

In cases where the death is not due to smothering or intentional act by Jane, the timing and cause of hypoxic damage could vary. However, the presence of significant injuries (like those described for Ben) complicates the picture and typically suggests that the death was not simply SIDS.

If we consider that the death was due to an unexplained or accidental cause rather than smothering, the fact that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death might still be plausible due to a variety of potential causes (e.g., an acute medical condition or an accident leading to asphyxia).

However, given that the condition of Ben (hypoxic damage, injuries to ribs and spinal cord, etc.) is not typical for SIDS and suggests some form of traumatic or asphyxial event, the likelihood that this occurred "a matter of hours before death" if Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there's an alternative plausible explanation for these findings that also fits the timeline.

The prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation that these injuries were inflicted by Jane, indicating guilt. If Jane is not guilty, we're left to consider whether an alternative cause (not necessarily SIDS, given the nature of the injuries) could result in similar findings and whether the timing fits.

Given the complexity and the specific details of the case (notably the significant injuries found on Ben), while it's challenging to assign a precise probability without more context on alternative explanations, the question specifically asks us to assume Jane is not guilty.

The injuries and hypoxic damage found in Ben are highly suggestive of a non-natural cause, which complicates attributing them to SIDS or a similar natural cause. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, one might still need to explain these findings through other means.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty, would depend on the likelihood of an alternative cause that also resulted in the observed injuries and fits the timeline.

Given the available information and the specifics of the case, and acknowledging that the described injuries are not typical for SIDS and suggest a traumatic event, if Jane is not guilty, it is still challenging to provide a straightforward explanation that fits the observed facts.

**60**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her. The alternative explanation given is SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

2. **SIDS and its implications**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS is not known, but there are identified risk factors.

3. **Hypoxic damage in the context of SIDS**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or any infant death, if the death is sudden and unexpected, the presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways. If an infant dies from SIDS, it's possible that some degree of hypoxia occurred as part of the dying process, although the exact timing and cause might not be clear.

4. **Assessing the likelihood**: The statement that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain "must have been caused a matter of hours before death" is a medical interpretation. If Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage could be part of the dying process. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear evidence of when or how the hypoxic damage occurred.

5. **Medical interpretation and SIDS**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is an interpretation based on medical findings. If Ben's death is considered to be due to SIDS, the assumption is that the death was sudden and unexpected, potentially making the timing of hypoxic damage less clear-cut.

6. **Likelihood assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS as an alternative explanation, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as a definitive statement may not directly correlate with SIDS, as SIDS does not typically come with a clear timeline of when the fatal process began. However, it's plausible that in some cases of SIDS, there could be some agonal (dying) process that might involve hypoxia. The critical question is whether the medical evidence (hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death) is consistent with SIDS.

Given the lack of clear cause and mechanism in SIDS, and considering the medical evidence, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death isn't directly supported or refuted by the scenario of SIDS alone. However, the prosecution's case relies on interpreting the hypoxic damage and other injuries as indicative of a non-natural cause of death.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming SIDS, the specific timing of hypoxic damage might not be a critical or determinable factor in the same way it is when attributing death to a deliberate act like smothering.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and implications of Jane's innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The alternative explanation provided for their deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age. The pathophysiology of SIDS is not well understood, and it is diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

The findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were interpreted as evidence against Jane. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these findings could be consistent with SIDS or another natural cause.

Hypoxic damage to the brain indicates that the brain suffered from a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or other natural causes, this could potentially occur due to various mechanisms, such as respiratory distress or failure. However, the presence of such significant pathological findings is not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS, as SIDS is generally considered a diagnosis of exclusion where the autopsy does not reveal a cause of death.

The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline for the onset of the hypoxic event leading to Ben's death. If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the expectation might be that the process leading to death was more immediate or not necessarily tied to an external act like smothering.

However, the detailed autopsy findings (hypoxic damage, injuries to ribs and spinal cord, etc.) are not typical of a classic SIDS presentation. SIDS deaths are usually characterized by a lack of significant findings at autopsy that would explain the death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, it would be less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" as a result of an external act (since that would imply guilt). Instead, one might expect either a more immediate cause or a different interpretation of the timing and nature of the hypoxic damage.

However, the question is asking us to assess the likelihood under the assumption of Jane's innocence, which implies looking for an explanation that doesn't involve her guilt. The autopsy findings, however, suggest a more complex scenario than what is typically seen in SIDS.

Given the complex and not fully explained nature of SIDS and the specific autopsy findings, if Jane is not guilty, it is still challenging to directly link the hypoxic damage to a natural cause without more information on the exact circumstances.

The probability judgment on whether the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty would depend on understanding that the hypoxic damage's timing is inferred from medical evidence. If Jane is not guilty, and we are to believe an alternative cause like SIDS, the expectation around the timing and nature of hypoxic damage might not directly apply as it would in a case of smothering.

However, the presence of significant autopsy findings already casts doubt on a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

**50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact mechanisms behind SIDS are not fully understood, research has identified various risk factors, such as the age of the infant, sleeping position, exposure to smoke, and genetic predispositions. However, the pathology of SIDS is generally not associated with the specific injuries found in Ben, such as hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic damage, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, etc.) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not usually present with such significant pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.

The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, as described, suggests a lack of oxygen, which could be due to various causes, including smothering or other forms of asphyxia. If Jane is not guilty, this implies that the hypoxic damage might have been caused by some other means or could be related to the circumstances surrounding Ben's death that are not related to Jane's actions.

However, the key issue here is whether the hypoxic damage could have occurred a matter of hours before death in the context of SIDS or another non-criminal cause. 

Given the medical evidence described, if Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage and other traumatic injuries is not typical. The description given (hypoxic damage to the brain, etc.) is more suggestive of an event (like smothering) that occurred around the time of death rather than an ongoing condition or SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to a cause unrelated to her actions, because the damage described is indicative of a significant and acute event rather than a condition that would be characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the possible causes of hypoxic damage in the context of the case and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of infant deaths, this could be due to various reasons, including smothering, as alleged in Jane's case, or other medical conditions.

2. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infants under one year of age. The exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, but it's associated with various risk factors. The presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways depending on the underlying cause of death.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of intentional act by Jane. In this scenario, we're considering SIDS or another natural cause as a plausible explanation for their deaths.

4. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: While SIDS is by definition an unexplained death, some SIDS cases may show signs of hypoxia or other stressors before death. However, the pathophysiology of SIDS is complex and not fully understood. It's plausible that some infants experiencing SIDS could have had episodes of hypoxia or stress before death, but the timing and nature of such episodes can vary.

5. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death is a specific claim that requires careful consideration. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained natural cause, the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death could be plausible. SIDS deaths are often unwitnessed, and the terminal events are not observed. However, it's also possible that the hypoxic damage could be a part of the agonal process or related to the final events leading to death.

6. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is related to our understanding of the pathophysiology of SIDS and similar conditions. While the exact timing and mechanisms are not well-defined, it's conceivable that hypoxic damage could occur in the process leading to death.

Given the lack of clear evidence linking the timing of hypoxic damage directly to the guilt or innocence of Jane and considering that SIDS or a similar natural cause could potentially involve episodes of hypoxia, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty could be considered plausible but not certain.

**80**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to another cause, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The description provided for SIDS indicates it's a sudden and unexplained death in infants, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that the cause of Ben's death might not be due to smothering or any deliberate act by Jane. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries does not directly align with the typical description of SIDS, as these findings suggest some form of trauma or asphyxiation.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we're exploring an alternative explanation for Ben's death that doesn't involve her direct action. The autopsy findings, however, strongly suggest some form of traumatic or asphyxial event rather than SIDS alone.

The statement that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain "must have been caused a matter of hours before death" is a medical interpretation based on the condition found during the autopsy. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which could result from various causes, including asphyxiation.

If we are to assume Jane is not guilty and explore the possibility that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes critical. The fact that the damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" is consistent with an acute event leading to asphyxiation or a similar cause. However, if Jane is not guilty, we're left to consider whether such findings could be consistent with an accidental or natural cause.

In cases where the deaths are attributed to SIDS, the expectation is that the infants would be otherwise healthy and the death unexpected. While SIDS can involve some pathological findings, the extensive injuries described for Ben are not typical.

The critical question revolves around the interpretation of "a matter of hours before death." If Jane is not guilty, the event causing hypoxic damage should be an accidental or natural occurrence. However, the specific timing (hours before death) as suggested by the medical interpretation, might not directly correlate with typical SIDS cases, as SIDS is generally understood to be an event happening around the time of death.

Given the context and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death due to an accidental or natural cause not related to Jane's actions is low because the described injuries and damage are indicative of a significant event, which is not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional act by Jane. In such a case, we have to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries and conditions, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the subsequent findings in Andy's autopsy, initially suggested to the investigators that the deaths might not have been natural. However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be consistent with an alternative explanation.

SIDS is often considered when there's no clear cause of death in infants. However, SIDS typically doesn't present with the extensive injuries found in Ben (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages, etc.). These specific findings are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than SIDS.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a critical piece of information. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it becomes challenging to explain the hypoxic damage as occurring just before death without attributing it to an external or unnatural cause.

However, there's a possibility that the hypoxic damage could be misinterpreted or that there are rare natural conditions that could result in similar findings. 

Given that Ben's death is being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and thus looking for alternative explanations, we need to assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death under natural or non-criminal circumstances.

The likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there are plausible natural or accidental explanations for Ben's condition. If we are to assume the death was not due to smothering or a similar act, there are still several other potential causes of hypoxic damage (e.g., accidental asphyxia, undiagnosed medical conditions, etc.), though they are quite rare.

Therefore, while it is less likely for the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage to be explained by SIDS or other completely natural causes without any suspicious circumstances, there could be other rare medical or accidental explanations.

The probability judgment is: 20
If Jane is not guilty, the deaths of Andy and Ben would be attributed to natural causes or accidents rather than to any intentional act by Jane. The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day, the circumstance of being recently fed, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could initially seem suspicious and suggestive of a pattern.

However, if we consider that both deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural causes, some of these similarities can be explained by the circumstances common to both infants. For example, both being around the same age and being fed before being put to bed are common practices and conditions for infants of that age group.

The fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious is also not surprising, given that she was their primary caregiver. It's plausible that she was with them during their last moments or discovered them because of her caregiving role.

While SIDS can occur without warning and is somewhat random, certain risk factors and circumstances (like age and time of day) can be somewhat similar due to the typical patterns of infant care.

However, the likelihood of two SIDS deaths occurring under very similar circumstances in the same family is low, not because SIDS is contagious or directly related to familial factors in a deterministic way, but because SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000).

The probability that both deaths occur under similar circumstances by coincidence is not extremely high, given the rarity of SIDS and the specificity of the circumstances. Still, it is not impossible.

Considering these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring by chance is not very high but is not entirely implausible either.

The probability judgment is: 10
If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would need to be explained by alternative causes that are not related to her actions.

The presence of these specific injuries is often associated with non-accidental trauma or abuse. However, it's also possible, though less likely, that some of these findings could be due to other causes or misinterpreted.

- Bruises to the arms and legs could potentially occur accidentally, though in an infant, they are unusual and concerning for non-accidental injury.
- A torn frenulum can occur due to a fall or other trauma, but in an infant who is not yet mobile, this is also concerning for abuse.
- Blood in the lung could be due to a variety of causes, including infection, but in the context of other injuries, it raises concerns.

If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider rare or alternative explanations for these findings that do not involve intentional harm by Jane. However, the combination of these specific injuries is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma.

The likelihood of these findings occurring without Jane being guilty is low because the injuries are characteristic of inflicted trauma. However, it's not impossible that there could be some rare medical condition or accidental explanation, though this would be unusual.

The probability judgment is: 5
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her intentional actions, such as smothering. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a significant and severe event that resulted in asphyxia or severe trauma.

These findings are characteristic of non-accidental injury, particularly smothering or violent shaking. If Jane is not guilty, then alternative explanations for these severe injuries need to be considered.

However, it's challenging to attribute these specific injuries to natural causes or accidents that do not involve intentional harm. While rare medical conditions could potentially cause some of these findings, the combination of hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is highly suggestive of severe and acute trauma.

Given the nature of these injuries, if Jane is not guilty, it's unlikely that they would occur without some form of external or traumatic cause. However, attributing them to an accident or a rare condition rather than an intentional act by Jane is not entirely implausible, though it would be unusual.

The likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty is low because they strongly suggest non-accidental trauma.

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries and the possibility that the deaths were due to SIDS or another cause.

First, let's analyze the given information and the implications of Jane being not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of death for both Andy and Ben would not be due to smothering by Jane. The prosecution's case relies heavily on the autopsy findings for both children, which were interpreted as evidence of smothering.

For Ben, the autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be consistent with an alternative cause of death, such as SIDS or another medical condition.

SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes of death have been ruled out. The fact that SIDS is more common among boys and has a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK is given. However, the presence of specific autopsy findings in Ben (and later found in Andy upon re-examination) such as injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, makes SIDS less likely as these findings suggest a possible traumatic or asphyxial cause rather than the typical presentation of SIDS, which is generally characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings.

The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is a critical point. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage would need to have an alternative explanation. 

However, the detailed autopsy findings for Ben are not typical for SIDS, and the re-evaluation of Andy's autopsy also revealed findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) that are not characteristic of SIDS. 

The question asks us to assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty. To do this, we need to consider if there's an alternative plausible explanation for the hypoxic damage and other injuries that doesn't involve Jane's guilt.

If we were to assume that the deaths were due to a medical condition or accident not related to Jane's actions, the timing of the hypoxic damage would be a part of understanding the sequence of events leading to Ben's death. However, the specific details provided do not directly support an alternative cause that is both plausible and linked to the timing of the hypoxic damage.

Given the information and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider whether the observed hypoxic damage could have occurred a matter of hours before death under circumstances not related to Jane's actions.

The specific autopsy findings for Ben are indicative of a significant event or condition that led to his death. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death gives a timeline but does not directly prove or disprove Jane's guilt or innocence.

To provide a probability judgment, we must weigh the plausibility of alternative explanations against the given scenario. If Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to another cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death would depend on the specifics of that alternative cause.

Given the information and the constraints, a definitive alternative explanation isn't provided, making it challenging to directly assess the likelihood of the timing of the hypoxic damage without more context on potential alternative causes.

However, the presence of significant autopsy findings makes SIDS or a straightforward natural cause less likely for both infants.

Therefore, without a clear alternative explanation and based on the information given, one might be inclined to consider the prosecution's interpretation as having some basis. Yet, we're tasked with assessing the likelihood under the condition that Jane is not guilty.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To address this question, let's analyze the information given and the implications for Jane's guilt or innocence regarding the deaths of her children, particularly focusing on the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and its timing.

1. **Understanding the Case Against Jane**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The evidence against her includes autopsy findings on both children that suggest injuries inconsistent with natural causes or SIDS.

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: Ben's autopsy revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen.

3. **Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The prosecution's expert alleges that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. This timing is crucial because it could imply that Jane caused the damage (and thus the death) by smothering Ben shortly before the ambulance was called.

4. **Considering Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother her children. In this scenario, we need to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries and the hypoxic damage.

5. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: For Jane to be innocent, there needs to be a plausible alternative explanation for the deaths. SIDS is mentioned as a possible cause. However, SIDS is typically diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out, and it doesn't typically present with the severe injuries found in Ben.

6. **Evaluating the Likelihood of Hypoxic Damage Timing if Jane is Innocent**: If Jane is innocent, then the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused by some other factor or condition that led to his death. The key question is whether this damage could have occurred "a matter of hours before death" due to natural causes or an accident.

Given the autopsy findings, if Jane is innocent, the hypoxic damage could potentially be attributed to other causes that are not related to her actions (e.g., an underlying medical condition or an accident). However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) as alleged is crucial.

The prosecution's assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on expert interpretation of the autopsy findings. If Jane is innocent, one would expect alternative explanations for the observed damage and its timing. 

However, without specific evidence or an alternative expert opinion that contradicts the prosecution's timing, assessing the likelihood directly from the given information is challenging.

**Assessing Probability**: If Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative cause for Ben's death and injuries, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as stated, hinges on the validity of the prosecution's expert testimony and the presence of any contradictory evidence or alternative explanations.

Given the details provided and assuming Jane's innocence, there's a plausible argument that the hypoxic damage could still have occurred shortly before death due to some other cause. However, the presence of other injuries complicates a simple SIDS or natural cause explanation.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
Let's analyze the information provided to understand the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.

First, we need to understand that if Jane is not guilty, then the death of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS, as suggested in the background.

1. **Understanding SIDS and its Implications**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, but it's associated with various risk factors.

2. **Analyzing the Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage and other injuries found on Ben could be questioned in the context of SIDS or another accidental or natural cause.

3. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS by definition is a sudden and unexpected death. While some SIDS cases might show signs that could be interpreted as hypoxic damage due to the death process, SIDS itself isn't directly associated with a specific timeframe of hypoxia before death. The diagnosis of SIDS typically doesn't include evidence of a prolonged period of hypoxia before death.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we're considering SIDS or a similar natural cause for Ben's death, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes a critical point. The prosecution's case hinges on the idea that Jane caused the deaths, possibly by smothering, which would lead to hypoxic damage. If Jane is innocent, and Ben died of SIDS, the hypoxic damage could potentially be a result of the process leading to death, but SIDS doesn't typically imply a "matter of hours" of hypoxia before death; it's more about a sudden event.

5. **Interpreting the Doctor's Statement**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and is used to support the theory that the death was not due to SIDS but was caused by an action (like smothering) that led to hypoxia.

If Jane is not guilty, the assumption is that Ben's death could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the presence of significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death doesn't align well with the typical understanding of SIDS, which is characterized by its sudden and unexpected nature.

**Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming the deaths are due to SIDS or a similar cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death as suggested by the prosecution's medical expert is low because SIDS is not typically associated with a prolonged period of hypoxia before death.**

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's case, it indicates that his brain suffered from insufficient oxygen supply.

2. **Cause of Hypoxic Damage in Infants**: In infants, hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons, including smothering, other forms of asphyxia, or natural causes that lead to respiratory distress or failure.

3. **Jane's Innocence and the Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother Ben. Therefore, any hypoxic damage would have to be the result of natural causes or an accident.

4. **Considering SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion that is considered when an infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and no cause of death is found after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While SIDS is associated with certain risk factors, its exact cause remains unknown.

5. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage must have occurred due to reasons other than smothering by Jane.

6. **The Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage occurred just hours before death without preceding symptoms or conditions that would have been noticeable.

7. **Evaluating Likelihood**: The presence of hypoxic damage, along with other specific injuries (like injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), suggests a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than a typical SIDS scenario, which is generally not associated with such specific and significant pathological findings. 

8. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS or another non-traumatic reason, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is low because SIDS or other natural causes typically do not result in the specific pattern of injuries seen in Ben.

Given the injuries and the findings, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that the specific timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) would be directly related to a natural cause of death like SIDS. However, the detailed autopsy findings for Ben already suggest a non-natural cause, complicating the assumption of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and possible explanations for the observed injuries and the condition of Ben at the time of death.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to natural or accidental causes rather than inflicted harm. The alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism for the death, and it does not typically involve specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain unless there was an underlying condition or event leading to the death.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates that there was a period of reduced oxygen availability to the brain before death. If Jane is not guilty, several scenarios could be considered:

1. **Accidental or Natural Causes**: If Ben's death was due to an accidental or natural cause, the hypoxic damage could be related to the underlying cause of death. For instance, if Ben had an underlying respiratory condition or suffered an accidental asphyxiation (not inflicted by Jane), this could result in hypoxic damage.

2. **SIDS with Complicating Factors**: While SIDS is by definition unexplained, some cases might involve underlying vulnerabilities or conditions that could lead to hypoxia. However, attributing the hypoxic damage directly to SIDS might be challenging because SIDS is typically diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, if we were to consider alternative explanations for Ben's condition (hypoxic damage), we have to assess how plausible it is that such damage occurred a matter of hours before death.

The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death implies a relatively acute event. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative cause for Ben's death, the timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) could be plausible if there was an event or condition (natural or accidental) that led to this damage shortly before death.

However, the critical question is whether this aligns with a scenario where Jane is not guilty. The prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation that the injuries and conditions observed in both children were not due to natural causes or SIDS but were inflicted.

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are to be explained by SIDS or another natural/accidental cause, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (hours before death) needs to be considered in the context of the cause of death. SIDS is sudden and unexpected, and while it doesn't directly explain the hypoxic damage, an underlying condition or a specific accidental cause could potentially do so.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty, would be influenced by the plausibility of an alternative cause that could result in such damage.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm inflicted by her. Given this context, if we are to assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for their deaths, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. In the context of SIDS or accidental causes, hypoxic damage could occur due to various reasons, not necessarily due to smothering. However, the timing of when this damage occurred is crucial.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained natural cause, the hypoxic damage could potentially be part of the process leading to his death. The assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical judgment that needs careful consideration.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While it's known that SIDS can involve hypoxic damage as part of the terminal events, the timing of such damage can vary. The exact mechanism or timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS cases isn't always clear-cut and can be subject to interpretation.

However, the key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we're operating under the assumption that Ben's death wasn't due to smothering or a deliberate act. The doctor's statement about the timing of the hypoxic damage is based on medical evidence and expertise.

In cases where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, the pathological findings can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. The presence of hypoxic damage indicates that there was a period of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) before death, but the exact timing can depend on various factors including the cause of the hypoxia.

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether the available medical evidence supports this timing under the hypothesis that the death was not due to smothering.

If we are to trust the doctor's expertise and the medical evidence, and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying Ben's death was not a result of smothering or similar), the statement about the timing of the hypoxic damage being a matter of hours before death could be seen as a medical assessment based on the evidence available.

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and considering the information given, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death would logically depend on the validity and interpretation of the medical evidence.

Given the information and focusing on the task:

80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to her intentional actions such as smothering. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen and possible trauma.

While these findings are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, they are not exclusive to such causes. Other explanations, though potentially less likely, could theoretically result in similar pathological findings.

In the context of SIDS or other unexplained infant deaths, some infants may exhibit signs of hypoxia or other distress. However, the specific combination of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more typically associated with a traumatic or asphyxial event.

If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider alternative explanations for these findings. Some natural conditions or accidental events could potentially cause similar damage, but they are relatively rare and often have other distinguishing features.

The likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) occurring in the absence of smothering or violent trauma is relatively low, as they are more commonly associated with such events.

However, it's also possible that the actual cause of death and the pathological findings could be related to a less understood or rare condition.

Therefore, while the presence of these findings is concerning for a traumatic cause, if Jane is not guilty, it suggests that either there was an alternative explanation for these findings or that the interpretation of the findings as indicative of smothering/trauma might be subject to some debate.

Given the context and focusing on the task:

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her intentional actions, such as smothering or abuse.

The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of trauma and are often associated with non-accidental injury or abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often considered a significant indicator of potential non-accidental injury in infants, as it can result from a blow to the mouth.

If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider alternative explanations for these findings. While it's possible that some of these signs could be attributed to accidental trauma, the specific combination and nature of these injuries (especially a torn frenulum) are less likely to be accidental in an infant who was otherwise healthy before being put to bed.

However, the original post-mortem suggested natural causes of death, and it is possible that upon re-examination, some findings could be interpreted differently or considered less conclusive.

The likelihood of these specific findings occurring in the absence of abuse or smothering is generally considered low because they are typically associated with non-accidental trauma.

Given that Jane is not guilty implies that Andy's death and injuries were not a result of her actions. Therefore, one must consider the possibility of an alternative, albeit unlikely, explanation for the observed injuries or the possibility that the interpretation of these findings as indicative of abuse might be subject to some debate or reconsideration.

However, the presence of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is typically considered to be strongly indicative of non-accidental trauma.

Given the context and focusing on the task:

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to her intentional actions.

The similarities between the two incidents include the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died (after being fed), and the circumstance that Jane was alone with them when they were found unconscious.

Some of these similarities can be attributed to the natural circumstances and routines associated with infant care. For example, both babies being approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) is not highly unusual, given that they are siblings born about a year apart. Infants are often fed and put to bed around the same time of day, which could explain why they died at a similar time of day.

However, the specific combination of these factors (age, time of day, being alone with Jane, and being found unconscious after feeding) could be considered in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

SIDS cases often occur in infants who are seemingly healthy and can happen at any time, but there are some common factors, such as the infant being in a prone position or being found unresponsive after being put to bed.

The probability of two siblings dying under similar circumstances (age, time of day, being found by the same person) due to SIDS or other natural causes is low but not impossible. Research has shown that while the risk of SIDS is higher in families with a previous SIDS death, the absolute risk remains low.

The likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance, assuming Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS, is difficult to quantify but is generally considered to be low due to the specific nature of the circumstances.

However, given that the alternative explanation (Jane being guilty) involves a very specific and serious allegation, the assessment of the likelihood of these similarities under the assumption of innocence is crucial.

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries to Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or accidental injuries.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, however, are not typical characteristics of SIDS. These findings are more indicative of some form of trauma or abuse.

However, it's also possible that some of these findings could be misinterpreted or could have occurred accidentally. For example, a torn frenulum can occur accidentally in infants, though it is often associated with non-accidental injury. Bruises can also occur accidentally, but again, they are a concern for abuse.

If we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be explained by other factors or if they are indeed indicative of an unnatural cause that doesn't involve Jane's intentional act.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur accidentally, but in the context of an infant who is not yet mobile, they are concerning for abuse.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This can occur accidentally but is also a known indicator of potential non-accidental injury.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding could be related to a variety of causes, including infection, aspiration, or trauma.

Given that the initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes, and assuming Jane is not guilty, one might hypothesize that the findings could be due to an undiagnosed condition or an accidental injury that was not recognized as such at the time.

However, the presence of these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) on re-examination significantly complicates the SIDS hypothesis for Andy's death, as they do not align with the typical profile of SIDS, which is generally considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion after thorough investigation rules out other causes.

The likelihood of these findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering or abusing the children) hinges on alternative explanations. These could include undiagnosed medical conditions, accidental trauma that was not initially recognized, or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings.

Given the context and the specifics of the findings, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these findings are present due to other causes or explanations is relatively low, because they strongly suggest some form of trauma or non-accidental injury.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the initial diagnosis of Andy's death as being due to natural causes and the possibility that his death was actually due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are typically indicative of non-accidental injury.

However, it's also important to note that some of these findings can be associated with other conditions or can be misinterpreted. For example, a torn frenulum can occur due to a fall or other accidents, though it's often considered a red flag for non-accidental injury. Blood in the lung could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection or trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any other form of non-accidental injury caused by her. In that case, we are left to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to accidental injury, though in an 11-week-old infant, significant bruising is unusual and warrants further investigation. Some medical conditions could potentially cause or mimic bruising.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This is often associated with non-accidental injury but can also occur accidentally, though it's less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of an underlying condition or infection.

The key issue here is whether these findings can be explained by natural causes, accidental injury, or if they strongly suggest non-accidental injury. The fact that Andy's initial autopsy suggested natural causes and it was only upon re-examination, prompted by the suspicious findings in Ben's autopsy, that these injuries were noted, complicates the interpretation.

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an explanation that does not involve non-accidental injury caused by her. However, the presence of these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in an infant is generally considered suspicious for non-accidental injury.

To quantify the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely they are to occur by chance or due to other causes in an infant who died suddenly. The literature on SIDS does not typically highlight these specific findings as characteristic.

Given the information and typical interpretations in forensic pathology, if Jane is not guilty (implying the injuries were not inflicted by her), the presence of these specific injuries would be considered unusual and not typical of SIDS or most natural causes.

Probability judgment: 5
To assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the possible causes of these findings and whether they are consistent with alternative explanations, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This indicates that the brain suffered from a lack of oxygen. While this can occur due to smothering or other forms of asphyxia, it can also result from various other causes such as severe infection, cardiac issues, or other conditions that impair oxygenation.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are often associated with increased pressure or trauma, which can be seen in cases of asphyxia, including smothering. However, they can also be seen in other conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, we're considering scenarios where Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of non-accidental injury caused by her. The findings in Ben could be due to other causes, but both hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are more suggestive of an asphyxial event or significant stress at the time of death.

While it's possible to have hypoxic brain damage due to natural causes (e.g., severe respiratory infection), the combination with hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids points more towards an event that caused significant stress or asphyxia.

SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically does not present with such significant pathological findings indicative of asphyxia or trauma. Thus, the presence of these specific findings is less likely to be associated with SIDS.

Given the information, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) occurring due to other causes is lower than if they were directly related to smothering or non-accidental injury.

Probability judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, we're considering scenarios where Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of non-accidental injury caused by her. The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death implies a specific timing for the event that led to the hypoxic damage.

To assess the likelihood of this timing if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for Ben's condition and whether they could have caused hypoxic damage within the stated timeframe.

1. **Natural Causes or Accidental Events**: If Ben's death was due to natural causes or an accidental event not related to Jane's actions, the timing of the hypoxic damage would depend on the nature of that cause. Some conditions could cause gradual deterioration, while others might result in sudden onset.

2. **SIDS or Other Sudden Deaths**: SIDS, by definition, is sudden and unexpected. However, SIDS typically does not present with significant pathological findings like hypoxic brain damage indicative of a prolonged process.

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause or an accident, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) might still be plausible depending on the cause. However, the presence of significant hypoxic damage hours before death suggests a process that was ongoing and potentially observable.

The key here is whether the medical evidence supports that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death and whether this timing is consistent with alternative explanations for Ben's death.

If the hypoxic damage was indeed caused hours before death, it implies that there was a period where Ben was alive but suffering from the effects of hypoxia. This could potentially have been observable or reported by caregivers.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these coincidences occurring naturally.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies being approximately the same age when they died could be coincidental, given that both were infants and within a similar age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks). The probability of two successive infants dying at roughly the same age is not extremely low, considering that infant mortality, while tragic, is not unheard of, and certain age ranges might be more vulnerable to specific risks.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both dying at a similar time of day after being fed and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them are more specific and less likely to be coincidental. The time of day and the circumstances (just after being fed and being alone with Jane) are specific enough to make the coincidence less probable.

However, if Jane is not guilty, we're considering a scenario where both deaths were due to natural causes or accidents. SIDS, for example, is known for occurring in infants who are seemingly healthy and often happens during sleep or periods of inactivity, which could be after feeding. The fact that both incidents happened when Jane was alone with the babies is a circumstance related to their care and supervision.

The combination of these specific similarities (age, time of day, circumstances) is what makes the coincidence less likely. However, given that Jane was the primary caregiver and both incidents involved her being alone with the babies, some level of similarity in circumstances is not entirely unexpected.

To quantify the likelihood of these specific similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how rare it is for two successive infants in the same family to die under such similar circumstances due to unrelated causes.

The probability that two infants in the same family die of SIDS or other natural causes under such remarkably similar circumstances is very low because SIDS and other natural causes do not typically result in such a pattern.

To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential factors at play.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS can occur at any time during the first year, but it is more common between 1-4 months. The fact that both died at a relatively similar age could be coincidental given that they are siblings and thus share genetic and environmental factors.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both were found after being fed and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is known for its unpredictability. The fact that both incidents happened after feeding and when Jane was alone could be a coincidence or related to the risk factors associated with SIDS or other natural causes.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: Both times, Jane was the one who discovered the babies unconscious. This is not surprising given that she was the primary caregiver and was alone with them at the time.

If Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother the babies), the similarities could be attributed to a combination of factors including coincidence, shared risk factors for SIDS (genetic predisposition, environmental factors), and the natural variability in the timing and circumstances of SIDS.

It's worth noting that SIDS is diagnosed after other causes of death have been ruled out, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of certain risk factors (such as smoking in the household, bed-sharing, or a family history of SIDS) could increase the likelihood of SIDS in both children.

Given that the deaths are being investigated and Jane is charged with murder based on new evidence from autopsies, it suggests that the initial assessment of SIDS or natural causes might have been questioned. However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, the similarities between the two incidents can be seen as unfortunate coincidences or related to shared underlying risk factors.

To quantify the likelihood of these similarities occurring under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is complex and requires a deep dive into statistical analysis of SIDS cases, the specific circumstances of the deaths, and potentially, expert testimony on the likelihood of repeated SIDS in the same family.

However, a key piece of information is that SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000). The probability of it happening twice in the same family is significantly lower, though not impossible. Research suggests that the risk of SIDS in a subsequent sibling is slightly higher than in the general population, but still very low.

Given these considerations, while it's difficult to provide a precise probability without more detailed statistical data, we can still make a reasoned judgment.

The probability judgment is: 20. 

This reflects a low but not impossible likelihood that the similarities between the incidents could occur if Jane is not guilty, taking into account the factors mentioned and the rarity of SIDS. 

20!!
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential explanations for these similarities.

First, let's break down the given similarities:
1. Both babies were about the same age when they died.
2. They both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed.
3. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural or accidental causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as suggested.

1. **Age at Death**: Babies dying of SIDS often do so within the first year, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which, while somewhat similar, isn't extremely uncommon given the overall age range for SIDS.

2. **Time of Day and Recent Feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time. However, the fact that both deaths occurred after feeding and at a similar time of day could be considered coincidental if the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause. There isn't a well-established correlation between feeding and SIDS, but infants are often put to sleep after feeding.

3. **Found Unconscious by Jane**: This is likely due to Jane being the primary caregiver and thus more likely to be with the babies when they are in distress or lifeless. If Jane is not guilty, this similarity is a reflection of her caregiving role rather than any suspicious behavior.

To evaluate the likelihood of these similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we must recognize that some of these factors (like being found by Jane) are circumstantial and related to Jane's role as the caregiver. The more significant factor to consider is whether the other similarities (age at death, time of day, and recent feeding) could occur by chance if both deaths were due to SIDS or another unrelated cause.

Given that SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000), the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare, often cited as being as low as 1 in 100 million or even less likely, though some studies suggest a slightly higher recurrence risk. However, the focus here isn't on the likelihood of two SIDS deaths but rather on the specific circumstances surrounding the deaths.

If we assume both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the specific circumstances (age, time of day, recent feeding) could still occur coincidentally. The probability of the exact age (within a couple of weeks) and the time of day (if we assume a somewhat flexible definition of "similar time of day") and condition (post-feeding) being the same could be considered low but not impossible.

However, quantifying this probability precisely is challenging without specific data on the distribution of these factors in SIDS cases. 

Given the rarity of SIDS and the specific circumstances, while it's not impossible for these similarities to occur by chance, it is somewhat improbable.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of death.

The key similarities are:
1. Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks).
2. They died at a similar time of day after being fed.
3. Jane found them unconscious when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that both deaths could be attributed to natural or accidental causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as suggested.

Let's examine the given similarities in the context of SIDS or other non-foul play explanations:

1. **Age**: SIDS typically occurs within the first year of life, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died within this age range, so their ages at death are consistent with SIDS.

2. **Time of Day and Feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time, and there's no established direct link between feeding and SIDS, although some studies have explored potential associations between feeding practices and SIDS risk. However, infants often sleep after feeding, and since SIDS occurs during sleep, it's plausible that both incidents happened post-feeding due to the natural sleep patterns of infants.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: If both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the fact that Jane discovered them could simply be a result of her being their primary caregiver.

To assess the likelihood of these similarities occurring under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we must consider how probable it is for two SIDS deaths to occur in the same family and to share these specific circumstances.

1. **SIDS Recurrence**: The recurrence risk of SIDS in a family is slightly higher than the general population risk but still relatively low. Studies suggest that the risk after one SIDS death might be somewhat higher than 1 in 4,000, but it's still a rare occurrence.

2. **Similar Circumstances**: The specific circumstances (age, time of day relative to feeding, and being found by Jane) could occur coincidentally if both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause. The fact that Jane was alone with both when they were found is consistent with her role as a primary caregiver.

However, calculating an exact probability of these specific similarities occurring is challenging without precise statistical data on the distribution of these factors in SIDS cases. Nonetheless, we can make a simplified judgment.

Given the rarity of SIDS and its somewhat increased but still rare recurrence risk, the probability that both deaths were SIDS and shared these similarities by coincidence is low but not impossible.

The probability judgment reflecting the likelihood that there are these similarities between both incidents if Jane is NOT GUILTY is: **20**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of the deaths that are not related to Jane's actions (i.e., assuming she is innocent).

First, let's analyze the given information and the similarities:

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is known to occur typically within the first year of life, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Thus, the ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths are within the typical range for SIDS.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and when Jane was alone with them. The fact that both were found unconscious after being put to bed or after feeding could be coincidental or related to the fact that infants spend a lot of time sleeping and being cared for by their primary caregivers, often their mothers.

3. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is considered when other causes of death are ruled out. The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes, which could be compatible with SIDS. The re-examination findings, however, revealed potential signs of trauma. For Ben, the autopsy directly showed signs that were initially interpreted as indicative of non-natural causes.

If Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the similarities could be attributed to various factors:

- **Coincidence and Shared Circumstances**: The babies were of similar ages, and both incidents happened under similar circumstances (e.g., after feeding, when Jane was alone with them). These similarities might not be highly improbable if one considers the routine and patterns of infant care.

- **Environmental or Genetic Factors**: Some research suggests that there might be genetic or environmental factors that increase the risk of SIDS in some families.

To quantify the likelihood of these similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is challenging without directly estimating the probability of SIDS in both cases and the likelihood of the observed similarities given SIDS or another natural cause.

However, we can simplify this by considering the core elements:
- The probability that both deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause.
- The probability of the observed similarities given that both deaths are natural.

SIDS is rare (1 in 4,000), and the probability that two consecutive siblings die from SIDS is extremely low, significantly lower than the simple multiplication of the probability for one child (since it's not independent for siblings), but still, it's considered to be higher than the random chance of murder.

The probability that both incidents show the observed similarities (same age, time of day, found by Jane after being put to bed) by chance, assuming they are not related to Jane's actions, is difficult to quantify directly from the given information. However, it is reasonable to consider that some of these factors (e.g., being found by Jane after being put to bed) are more likely given the routine care of infants.

Given the rarity of SIDS and the specific similarities observed, we might intuitively think the likelihood is low. However, without precise probabilities for each factor and their interdependencies, any exact figure is speculative.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a relatively low likelihood of observing these similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, taking into account the rarity of SIDS and the specific circumstances of the deaths. However, this is a subjective assessment based on the information provided and should be considered in the context of all available evidence.
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we must first understand the given information and the context. The key details are that both babies died at approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks), at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural or accidental causes, with SIDS being a potential explanation mentioned. SIDS is known for being a diagnosis of exclusion, where the death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation.

Let's analyze the given similarities:

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were a few weeks old (11 weeks and 8 weeks), which is within the age range where SIDS can occur. SIDS typically occurs within the first year of life, with a peak incidence between 1 and 4 months.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both were found after being fed and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time, and there's no specific correlation with feeding times, but it's known that SIDS deaths often occur during sleep or periods of reduced vigilance.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: Both times, Jane was the one to discover the babies unwell or deceased. This is a circumstance rather than a characteristic of the death itself but is relevant to understanding the similarity in the events.

For the deaths to be SIDS, certain conditions and risk factors should be considered. While SIDS is more common among boys, and its overall frequency is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, the presence of some risk factors (like sleeping position, exposure to smoke, etc.) isn't directly mentioned. However, the fact that both babies died under similar circumstances (age, time relative to feeding, discovered by Jane) could be coincidental if their deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause.

The probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely low, much lower than the simple probability of one SIDS death, because it involves the conjunction of two rare events. However, the actual probability we're asked to assess isn't directly about the likelihood of SIDS occurring twice but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities if Jane is not guilty.

To simplify, let's consider the probability of the observed similarities under the assumption that Jane is innocent (and thus the deaths are not due to her actions). The critical factor here is the age and the circumstance of being found by Jane. The fact that they both died at a young age and were discovered unresponsive by Jane is influenced by the fact that Jane was their caregiver.

The probability of two infants dying at a similar age by SIDS is low due to its rarity (1 in 4,000). However, the specific circumstances (e.g., being found by Jane after feeding) could be argued to be circumstantial and not directly related to the cause of death.

The probability that both incidents have these similarities (age, time of day relative to feeding, discovered by Jane) if Jane is not guilty involves understanding that these events are not entirely independent. The fact that Jane was the primary caregiver increases the likelihood that she would be the one to discover them.

Given the rarity of SIDS and the specific circumstances, while it's not straightforward to quantify the likelihood of these similarities without making several assumptions, we can still reason that the combination of these specific circumstances occurring twice is low.

However, quantifying this probability requires complex statistical analysis and understanding of the base rates of SIDS and other relevant factors.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the given information.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is known to occur typically within the first year of life, with a peak incidence around 2-4 months. Thus, the ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths are within the range where SIDS could be considered a possible cause.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and were discovered by Jane when she was alone with them. The time of day for SIDS deaths can vary, but they often occur during sleep or periods of rest.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: The fact that Jane discovered both babies unconscious is a circumstance that could happen given that she was the primary caregiver and was alone with them at the times of their deaths.

If Jane is not guilty (i.e., if the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause), the similarities in the circumstances could be attributed to several factors:
- Both children were of an age susceptible to SIDS.
- The feeding and sleep patterns of infants are somewhat predictable and could naturally lead to similarities in the circumstances surrounding their deaths if both were put to bed or left to rest after feeding.
- As the primary caregiver, it is plausible that Jane was alone with both children at the times they died, given typical parental roles.

However, the probability that both deaths would share several specific similarities (age, time relative to feeding, discovered by Jane) by chance, even if they were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, is influenced by how common these specific circumstances are among SIDS cases.

SIDS is, by definition, unexplained, but certain risk factors and common circumstances have been observed (e.g., age, sleep environment). If we consider that the specific set of circumstances (age, time of day relative to feeding, discovered by the same person) is not extremely rare among SIDS cases, the occurrence of these similarities could be plausible without requiring Jane to be guilty.

However, without precise statistical data on the frequency of these exact circumstances in SIDS cases, we can still reason that if Jane is not guilty, the similarities are largely a result of her being the primary caregiver and the natural patterns of infant care and SIDS incidence.

To quantify this, let's consider that the circumstances (e.g., being found after feeding, alone with Jane) might not be extremely rare in infant deaths, especially if we are considering a scenario where both deaths are due to natural causes like SIDS.

The key is understanding that while the exact probability is difficult to quantify without specific statistical data on the distribution of circumstances surrounding SIDS deaths, the scenario provided suggests that there are plausible explanations for the similarities that do not require Jane's guilt.

Thus, while it's challenging to assign an exact probability, we can say that if Jane is not guilty, there are reasonable explanations for the observed similarities that align with the natural patterns and circumstances of infant care.

60
If Jane is not guilty, we are considering a scenario where Ben's death is due to natural causes, potentially SIDS. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, as indicated by the autopsy, suggests that there was a period of reduced oxygen supply to the brain before death.

SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature, and while the exact mechanisms leading to SIDS are not fully understood, research has suggested that some infants who die from SIDS may have experienced some level of hypoxia or other physiological stressors before death.

However, the specific timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred relative to death is critical. If the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, it implies a process or event that led to reduced oxygenation of the brain, which then culminated in death.

For SIDS or other natural causes, the expectation is that the process leading to death might be more immediate or related to an underlying vulnerability rather than a distinct event occurring "a matter of hours before death." The pathology findings in SIDS can sometimes indicate prior hypoxia or stress, but the timing and nature of such events are not typically characterized as happening a few hours before death in a straightforward manner.

The medical expert's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have occurred a matter of hours before death implies a specific timeline that may not be typical for SIDS or other natural causes of death in infants. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, as alleged, is relatively low because SIDS typically does not have a clearly identifiable timeline of hypoxic damage preceding death by hours.

20
If Jane is not guilty, we are considering a scenario where Andy's death is due to natural causes, potentially SIDS. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, as found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs, are indicative of trauma.

While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is characterized by a lack of clear explanation for the death, certain findings like those mentioned (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are typically not associated with SIDS. These findings are more commonly associated with trauma or abuse.

The presence of such injuries in an infant who died supposedly from SIDS would be considered unusual and not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with significant trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of finding these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other natural infant deaths.

Thus, the presence of these injuries in Andy, if Jane is not guilty, would be considered an unlikely coincidence.

10
If Jane is not guilty, we are considering a scenario where Ben's death is due to natural causes, potentially SIDS. However, the specific findings of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not typical for SIDS.

SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some infants who die from SIDS may have certain pathological findings, the presence of hypoxic damage and, particularly, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not characteristic of SIDS and are more indicative of trauma or another form of stress that is not typically associated with SIDS.

The presence of these findings suggests that Ben's death might not have been due to SIDS or another natural cause but could be indicative of some form of trauma or asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other natural infant deaths.

Therefore, the presence of these findings in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, is unlikely.

## Step 1: Understand the given case and the condition of Ben's autopsy findings.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the autopsy of Ben showing hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are suggested to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation provided - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the autopsy findings of Ben in the context of SIDS.
While SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism, certain autopsy findings can be associated with or distinguished from SIDS. Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are not typical characteristics used to define SIDS; instead, SIDS is often diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben could be due to other reasons or conditions. However, the question is whether these findings can occur in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

## Step 5: Assess the relationship between the autopsy findings and potential causes.
Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can be associated with various conditions, not just smothering. However, in the context of an infant's death, such findings are often scrutinized for signs of trauma or asphyxia.

## Step 6: Consider the possibility of these findings occurring naturally or due to other causes.
While SIDS is by definition unexplained, certain pathological findings like significant hypoxic damage or haemorrhages might not be typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as they suggest a possible cause or mechanism (e.g., asphyxia).

## Step 7: Determine the likelihood based on the given information and the condition that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the deaths could be attributed to other causes, including SIDS or other natural or accidental causes. However, the specific autopsy findings in Ben (and the re-evaluated findings in Andy) suggest a possible non-natural cause.

## Step 8: Evaluate the probability of the autopsy findings occurring without Jane being guilty.
Given that the autopsy findings are indicative of possible asphyxia or trauma, if Jane is not guilty, these findings would need to be explained by other means. The likelihood of such significant pathological changes occurring without any foul play (e.g., due to an accidental cause or a rare natural condition) is considered.

## Step 9: Assess the probability.
The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not characteristic of typical SIDS cases. While it's possible for infants to suffer from conditions leading to such findings, the context here (charges of murder by smothering) suggests these findings are significant. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider alternative explanations for these findings, which could include accidental asphyxia or other rare conditions.

## Step 10: Provide a probability judgment.
Considering that hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are not typical for SIDS and could indicate asphyxia or trauma, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings would depend on whether there are plausible alternative explanations. However, given the specific context and findings, the probability that these occurred without any intentional act (like smothering) by Jane is relatively low because such findings are often associated with non-natural deaths.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. In the context of the case, these findings are presented as evidence of smothering or other violent trauma.

2. **Alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are other plausible explanations for these findings that are not related to smothering or violent trauma inflicted by Jane.

   - **SIDS or other natural causes**: SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, the presence of specific injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) is not typically characteristic of SIDS, as SIDS is defined by the lack of a clear cause of death after thorough investigation. While the initial presentation of Ben might have been thought to be SIDS, the autopsy findings suggest otherwise.
   
   - **Accidental causes**: Other accidental causes could potentially lead to hypoxia or trauma. However, the specific pattern of injuries described is more suggestive of a violent or smothering event rather than an accidental injury or SIDS.

3. **Assessing likelihood**: Given that the autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS or other natural causes and are more indicative of trauma or smothering, if Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other extremely rare or unlikely scenarios that could cause such injuries without being related to Jane's actions.

4. **Rare conditions or misinterpretation**: It's theoretically possible, though highly unlikely, that there was a rare medical condition or a misinterpretation of the autopsy findings. However, the detailed nature of the injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) suggests a significant event rather than a misdiagnosis or rare condition that could easily explain these specific findings.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being due to some other cause is low because the described injuries are more indicative of a significant traumatic event.

**Probability judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. In the context of a baby, these findings can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are other plausible causes for these findings. SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature and lack of clear evidence of trauma or asphyxia upon autopsy.

3. **SIDS and Autopsy Findings**: The autopsy findings in Ben's case, including hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when other causes of death are ruled out. The presence of significant autopsy findings like those in Ben's case usually leads to a conclusion other than SIDS.

4. **Other Accidental or Natural Causes**: While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental asphyxia or other conditions leading to hypoxic damage, the specific constellation of findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic brain damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, and eye hemorrhages) is highly suggestive of a non-accidental injury in the absence of a clear accidental mechanism (like a documented unsafe sleep environment or an witnessed event).

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the autopsy findings in Ben to be explained by an alternative cause, there would need to be another plausible explanation. SIDS or other natural causes are unlikely given the specific findings. Accidental causes could potentially explain some findings, but the severity and combination of injuries described are unusual for an accidental or natural cause in an infant.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages being present due to another cause is low. This is because the findings are strongly suggestive of a non-natural cause, and if Jane is innocent, another perpetrator or a highly unusual accidental or natural cause would need to be considered.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) would occur if Jane is not guilty, acknowledging that while not impossible, alternative innocent explanations are not strongly supported by the described evidence. 

**20**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her. Given that the autopsy findings on Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings if Jane is not guilty.

One alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or mechanism for the death, and it does not typically present with specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids indicative of trauma.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS, it is less likely to be associated with the specific autopsy findings observed. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages more typically suggests an event that led to asphyxiation or significant stress, which is not characteristic of SIDS.

However, it's also possible that the observed injuries could be the result of other, non-criminal factors or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings. 

Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative cause of death that could potentially explain the observed autopsy findings, we need to assess the likelihood of these findings occurring without smothering or violent trauma.

SIDS or other natural causes might not directly explain the specific injuries found. However, it's known that some SIDS cases may have underlying vulnerabilities or conditions that could potentially lead to or mimic some of the observed autopsy findings.

The probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are due to other causes (not smothering or violent trauma by Jane) is difficult to quantify directly from the given information but considering SIDS or other non-traumatic causes, it's relatively low because the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, given Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred without smothering or other violent trauma is low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. The given condition is that Jane is not guilty, implying that the death and injuries to Ben (and Andy) were not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by Jane.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen, which can occur due to various reasons including but not limited to smothering. Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be associated with trauma or increased pressure in the veins due to other causes.

2. **Alternative Causes for the Findings**: 
   - **SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages could be indicative of a severe health issue or a catastrophic event not related to smothering. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of significant autopsy findings like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages makes SIDS less likely as the sole explanation, as SIDS typically does not present with such clear pathological evidence of trauma or asphyxia.
   - **Accidental or Other Causes**: There could be other explanations for the observed injuries, such as an undiagnosed medical condition or an accidental cause. However, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is often associated with asphyxial events.

3. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother the children. The injuries found on Ben could be due to other causes. However, the described autopsy findings are highly suggestive of asphyxia or a similar catastrophic event. If Jane is not guilty, one has to consider other potential causes for these findings. 

Given the presence of significant pathological findings that are often associated with asphyxia or violent trauma, and assuming Jane's innocence, the likelihood that these findings occurred naturally or by accident (not due to smothering or similar intentional act by Jane) is relatively low, because these specific findings are not typical for SIDS or other natural causes. However, there could be other explanations that are not related to Jane's actions.

**60**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) and hemorrhages (bleeding) in the context of an infant's death can be indicative of several conditions, not just smothering or violent trauma. 

1. **Hypoxic Damage to the Brain**: This can occur due to various reasons such as suffocation, but also due to other medical conditions or accidents that result in the infant not getting enough oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, other potential causes for hypoxic damage need to be considered.

2. **Haemorrhages to the Eyes and Eyelids**: These can be associated with trauma or increased pressure during a medical event leading to death. However, they can also be seen in other conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the deaths could be SIDS or another medical condition. SIDS is, by definition, a diagnosis of exclusion made when other causes of death are ruled out. The presence of significant hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, however, makes SIDS less likely as SIDS does not typically present with such clear signs of hypoxia or trauma.

However, it's crucial to differentiate between the possibility of SIDS and the presence of these specific autopsy findings. Infants who die from SIDS may occasionally have some minor pathological findings, but significant hypoxic damage and hemorrhages as described are not typical for SIDS.

Other rare medical conditions could potentially cause some of these findings, but they are not commonly associated with SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying that the cause of death might not be smothering or violent trauma by her), the likelihood of the specific autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) being due to another cause is lower, given that they are more commonly associated with some form of trauma or smothering. However, it's not impossible that a rare medical condition or an accident could result in such findings.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, we're left to consider the likelihood of these specific findings occurring without smothering or violent trauma. While there are rare conditions that could potentially explain some of these findings, they are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes.

Thus, considering the specifics of the case and the information given, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are due to a cause other than smothering or violent trauma is relatively low, given the nature of the findings.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information states that Jane is charged with murdering her two sons by smothering them. The autopsy findings for Ben include hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider other possible causes for these findings.

One alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause or evidence of trauma upon autopsy. The autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when other causes are ruled out and there's an absence of significant pathological findings indicating trauma or other cause of death.

Other potential explanations could involve accidental or non-traumatic causes for the observed autopsy findings. However, the specific findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are more commonly associated with asphyxia or trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be explained by other than smothering or violent trauma, there would need to be another plausible cause. Some natural conditions or accidental events could potentially result in similar autopsy findings, but they are not commonly associated with the pattern described for Ben.

The key here is understanding that the prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation of these autopsy findings as indicative of smothering or other forms of violent trauma. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider that these findings might have an alternative, non-criminal explanation.

However, given the specific nature of the findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it's challenging to attribute them to SIDS or other non-traumatic causes without contradicting the typical understanding of these conditions. 

Thus, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurred without smothering or violent trauma is low because they are not characteristic of typical SIDS or other non-traumatic causes.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of violent trauma inflicted by her.

The hypoxic damage and haemorrhages found in Ben are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and significant stress or trauma. While these findings are consistent with smothering, they can also be associated with other medical conditions or accidents that result in hypoxia.

If Jane is not guilty, several possibilities could explain the observed injuries:
1. **Accidental or Natural Causes**: There could be rare medical conditions or accidental circumstances that led to the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages. However, the presence of specific injuries like those described (especially if they are deemed to be non-accidental in nature by medical experts) might be less likely to be explained by common accidental or natural causes.

2. **SIDS or Other Unexplained Causes**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not typically associated with the specific pathological findings described for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids). While SIDS is a possible explanation for sudden infant death, the presence of these specific findings makes it less likely as SIDS does not typically present with such clear signs of hypoxia or trauma.

3. **Other Causes or Misinterpretation**: There might be other, less common causes for the observed findings, or there could be a misinterpretation of the autopsy results. However, the detailed nature of the findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) suggests a significant event.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to be consistent with an alternative explanation, there would need to be a plausible alternative cause. The described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS, which is more of an exclusionary diagnosis and doesn't directly cause such specific traumatic or hypoxic changes.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred due to some other cause is relatively low, given that these findings are suggestive of a significant and traumatic event. However, without more information on alternative explanations or the exact nature and interpretation of these findings by medical experts, quantifying this likelihood precisely is challenging.

Given the context provided and understanding that the described injuries are not typical for SIDS or common natural causes, and assuming that the medical evidence is robust and correctly interpreted:

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. In the context of infant death, these findings can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are other plausible explanations for these findings that do not involve smothering or violent trauma by her or anyone else.

3. **SIDS consideration**: The question suggests SIDS as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infancy, and by definition, it doesn't typically present with significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings suggest a more complex or traumatic cause of death rather than SIDS alone.

4. **Other causes of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages**: There could be other medical or accidental causes for hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, such as an accident causing asphyxia or an underlying medical condition leading to these symptoms. However, given the context of the case, these would be considered rare and would need specific evidence to support them.

5. **Likelihood assessment**: Given that the findings are indicative of smothering or trauma and not typical for SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (implying the death was not due to her actions), we still need to explain the presence of these significant pathological findings.

Since SIDS is not typically associated with such clear signs of hypoxia or trauma, and assuming Jane's innocence implies that the death was not due to smothering by her, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring naturally or due to another non-traumatic cause is low.

However, it's not zero because there could be rare conditions or other explanations. Without more specific information on alternative causes, we lean on understanding that these findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

Given the information and focusing on the requirement to assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering her children), we need to consider that these specific autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS or natural causes.

The probability judgment for the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, given Jane is not guilty, should reflect the unlikeliness of these findings occurring without a traumatic or smothering cause.

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that the findings are indicative of smothering or other violent trauma according to the prosecution's case. However, if Jane is not guilty, we have to consider other possible causes for these injuries.

1. **Alternative Causes for Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons not related to smothering, such as severe respiratory infections, congenital conditions affecting breathing, or accidental asphyxia not related to smothering (e.g., getting entangled in bedding in a way that obstructs breathing, though this is more likely to be associated with SIDS risk factors rather than the specific injuries described). Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be caused by various factors including accidental trauma, but in the context of infant death, it raises suspicion of non-accidental injury.

2. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: The question mentions SIDS as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion made when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as seen in Ben, would typically not be characteristic of SIDS. SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.

3. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death and injuries to Ben could be due to other causes. However, given that the specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma rather than SIDS or other natural causes, we need to consider how likely these could occur naturally or accidentally.

Given the specific nature of the injuries (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) that are more aligned with asphyxiation or trauma, if Jane is not guilty (implying the absence of smothering or intentional harm), the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low because they are not typical for SIDS or common accidental injuries.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to natural or accidental causes not related to smothering or violent trauma is low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, respectively. These findings can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider other possible causes for these observed injuries. SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages typically leads investigators to look beyond SIDS as an explanation.

3. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
   - Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are generally associated with some form of asphyxia or trauma. 
   - SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings indicative of asphyxia or trauma. The pathology described is more aligned with a violent or traumatic cause of death rather than SIDS.

4. **Considering Other Causes**: Other potential causes for the observed injuries could include accidental asphyxia or other traumatic events. However, the scenario provided does not detail other potential causes or evidence of accidental injury.

5. **Assessing Probability**: Given that Jane is not guilty, for the observed injuries to be present, there must be another explanation. Since SIDS is not typically associated with the specific pathological findings described for Ben, and assuming no other evidence of external trauma or accident, the likelihood that these findings occurred without Jane being guilty (and thus potentially being due to some other, unexplained or accidental cause) is low.

However, the exact probability depends on various factors including the thoroughness of the investigation into other potential causes of death, the presence of any other evidence that might support or refute Jane's guilt, and the rarity or plausibility of alternative explanations.

Given the information and focusing on the specific question, if Jane is not guilty, the described injuries would be unexpected under the context of SIDS or other non-traumatic, non-homicidal causes.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The prosecution's case hinges on the evidence of injuries found in both Andy and Ben, which they attribute to smothering or other forms of violent trauma.

The findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and potential trauma. While these findings can be consistent with smothering, they are not exclusive to it. Other conditions or accidental events could potentially lead to similar outcomes.

However, given the context that these specific injuries are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or smothering, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely these injuries are under the alternative explanation of SIDS or another natural/accidental cause.

SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion made when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage and hemorrhages would typically rule out SIDS as these are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is generally considered to be a diagnosis where the autopsy and investigation are negative for a cause of death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to smothering or violent trauma caused by her), the presence of these specific injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) would be unexpected under the hypothesis of SIDS or another natural cause, as these are not typical of SIDS.

However, it's also important to consider that there could be other rare natural or accidental causes that might result in similar pathological findings. For instance, an undiagnosed medical condition or an accidental event leading to asphyxiation could potentially cause hypoxic damage.

Given the specifics of the case and the information provided, the likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) if Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering her children) is relatively low because these findings are not typical of SIDS and suggest a more complex or traumatic cause of death.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information:
1. The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.
2. These findings are stated to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.
3. Jane is charged with murdering both children by smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, we have to consider other possible causes for Ben's condition:
- The possibility that Ben died from SIDS or another natural cause.
- The possibility that Ben's death was due to an accident or another form of non-violent or non-criminal cause.
- The possibility that someone or something else caused the injuries (though this is not directly stated, it's an implication of considering Jane not guilty).

The key issue here is whether the autopsy findings can be explained by something other than smothering or violent trauma inflicted by Jane.

1. **SIDS**: The provided definition states that SIDS is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. SIDS is not typically associated with specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage or haemorrhages unless there's an underlying condition that could cause such findings. However, SIDS is generally diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

2. **Other Causes**: Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can result from various conditions, not just smothering. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental injuries could potentially cause such findings.

However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) described is particularly indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) potentially caused by asphyxiation or smothering. Other causes could potentially lead to hypoxia, but they might not necessarily result in the exact pattern of injuries described.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we're essentially evaluating the likelihood that these specific autopsy findings occurred without smothering by Jane. 

If we consider alternative causes for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages (e.g., accidental asphyxia, other medical conditions leading to hypoxia), it's still a complex task because the exact cause of such specific injuries isn't directly related to SIDS.

However, the detailed autopsy findings suggest a traumatic or asphyxial cause rather than a natural one like SIDS. SIDS, by definition, doesn't have an explained cause and typically doesn't present with such specific pathological findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate and not misinterpreted, there must be another explanation for these findings.

The likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring without Jane being guilty (i.e., without her smothering Ben) hinges on alternative explanations that could result in similar autopsy findings. While it's not impossible that other causes could result in similar findings, the described pattern is highly suggestive of asphyxia or smothering.

Thus, given that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low, given the specificity of the autopsy results pointing towards asphyxia or a similar mechanism.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben upon autopsy. The findings include hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. In that case, we need to consider other possible causes for the observed injuries and conditions.

1. **Alternative Causes for Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages can result from various causes, not just smothering. For instance, a severe infection, a congenital condition, or an accidental injury could potentially lead to similar findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries described is often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or smothering.

2. **SIDS as an Explanation**: The scenario also suggests SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings. While SIDS can result in some minor pathological changes, the extensive injuries described for Ben (and later found in Andy's re-examination) are not typical of SIDS. SIDS does not usually cause significant hypoxic damage or hemorrhages as seen in Ben.

3. **Likelihood of Alternative Causes**: For Ben's condition to be explained by an alternative cause (other than smothering by Jane), there would need to be a plausible medical or accidental explanation that results in similar autopsy findings. Given the nature of the injuries (hypoxic damage, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it is challenging to attribute them to SIDS or a simple accidental cause without other evidence.

However, it's also worth noting that the presence of such significant and specific injuries in two siblings raises suspicions of a non-accidental cause. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other potential perpetrators or accidental causes, but the detailed pattern of injury is less likely to be due to an accident or a condition like SIDS.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred by chance or due to another cause is relatively low because these findings are not characteristic of SIDS or common accidental injuries in infants.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information suggests that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the death of both Andy and Ben could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the specific autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and the re-examination findings for Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of a non-natural cause of death, typically associated with smothering or other forms of trauma.

SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with significant autopsy findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were due to a natural or accidental cause rather than smothering or other violent trauma by her), the likelihood of Ben having hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids due to SIDS or another natural cause is low. These findings are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause rather than SIDS.

However, there are other potential causes for such findings, though they are not SIDS. For instance, accidental or non-intentional actions leading to asphyxia or other forms of infant maltreatment could potentially result in similar autopsy findings. Yet, given the specific context that these findings are being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we're examining the possibility that these could occur without her intentional act.

The probability that Ben's autopsy findings are due to natural or non-criminal causes (in line with Jane not being guilty) would be considered low due to the nature of the findings.

Probability judgment: 5
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Andy was not due to her actions, such as smothering or other forms of abuse. The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of non-accidental injury and are often associated with child abuse or smothering.

For these specific injuries to be present in Andy without Jane being guilty, there would need to be an alternative explanation. However, these types of injuries are typically considered to be highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma. 

One possible alternative explanation could be an accident or another form of unintentional injury, but the combination and nature of these injuries make this less likely. Another caregiver or individual causing these injuries could be a possibility if Jane is not guilty, but this would still imply some form of maltreatment or abuse.

SIDS, as mentioned earlier, is not typically associated with such significant pathological findings indicative of trauma. The presence of these injuries makes it less likely that Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring due to other non-criminal or accidental causes is low, given the nature and combination of the findings.

Probability judgment: 5
If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents occurring by chance or due to other factors needs to be considered.

The similarities mentioned include the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died (after being fed), and that Jane was alone with them when they were found unconscious. 

SIDS is known to occur more frequently in certain conditions and at certain ages, typically within the first year of life, with a peak around 2-4 months. Both Andy and Ben were within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which, while somewhat similar, is not unusually so given that both were infants.

The fact that both babies died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them could be related to various factors, including the circumstances of infant care and the likelihood of the caregiver being present when the infant is unwell or dies.

However, the coincidence of these specific circumstances (age, time relative to feeding, and being found by Jane while alone with her) in two consecutive infants is noteworthy. If Jane is not guilty, one might consider that these similarities could be due to chance or to some other underlying factor not related to Jane's actions.

The probability of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family is extremely low, given the already low incidence of SIDS (1 in 4,000 in the UK). However, the specific circumstances surrounding the deaths (e.g., being found by Jane after feeding) might not be directly related to the cause of death (SIDS or otherwise).

Given these considerations, while the overall probability of two SIDS deaths in one family is very low, the specific similarities mentioned could be considered in the context of other factors.

The probability that these similarities occur by chance, given that Jane is not guilty (and thus assuming both deaths are not due to her actions), is still relatively low but is complicated by the fact that some of these factors (like being found by Jane) are circumstantial.

Probability judgment: 20
The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and understanding of how hypoxic damage typically evolves.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not a result of her intentional actions, such as smothering. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing are medical facts that can be assessed independently of Jane's guilt or innocence.

The key question is whether the hypoxic damage could have occurred a matter of hours before death due to circumstances other than Jane's intentional actions. If Ben suffered from a medical condition or an accidental event that caused hypoxia (lack of oxygen), it's possible that this could have occurred hours before death.

However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) is a medical judgment. If the medical evidence supports that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death, this would be a factual determination rather than one directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death depends on the medical evidence and expert interpretation. The fact that Jane is not guilty does not directly affect the timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred; it's about whether there was another plausible explanation for the damage.

Given that the medical evidence and expert testimony are crucial here, and assuming the doctor's allegation is based on a sound medical understanding, the probability judgment would reflect the likelihood that the medical assessment is correct.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids given that Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) and haemorrhages (bleeding) in the eyes and eyelids can be associated with various conditions, not just smothering or violent trauma. However, in the context given, these findings are initially linked to smothering or other forms of violent trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or other violent acts by her). There are a few scenarios to consider:

1. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: The question suggests SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of explanatory findings upon autopsy. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (meaning other causes of death must be ruled out), significant findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages are not typical for SIDS.

2. **Accidental Causes or Other Medical Conditions**: There could be other reasons for the observed injuries and hypoxic damage, such as accidental trauma or certain medical conditions. However, the specific findings mentioned (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical for most accidental injuries or common medical conditions in infants without a history of specific risk factors or conditions that could cause such damage.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be explained, there would need to be another plausible cause. While it's possible that there could be an undiagnosed medical condition or an accidental cause that led to these findings, the described autopsy results are more typically associated with some form of trauma or asphyxia.

Thus, given Jane's innocence (implying no smothering or violent trauma by her), the likelihood of the specific autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) being due to other causes is relatively low, as these are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

The key information given is that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the death of both Andy and Ben could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are mentioned to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, and it does not typically present with specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage or haemorrhages that are indicative of trauma or smothering. While SIDS can sometimes be associated with some pathological findings, the presence of significant trauma or smothering indicators is not characteristic of SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), the likelihood of the specific autopsy findings in Ben (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) being present due to SIDS or another non-traumatic cause is low. These findings are more indicative of a traumatic or violent cause rather than SIDS.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, it is unlikely that Ben would have the specific autopsy findings described.

The probability judgment is: 20 

(This judgment reflects that while it's not impossible for SIDS or another condition to potentially cause or be associated with some similar findings, the described injuries are more typically associated with trauma. However, without specific evidence or expert testimony ruling out other causes entirely, there's a small chance that alternative explanations could be considered.)

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The question then is whether the observed injuries and conditions in Ben could occur through other means or be explained by another condition such as SIDS.

The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. While these can be associated with smothering, they are not exclusive to it. Other causes could potentially lead to similar findings, such as accidental asphyxia, other forms of trauma, or even certain medical conditions.

However, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is highly suggestive of a severe and acute event that resulted in significant distress or trauma to the infant.

SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion where no cause of death can be found after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is not typical for a SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS implies an absence of such findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother Ben), the presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) would be unusual and not easily explained by SIDS or other benign causes. These findings suggest a significant and potentially traumatic event.

Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Ben's hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred due to another cause or were misinterpreted is low, because the described autopsy findings are not characteristic of SIDS and suggest a more complex or traumatic cause.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. The primary alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplainable nature. The given autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are typically associated with smothering or other forms of violent trauma rather than SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not expected to show such overt signs of trauma or asphyxia.

However, it's crucial to consider that some infants who die from SIDS may have incidental or agonal (related to the process of dying) findings that could be misinterpreted as traumatic. Nonetheless, the specific findings described for Ben are not typical for SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or other violent trauma inflicted by her. For the autopsy findings to be consistent with this scenario, there would need to be an alternative explanation that could account for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages observed.

Some natural conditions or accidents could potentially cause similar findings, but they are rare and usually have other supporting evidence (e.g., a clear accidental cause). SIDS itself is not typically associated with such significant pathological findings indicative of asphyxia or trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions would be considered low, given that these are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma.

The probability judgment reflecting the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty is: **20**

This reflects the low likelihood that such specific and significant pathological findings would occur in the absence of foul play or trauma, considering SIDS or other natural causes are less likely to present with these characteristics.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben is attributed to smothering or other violent trauma according to the prosecution's case. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider other possible causes for these injuries.

1. **Alternative Causes for Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage can result from various causes that lead to a lack of oxygen to the brain, not just smothering. These can include severe respiratory infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxia not related to smothering (e.g., unsafe sleeping environments). Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can occur due to various reasons, including trauma, but also potentially due to the physiological stress of dying or other medical conditions.

2. **SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. While SIDS itself doesn't explain the specific findings of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages directly, the underlying cause of death in SIDS cases can sometimes involve elements that might mimic or be misinterpreted as smothering or trauma, though this is highly debated and not a clear consensus.

3. **Interpretation of Autopsy Findings**: The findings could be due to other, non-criminal factors or misinterpretation of the autopsy results. For instance, some research suggests that certain resuscitation practices could potentially cause some of the observed injuries.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present without her causing them through smothering or another form of violent trauma, there needs to be another plausible explanation. While the exact cause might be uncertain, the presence of such significant trauma (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) is not typical for SIDS. SIDS is generally not associated with such clear signs of trauma or asphyxia.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages are due to other, non-criminal causes, is lower than if they were directly attributed to smothering or trauma, because the autopsy findings are quite specific and suggestive of a traumatic or asphyxial cause.

The probability judgment that these findings occur if Jane is not guilty is relatively low, as the described injuries are not typical for the usual alternative explanations like SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanations for these findings, primarily the possibility of SIDS or other natural causes.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage (indicating a lack of sufficient oxygen) to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are significant findings. These are often associated with asphyxia or smothering, which implies a lack of oxygen due to external obstruction of the airway. However, they can also be seen in other conditions.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. However, the presence of specific injuries (like those found in Ben and retrospectively in Andy) typically rules out SIDS as these findings suggest a possible traumatic or violent cause.

3. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother the children. For the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present without Jane being guilty, there would need to be another explanation. SIDS is not typically associated with such specific traumatic injuries. Other natural causes or accidents could potentially lead to hypoxic damage but would be unusual to cause the exact pattern seen in Ben without a clear accidental mechanism (e.g., a documented unsafe sleep environment or other specific accidental asphyxia).

4. **Evaluating Probability**: The injuries described (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are not usually associated with the level of trauma or specific findings like those described for Ben. If Jane is not guilty, one would need to consider other rare or alternative explanations for these findings, such as an undiagnosed medical condition or an accidental cause that mimics smothering.

Given the information and focusing on the specifics of the case:

- The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is more indicative of asphyxia or trauma than SIDS.
- If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings occurred without her causing them (i.e., due to another cause) is low because the findings are not typical of SIDS or most natural causes.

Therefore, considering the nature of the injuries and the context provided, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to another cause is relatively low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information states that Jane is charged with murdering her two sons by smothering them. The autopsy findings for Ben include hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are suggested to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, such as smothering. There are a few possibilities to consider in this context:

1. **SIDS or other natural causes**: The passage mentions SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, the autopsy findings for Ben, particularly the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are not typically characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out, and it is not usually associated with significant pathological findings like those described for Ben.

2. **Other accidental or natural causes**: Other conditions or accidents could potentially cause similar findings. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidents leading to asphyxia or trauma could result in hypoxic damage and hemorrhages.

However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) described for Ben is more typically associated with asphyxial or traumatic deaths rather than SIDS or most other natural causes.

If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be likely, there would need to be another plausible explanation for these findings that does not involve intentional harm by Jane. 

Given the information and the context that such specific injuries are not typical for SIDS and are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings occurred by chance or due to another non-criminal cause is relatively low.

But, to directly answer the question: If Jane is not guilty, the probability that Ben's autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are due to some other cause is still a possibility but seems less likely given their association with smothering or violent trauma.

Given that we are considering a scenario where Jane is not guilty, we must assess the likelihood of these findings occurring without her being responsible. However, the direct causal link or alternative explanations that are as plausible as smothering are not clearly outlined in the given information.

Therefore, based on the provided context and understanding that the described injuries are indicative of a potentially violent or asphyxial cause, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to another cause is not very high, because they strongly suggest a non-natural death.

**20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information states that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death was not due to smothering or other violent acts by her.

There are a few considerations to take into account:

1. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, one alternative explanation could be SIDS or other natural causes. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, as seen in Ben's autopsy, is not typically characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy.

2. **Other Causes for Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can result from various causes, not just smothering or violent trauma. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental injuries could potentially lead to such findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is highly suggestive of asphyxia or smothering.

3. **Re-evaluation of Evidence**: If Jane is not guilty, it suggests that the observed injuries could either be due to another cause or misinterpreted. However, the detailed nature of the autopsy findings for Ben (and the re-evaluation of Andy's autopsy photographs) makes it less likely that these are entirely misinterpreted or due to natural causes like SIDS.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage and haemorrhages occurred by chance or due to an alternative non-criminal cause is low because these findings are strongly indicative of asphyxia or smothering. However, it is not impossible that there could be other rare or unforeseen medical explanations.

Therefore, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because they are strongly associated with smothering or violent trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To address this question, we first need to understand the given information and the condition of Ben's death as described. Ben, the second son of Jane and Frank, was found unwell and later pronounced dead. The autopsy revealed several critical findings: injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The question posits that if Jane is not guilty, we need to assess the likelihood of the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. 

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible asphyxiation or smothering. These findings are often associated with violent or non-accidental injury in the context of infant deaths.

2. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we're considering that the deaths might not be due to smothering or violent trauma caused by her. An alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

3. **SIDS and the Autopsy Findings**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden, unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life. While the exact cause of SIDS remains unknown, the autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when all other possible causes of death are ruled out, and it doesn't usually present with significant pathological findings like those observed in Ben.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is more suggestive of asphyxia or a violent cause rather than SIDS. If Jane is not guilty (implying the death was not due to her actions), we must consider how likely these findings are under the alternative explanation (e.g., SIDS or another accidental cause). However, the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to SIDS or another non-violent cause, the likelihood of observing the specific autopsy findings in Ben (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) would be low because these findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical for SIDS. SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.

The hypoxic damage and haemorrhages found in Ben are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and are consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxia. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death was not a result of her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or other violent trauma inflicted by her).

However, there are other, less common conditions or accidental events that could potentially cause similar findings. For example, accidental asphyxia or other medical conditions could potentially lead to hypoxic damage. Nonetheless, the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is highly suggestive of asphyxia or smothering.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be explained by other causes, there would need to be an alternative explanation that is not related to her actions. While it's possible that such findings could result from other rare conditions or accidents, the described autopsy results are more directly associated with asphyxial injury than with SIDS or most other natural causes.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the injuries were not inflicted by her), the likelihood of the observed hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages being due to another cause is relatively low, because the pattern of injury strongly suggests asphyxia or a similar form of trauma.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, primarily the possibility that both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, and evaluate if these conditions could result in the observed injuries.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or stress on the body, which could be due to smothering or another form of asphyxia.

2. **SIDS and the Observed Injuries**: SIDS is diagnosed when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. By definition, SIDS does not have a clear cause or identifiable pathophysiological features that would explain the death. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages typically suggests an underlying cause or mechanism for the death, which might not be consistent with a diagnosis of SIDS.

3. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found on Ben (and retrospectively on Andy) need an alternative explanation. SIDS is less likely to be the direct cause of death for Ben given the specific injuries described, as these suggest some form of trauma or asphyxia rather than an unexplained natural death.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: Given the specific injuries (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages), if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions like smothering), we are left to consider how likely these findings are under the hypothesis that the deaths were due to natural causes or accidents not related to Jane's actions.

The injuries described for Ben are not typical for SIDS. While SIDS can occur in families more than once (though the risk is still very low), the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is not characteristic of SIDS. These findings suggest some form of asphyxia or trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring due to natural causes or non-criminal accidents is low because they suggest an underlying cause that is not typical for SIDS or other natural infant deaths.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

(This indicates that if Jane is not guilty, there's still a relatively low probability that the observed injuries to Ben would occur naturally or by accident, given the implication that the injuries are more aligned with some form of asphyxia or trauma rather than a natural cause like SIDS.)
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. In the context of an infant's death, these findings are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the death of Ben (and Andy) would likely be attributed to another cause. The given alternative explanation is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. 

3. **SIDS and the Autopsy Findings**: The autopsy findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and the re-examination findings in Andy's case (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is not characterized by specific pathological findings; instead, it's a diagnosis made when the death is unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

4. **Likelihood of Findings if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. However, the specific autopsy findings in Ben (and the re-evaluated findings in Andy) are not characteristic of SIDS. They suggest a possible asphyxial event or trauma. 

Given that SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological changes indicative of asphyxia or trauma, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions like smothering), the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring due to another cause (like SIDS or an accidental asphyxial event not caused by Jane) is low. 

However, there's a possibility, albeit small, that such findings could be the result of an undetermined accidental cause or a rare condition mimicking smothering without actual smothering having occurred.

The probability judgment, on a scale of 0 to 100, for the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring if Jane is not guilty is very low, reflecting the improbability that these specific findings are due to natural causes like SIDS.

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, respectively. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, we need to consider if there are other explanations for these autopsy findings. SIDS is mentioned as a possible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of identifiable cause after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

3. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion made when no cause of death is found after thorough investigation. The presence of specific injuries (like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) suggests that Ben's death may not be attributed to SIDS.

4. **Other accidental or natural causes**: For Jane to be not guilty, there must be an alternative explanation for Ben's condition. While the described injuries are not typical for SIDS, other accidental or natural causes could potentially lead to similar findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries described is more commonly associated with asphyxia or trauma.

5. **Likelihood assessment**: Given that the injuries are indicative of smothering or other violent trauma, and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying no smothering or intentional harm by her), we must consider how likely these findings are under the condition of her innocence. 

If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these specific injuries (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) would be unexpected because they are typically associated with non-accidental injury. However, it's not impossible that there could be other, less common explanations or that the death could be due to an unusual or undiagnosed medical condition.

Given the information and the fact that these findings are more typically associated with smothering or trauma rather than SIDS or other natural causes, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The injuries described are indicative of asphyxia or lack of oxygen, which can be caused by various factors including smothering, other forms of asphyxia, or natural conditions that lead to hypoxia.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, one of which is SIDS. However, SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infancy that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy. The presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, and bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, suggests that their deaths might not be typical SIDS cases, as SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings.

The key issue here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty of smothering or causing the trauma, there must be another explanation for the observed injuries. SIDS is not typically associated with the specific pathological findings observed in Ben and Andy. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the initial presentation of both infants could have been misinterpreted or that there could be other, less common natural causes or accidents that led to their deaths.

Given that the injuries are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma rather than SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, we have to consider the likelihood of these findings occurring due to other causes. Other causes could potentially include accidental asphyxia or other natural conditions leading to hypoxia, though these are not detailed in the given scenario.

The probability that the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred in the absence of smothering or violent trauma by Jane is relatively low, as these findings are more typically associated with asphyxial events. However, it's not zero because there could be other explanations, albeit less likely or less common ones.

Therefore, considering the given information and the specific details of the case, the likelihood of these findings occurring if Jane is not guilty is difficult to quantify directly without more context on alternative causes. However, it is generally low because the findings are suggestive of asphyxia/trauma.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries found in Andy are not a result of her actions. The injuries described, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are indicative of trauma and are often associated with non-accidental injury or abuse.

If these injuries were not caused by Jane or another perpetrator, there must be an alternative explanation. However, the presence of a torn frenulum, which is often associated with a significant force applied to the mouth, and other signs like bruises and blood in the lung, are not typical of accidental injuries or natural causes that one would expect in the context of SIDS.

While it's conceivable that some of these findings could be attributed to other causes or accidents, the combination of these specific injuries is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma.

The likelihood of these specific injuries occurring without any foul play or negligence is relatively low. There could be extremely rare or unusual medical conditions or accidents that might explain some of these findings, but they are not typical.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings is low because they are strongly indicative of non-accidental trauma.

Probability judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents need to be evaluated in the context of coincidence or other non-criminal factors.

The deaths of both babies at a similar age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) could be considered somewhat coincidental but not entirely unusual given that both were infants and SIDS is more common in the first few months of life.

The fact that they both died at a similar time of day after being fed could be related to various factors, including feeding patterns and infant care routines that might be similar for both babies.

The fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious is a circumstance that, while potentially suspicious, can occur coincidentally, especially if Jane was their primary caregiver.

However, the cumulative effect of these similarities (age, time of day, circumstance) is striking. If Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes, one might expect more variability in the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

The probability of these specific similarities occurring by chance, given that Jane is not guilty and assuming both deaths were due to unrelated natural causes or accidents, is relatively low. SIDS deaths, for instance, are unpredictable and do not typically occur under such similar circumstances.

Therefore, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance, if Jane is not guilty, is not extremely high.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not a result of her actions. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates a lack of oxygen, which can occur due to various reasons, including smothering, other forms of asphyxia, or natural conditions.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death provides a specific timeline for when the event causing the damage might have happened.

If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could have been caused by other factors or events unrelated to her actions. However, the timing of the damage (a matter of hours before death) is a factual matter that is independent of Jane's guilt or innocence.

The question then becomes whether it is plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death, regardless of who or what caused it.

The forensic evidence (hypoxic damage to the brain) suggests that there was a significant event or period of hypoxia relatively close to the time of death. The timing of this event is determined by medical evidence rather than Jane's guilt or innocence.

Therefore, if the medical evidence supports that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, Jane's guilt or innocence does not directly affect the likelihood of this fact.

To determine the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by Jane. The alternative explanation given is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's re-examined autopsy are typically considered indicative of non-accidental injury. However, the presence of these injuries does not necessarily prove that Jane was guilty of smothering or abuse, as there could be other explanations for these findings.

SIDS is generally defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infancy, and it doesn't typically present with the specific injuries mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung). The presence of such injuries usually prompts a more detailed investigation into the cause of death.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific injuries would be unexpected. However, it's also important to consider that some of these findings could potentially be coincidental or related to other factors (e.g., medical procedures, accidental injury, or other conditions).

The key issue here is that the specific injuries mentioned are not typical characteristics associated with SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the probability of finding these specific signs of trauma would be low.

However, quantifying this into a precise probability is challenging without more specific data on how often such injuries might be found in cases of SIDS or natural infant deaths.

Given the context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present due to other reasons (not smothering or abuse by Jane) would be considered low because the injuries are typically associated with non-accidental trauma.

Therefore, if we are to make an educated guess based on the information provided and the understanding that these injuries are not typical for SIDS, the likelihood of these findings in Andy if Jane is not guilty would be relatively low.

**Probability judgment: 10**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination.
The re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are being used as evidence against Jane, suggesting that Andy was smothered.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for Andy's death, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in the context of SIDS versus smothering.
The injuries found are indicative of abuse and are characteristic of smothering according to the prosecution. However, it's also possible that some of these findings could be misinterpreted or not directly related to smothering.

## Step 4: Evaluate the probability of these injuries occurring in a case of SIDS.
While SIDS is by definition an unexplained death, certain injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical characteristics used to define SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with such traumatic injuries.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood of the observed injuries if Jane is not guilty, implying Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would be unusual. However, it's crucial to understand that not all SIDS cases are thoroughly investigated for subtle signs of trauma, and some infants may have pre-existing conditions or accidental injuries.

## Step 6: Consider the possibility that some infants who die from SIDS might have incidental injuries or conditions that could be misinterpreted.
Some research suggests that infants who die from SIDS may occasionally have minor injuries or other findings that could be misconstrued as evidence of abuse.

## Step 7: Estimate the likelihood of the observed injuries in Andy if Jane is not guilty.
Given that the injuries are not typical for SIDS and are more suggestive of trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it is still possible but less likely that Andy had these injuries. The injuries could be incidental or misinterpreted.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood based on the available information.
The exact probability is difficult to determine without specific statistical data on the incidence of such injuries in SIDS cases. However, we can infer that if Jane is not guilty, the presence of these specific injuries is less likely because they are not characteristic of SIDS.

## Step 9: Provide a probability judgment.
Given the information and the understanding that the injuries are not typical for SIDS, we need to consider how likely it is for a SIDS case to present with such injuries. Research and forensic pathology suggest that while SIDS cases are unexplained, significant traumatic injuries are not characteristic. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of Andy having these injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would be low because they suggest a non-accidental injury.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, particularly in the context of the given scenario where SIDS is mentioned as a possible cause of death for both Andy and Ben.

1. **Understanding the findings**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is sometimes considered indicative of a blow to the mouth. However, it's also known that some of these injuries can occur accidentally or have other explanations.

2. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: SIDS is diagnosed when the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy. The presence of injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and internal injuries like blood in the lung would generally not be expected in a typical SIDS case, as SIDS implies a lack of identifiable cause for the death.

3. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or abuse her children. In this scenario, the injuries found in Andy (and potentially misattributed to smothering or abuse) would need an alternative explanation.

While some of the injuries (like bruises) could potentially be coincidental or due to accidental injury, others (like a torn frenulum and blood in the lung) are less likely to be explained by accident or SIDS alone, as they typically suggest some form of trauma.

However, it's essential to note that:
- Not all injuries are due to abuse; some can occur accidentally.
- The presence of certain injuries doesn't necessarily prove smothering but can be associated with other forms of trauma or even, in some cases, medical conditions or interventions.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries to be present, there would need to be an alternative explanation, such as accidental trauma (though the nature of the injuries might make this less likely) or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings.

The key question then becomes how likely it is for these specific injuries to occur in the context of SIDS or another non-criminal, non-abusive cause. Since SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and these injuries are not typical for SIDS, their presence complicates a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

To directly quantify the probability without more specific information about Andy's case (e.g., the exact nature of the bruises, how the frenulum was torn, the extent of the blood in the lung, and whether there were any other potential explanations or contributing factors) is challenging.

However, if we were to simplify the task to providing a judgment based on the information given and known facts about SIDS and infant injuries:

**Probability judgment: 5**

This reflects a low likelihood that these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would be present in Andy if Jane is not guilty, mainly because these findings are not characteristic of SIDS and suggest some form of trauma or injury. However, the exact probability could vary based on specifics not detailed in the scenario, such as the severity of the injuries and alternative explanations.

**Probability judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and implications of these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: 
   - Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of trauma or abuse.
   - A torn frenulum is often associated with a significant impact to the mouth or face.
   - Blood in the lung can be associated with a variety of causes, including infection, trauma, or other conditions.

2. **Assuming Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, then she did not smother or abuse her children.
   - The injuries found in both Andy and Ben would then need to be explained by other causes.

3. **Alternative Explanations**:
   - SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is given as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically present with the level of trauma described (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung).
   - The presence of such injuries typically suggests some form of trauma or accidental injury.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty of smothering or abusing her children, the presence of the described injuries in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would be unexpected and not directly related to SIDS.
   - These findings are more indicative of some form of trauma.

5. **Assessing Probability**:
   - The probability of these specific injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or accidental death (without any foul play) is low because SIDS does not typically involve such trauma.
   - However, it's also possible that some accidental or unforeseen circumstance could result in similar injuries, though this is not typical for SIDS.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the children died of SIDS or another natural/accidental cause, the likelihood of the described injuries is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS.

Given the information and the context provided, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty is considered low due to the nature of these injuries not being typical for SIDS or natural causes.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem provides the background of a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben. The initial autopsy for Andy suggested natural causes of death, but after Ben's autopsy showed injuries indicative of abuse, a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Analyze the findings in Andy's re-examination
The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are presented as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. However, we need to consider these findings in the context of Jane's guilt or innocence.

## Step 3: Consider the alternative explanation - SIDS
The problem mentions SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) as an alternative explanation for the deaths of Andy and Ben. SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of infants during their first year of life, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the findings if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or other natural causes. We need to assess how likely the observed injuries in Andy are under the assumption that Jane is innocent.

## Step 5: Assess the probability of the observed injuries in Andy if Jane is innocent
The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are typically associated with non-accidental injury. If Jane is innocent, these findings would be unexpected because they suggest abuse. However, it's crucial to consider that some of these findings could potentially be misinterpreted or have alternative explanations.

## Step 6: Consider the context of SIDS and the likelihood of similar findings
While SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death, some infants who die of SIDS may have minor injuries or other findings at autopsy. However, the specific findings in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS.

## Step 7: Determine the probability
Given that the injuries are indicative of non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were due to natural causes or accidents), the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring would be low because they are not typical of SIDS or accidental deaths.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood
The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is strongly suggestive of non-accidental trauma. In the context of SIDS or accidental death, such findings are unusual and not characteristic. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these findings would be low.

## Step 9: Final probability judgment
Given the information and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be very low because these are indicative of non-accidental injury. Thus, we are looking for a low probability.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes of death, but upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy showed signs of injury, Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Analyze the significance of the findings in Andy's re-examination
The findings in Andy's re-examination (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of abuse. A torn frenulum is often associated with physical abuse, as it can be caused by a blow to the mouth or forcing something into the mouth. Bruises and blood in the lung can also be signs of trauma.

## Step 3: Consider the alternative explanation - SIDS
SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is given as an alternative explanation for the deaths of Andy and Ben. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the observed injuries in SIDS
SIDS, by definition, is unexplained and not typically associated with the specific injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung). These injuries are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

## Step 5: Assess the probability of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm by her. The presence of the injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) in Andy would then need to be explained by other factors. However, these injuries are not typical of SIDS. The occurrence of such injuries in a case presumed to be SIDS would be unusual.

## Step 6: Consider the probability of observing such injuries in the context of SIDS
Given that SIDS is an unexplained death and not directly associated with the specific traumatic injuries found, the likelihood of these injuries being present in a true SIDS case is low. However, it's also important to consider that some cases initially thought to be SIDS might later be found to have other explanations upon further investigation.

## Step 7: Determine the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific injuries would be unexpected. The injuries suggest a non-natural cause, contradicting the assumption of innocence regarding smothering or abuse.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood
The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not characteristic of SIDS. The probability of observing these injuries in a case of SIDS (or if Jane is not guilty of smothering) is low because they are indicative of trauma.

## Step 9: Final assessment
Given the information and the context that these injuries are not typical for SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), the likelihood of these injuries being present due to other non-SIDS, non-abuse related causes is still low because they are indicative of trauma.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the initial diagnosis of Andy's death as being due to natural causes and the later findings that suggested potential abuse. If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes or be indicative of a different underlying condition or circumstance.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can occur due to various reasons, including accidental injury, birth trauma, or bleeding disorders. However, in the context of a baby who was thought to have died of natural causes initially, the presence of bruises might suggest that there was either an initial misinterpretation of the cause of these bruises or they were not recognized as significant at the time.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if it is considered in isolation. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common. The significance of a torn frenulum can depend on the explanation provided for it.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding could be consistent with a number of different scenarios, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or other medical conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, several alternative explanations could be considered for the findings in Andy and Ben. One such explanation is that both deaths were SIDS, but this doesn't directly explain the injuries found. Another possibility is that there was a misinterpretation of the autopsy findings or that there was an underlying medical condition that contributed to these findings.

However, given that the injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of possible non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it implies these findings should be explained by other means.

SIDS is not typically associated with such injuries, and while it is possible for a child to have underlying conditions or coincidental findings that could be misinterpreted, the presence of these specific injuries in both children raises suspicions.

To provide a probability judgment, we need to weigh the likelihood of these findings occurring in a context where Jane is not guilty (and thus the deaths and injuries might be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other medical conditions) against the evidence suggesting non-accidental injury.

The probability that these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are found in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because these are not typical findings associated with SIDS or most natural causes of death in infants. They are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

However, without more specific information on alternative explanations for these findings and their likelihood, we have to consider that the presence of these injuries is unusual for SIDS or natural deaths.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, we are considering alternative explanations for Ben's death and the hypoxic damage to his brain. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. 

The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline for when the damage occurred. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could have been caused by various factors not directly related to her actions, such as an underlying medical condition or an accident. However, the timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is what's critical.

For SIDS or a natural cause, it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage would be observable and attributed to a specific timeframe before death unless there was an identifiable cause or condition leading to that damage. 

However, the presence of hypoxic damage indicates that there was a period of oxygen deprivation. If this occurred a matter of hours before death, it suggests that there was a significant event or condition that led to this damage.

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the plausibility of other causes or explanations for this damage that are not related to Jane's actions. 

The medical evidence and autopsy findings would be crucial in determining the likelihood of this scenario. If the hypoxic damage is confirmed and dated to a matter of hours before death, the question becomes whether this could plausibly occur without Jane being guilty (e.g., due to an underlying condition, accidental cause, etc.).

Given that the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death suggests a significant and potentially identifiable cause, and if we assume that Jane is not guilty and thus not responsible for causing this damage, the likelihood of this scenario occurring without her guilt still depends on the medical plausibility and alternative explanations.

Since the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is a factual finding that doesn't directly imply guilt or innocence but rather indicates a medical condition or event, the question is whether this could happen without Jane being guilty.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is dependent on the existence of plausible alternative causes or explanations. If such explanations exist and are medically plausible, then the probability could be considered relatively higher.

Probability judgment: 50
If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents could be attributed to coincidence or other factors not related to her actions. Let's examine the similarities mentioned:

1. **Both babies were about the same age when they died**: Both Andy and Ben were around 8-11 weeks old when they died. This similarity could be considered coincidental, given that both were infants and the age range for SIDS or other natural causes can cluster around this period.

2. **They both died at a similar time of day after just being fed**: This could be related to the routine care of infants, where feeding often occurs around similar times of the day. The timing of death in relation to feeding could be coincidental, especially if both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause that is not directly related to the timing of feeding.

3. **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them**: This similarity is more circumstantial and relates to the fact that Jane was the primary caregiver. Being alone with the babies when they were found unconscious could be due to the natural caregiving responsibilities and the fact that these events occurred in the home.

If Jane is not guilty, and both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance is not extremely low because some of these factors (age, timing relative to feeding) could be related to the natural patterns of infant care and the age-specific risks for SIDS.

However, the combination of these specific similarities is still quite striking. The probability of all these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty is difficult to quantify without more context on how common these circumstances are in infant deaths.

While each of these factors alone might not be highly unlikely, their combination is noteworthy. However, if we consider that both deaths could be SIDS and that Jane was the primary caregiver, some of these similarities become less surprising.

Probability judgment: 30
If Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids need to be explained by other causes.

1. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain**: This indicates a lack of oxygen, which can be caused by various factors, including SIDS, accidental asphyxia, or other medical conditions.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These can be associated with trauma, including non-accidental injury, but can also occur due to other medical conditions or natural causes, though this is less common.

If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings depends on alternative explanations. SIDS is often considered when there's no clear evidence of trauma or other causes, but SIDS typically does not result in significant pathological findings like hypoxic brain damage or hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.

The presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is not typical for SIDS, which is generally characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings.

Alternative medical explanations or rare conditions could potentially explain these findings, but they are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of infant death.

Given that these findings are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury or smothering, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings is relatively low because they are not characteristic of the more benign or natural causes of death like SIDS.

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's case, it indicates that his brain suffered from insufficient oxygen, which could be due to various reasons including smothering, as alleged, or other medical conditions.

2. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The scenario suggests that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the deaths could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is known for its unpredictability and lack of clear cause or mechanism. However, the presence of specific injuries (like hypoxic damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, bruises, torn frenulum, and hemorrhages) in both babies, especially Ben, makes SIDS less likely as SIDS typically does not present with such findings.

3. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, and we consider SIDS or another natural/accidental cause, the timing and nature of the hypoxic damage need to be assessed. SIDS is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage preceding death as its pathophysiology is not well understood and is characterized by the absence of a clear cause of death after thorough investigation.

4. **Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline for the cause of the damage. If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing could be seen as inconsistent with SIDS, as SIDS does not typically involve a clearly identifiable agonal period (the period of time just before death) with hypoxic damage.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: The key issue here is whether the hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is consistent with Jane being not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, implying that the death could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage, along with other injuries, complicates this interpretation. The specific timing (a matter of hours before death) might not directly relate to SIDS or an accidental cause, as these typically do not have a prolonged agonal phase with significant hypoxic damage.

6. **Conclusion**: The presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is less likely to be associated with SIDS or a natural cause, as SIDS deaths are generally unexpected and lack a clear cause or significant pre-mortem distress indicators like hypoxic brain damage.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, as alleged, is low because it implies a process that is not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Context of the Case**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to another cause, such as SIDS.

2. **Understanding SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, given when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation. The cause of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by insufficient oxygen. In the context of SIDS or other natural causes, hypoxic damage could potentially occur due to various reasons not related to smothering, such as respiratory distress or failure.

3. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death is a critical piece of evidence against Jane, as it suggests a recent event leading to the damage. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a point of interest.

4. **Analyzing the Scenario if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to SIDS or a similar condition, the presence of hypoxic damage might be attributed to the natural course of the condition leading to death, rather than to an act of smothering by Jane. However, the specific timing of this damage (a matter of hours before death) is crucial. 

In cases of SIDS, the process leading to death can be rapid, and some research suggests that the terminal episode might be preceded by a period of distress or illness, potentially leading to hypoxic damage. However, the exact timing and nature of such events are highly variable and not well-defined.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider alternative explanations like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to natural causes is not directly supported or refuted by the given information about SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, and while some infants may have had prior illness or stress, the timing of any hypoxic damage in such cases is not typically pinpointed to "a matter of hours before death" as a defining characteristic.

Given the lack of specific information linking the timing of hypoxic damage directly to SIDS or other natural causes in this context, and considering that the prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation of the autopsy findings as indicative of smothering, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death by natural causes is uncertain. However, the presence of significant autopsy findings (like hypoxic damage) might suggest that the death was not entirely without warning or explanation, potentially moving away from a typical SIDS profile.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted injury by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries found in Ben, is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when no other cause of death is found after thorough investigation.

However, the question is about the timing of the hypoxic damage if Jane is not guilty. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain. In cases of SIDS, there isn't a clear indication of when hypoxic damage might occur, as SIDS is, by definition, unexplained.

The injuries found on Ben (and retrospectively on Andy) are more indicative of a non-SIDS cause, potentially suggesting a non-natural or violent cause of death if we were to consider the prosecution's case. However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and thus consider SIDS or another natural cause, we must question the interpretation of the hypoxic damage.

The hypoxic damage being caused "a matter of hours before death" is a specific claim. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the expectation might be that any hypoxic damage would be related to the terminal event (the death itself), rather than being a separate event occurring hours before.

However, SIDS is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage indicative of a prolonged agonal phase before death; the death is generally unexpected and without a clear cause.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and we are considering an alternative explanation like SIDS, the specific timing of hypoxic damage "a matter of hours before death" may not directly correlate with the typical understanding of SIDS, as SIDS deaths are sudden.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty (thus leaning towards a natural or unexplained cause like SIDS), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death may be considered in the context of whether such damage aligns with a natural or unexplained death. The presence of specific injuries complicates a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

The probability judgment should reflect how likely it is for hypoxic damage to occur hours before death in a scenario where Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the expectation around the timing and nature of hypoxic damage may not be directly applicable as it would in cases of known cause.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the case and the condition of Ben's brain at autopsy.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the autopsy of Ben showing hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries.

## Step 2: Consider the implications of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain.
Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor alleged that this damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death, suggesting that the cause of death was related to an event or condition that led to oxygen deprivation.

## Step 3: Evaluate the assumption that Jane is NOT GUILTY.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). An alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

## Step 4: Analyze the given alternative explanation - SIDS.
SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion given when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK. While SIDS is more common among boys, the presence of specific injuries (like those found in Ben and retrospectively in Andy) complicates the attribution of their deaths to SIDS.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming SIDS or another natural cause is responsible, the hypoxic damage could potentially be a result of a natural condition or an agonal process (i.e., related to the process of dying). However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) and nature (hypoxic damage) might not be directly related to SIDS, as SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause.

## Step 6: Consider the medical evidence and its interpretation.
The medical evidence (hypoxic damage, injuries to ribs and spinal cord, etc.) suggests a possible unnatural cause of death. If Jane is not guilty, one must consider alternative explanations for these findings. However, the presence of such injuries makes SIDS less likely as an explanation.

## Step 7: Evaluate the probability based on the given condition (Jane is NOT GUILTY).
Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions, the hypoxic damage's timing and cause need to be considered in this context. The prosecution's case relies on the timing and nature of the injuries. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to natural causes or an accident not related to smothering is low because the injuries described are not typical for SIDS.

## Step 8: Determine the likelihood.
The condition described (hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death) is suggestive of an acute event. If Jane is innocent, it's still possible that such an event occurred, but the described injuries and the implication of smothering complicate the attribution to a natural or accidental cause.

## Step 9: Provide a probability judgment based on the analysis.
Given the injuries and the context, if Jane is not guilty, the scenario that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death by a non-criminal act or natural cause is less likely due to the presence of other injuries. However, it's not entirely impossible as there could be other explanations for the observed damage.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To address the question, let's analyze the information given and the scenario where Jane is not guilty.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively).

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries that included hypoxic damage to the brain, which indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. The prosecution's expert testified that this hypoxic damage must have occurred a matter of hours before death.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense or an alternative explanation could suggest that the deaths were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, typically during their first year, without a clear cause.

4. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage Timing if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions. SIDS is one such possibility.

5. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as contradicting the typical profile of SIDS since it implies a period of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) before death. However, the timing and cause of this hypoxia are critical.

6. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we consider SIDS or a similar natural cause as a plausible explanation, we need to assess how likely it is that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death. 

   a. **Understanding SIDS and Hypoxia**: SIDS deaths are often associated with some level of hypoxia or asphyxia, but the exact mechanism is not well understood. The presence of hypoxic damage does not necessarily rule out SIDS entirely but makes it less typical.

   b. **Assessing the Prosecution's Claim**: The claim that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise. If Jane is not guilty, this timing would need to be reconciled with a natural or accidental cause.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death becomes a matter of interpreting the medical evidence in the context of SIDS.

Given the sudden and unexplained nature of SIDS, and if we are to assume Jane's innocence, it's less likely that the hypoxic damage (implying a prolonged process) aligns with the typical SIDS profile, which is sudden. However, the exact timing and cause of hypoxic damage can vary, and some SIDS cases may involve agonal (near-death) processes that could potentially result in hypoxic changes.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty would depend on how one weighs the medical evidence against the backdrop of SIDS or other natural causes.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS, as suggested. 

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates that there was a period of oxygen deprivation before death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death was not due to her actions (like smothering), and thus, the hypoxic damage could be a result of another cause or a natural process leading to death.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and understanding of how such damage occurs. Hypoxic damage typically occurs due to a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which can happen for various reasons, not necessarily due to smothering.

If we are to consider that Jane is not guilty and that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death might seem contradictory because SIDS is, by definition, unexplained and not typically associated with clear evidence of a prolonged period of hypoxia before death that is recognizable upon autopsy.

However, some research suggests that some infants who die of SIDS may have experienced hypoxia or other stressors before death, although the exact timing and nature can be difficult to determine.

Given that the deaths are being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and exploring the possibility that the cause was SIDS or a similar unexplained condition, the assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death might be less likely if we are strictly interpreting SIDS as having no explainable cause or evidence of a struggle or intentional act leading to hypoxia.

However, the actual timing of when hypoxic damage occurred can be complex and depend on various factors, including the nature of the event causing hypoxia.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider alternative explanations like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a natural or accidental event (not due to smothering or similar) might be considered low because SIDS does not typically involve clear evidence of a significant hypoxic event hours before death that would be identifiable on autopsy.

Therefore, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is uncertain and depends heavily on the interpretation of the cause of death and the nature of the hypoxic damage.

**80**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both Andy and Ben would be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause. However, the presence of hypoxic damage, along with other injuries such as to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages, is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. SIDS diagnoses are typically made when no other cause of death is found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timing for the cause of this damage. If Ben's death was due to SIDS and not smothering or another form of maltreatment, the hypoxic damage would need to be explained within the context of SIDS or another natural cause.

However, the described autopsy findings for Ben (and the revisited findings for Andy) strongly suggest a non-natural cause of death, contradicting a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxiation (like hypoxic damage, rib injuries, and hemorrhages).

If Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar condition, we would expect the autopsy findings to be more consistent with SIDS, which typically means an absence of specific findings that indicate trauma or asphyxia.

Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death due to a natural cause like SIDS is low because the autopsy findings suggest otherwise.

Therefore, considering Jane is not guilty implies an alternative explanation for the deaths that doesn't align with the presence of significant pathological findings.

**Probability judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries found during the autopsy of Ben, is not typically associated with SIDS, as SIDS is diagnosed when no cause of death can be determined after thorough investigation and autopsy.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause not related to smothering or any form of intentional harm by Jane. However, the autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, suggest that his death may not be typical of SIDS.

The specific timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred in relation to Ben's death is crucial. Hypoxic damage indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, it is not clear why there would be evidence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death unless the condition leading to death somehow caused or was associated with earlier hypoxia.

However, the prosecution's case implies that the hypoxic damage was caused by an external action (smothering), which would be consistent with the damage occurring shortly before death. If Jane is not guilty and the death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the expectation might be that the hypoxic damage, if related to the cause of death, would be more closely associated with the time of death.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty hinges on whether SIDS or a similar condition could cause such damage. SIDS is not typically characterized by such specific pathological findings indicative of a hypoxic event occurring hours before death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring a matter of hours before death would be unexpected under a scenario where SIDS is the cause of death, as SIDS does not typically present with clear evidence of hypoxia or trauma.

However, without a clear alternative explanation that links SIDS directly to hypoxic damage hours before death, and considering the autopsy findings are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial cause, the scenario that Jane is not guilty (implying SIDS or a similar natural cause) becomes less likely given the presence of such findings.

The probability judgment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is related to how plausible it is that SIDS or another natural cause could result in such damage. Given that SIDS is not typically associated with clear signs of hypoxic damage or trauma, and the presence of such findings is more suggestive of an external cause, the likelihood is low.

**20**
To solve this, let's analyze the information provided in the context of the question.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of both children is initially investigated, with the first death attributed to natural causes and the second raising suspicions due to autopsy findings.

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including hypoxic damage to the brain, which indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. The prosecution alleges this was due to smothering.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense could argue that both deaths were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, often with no clear cause.

4. **The Specific Question**: The question revolves around the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

- **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic brain damage refers to injury caused by insufficient oxygen to the brain. In the context of infant deaths, this could be due to various reasons, not just smothering.

- **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS deaths often show signs of hypoxic damage because the death is typically associated with a failure of the infant to adequately oxygenate. However, the timing and mechanism can vary.

- **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on the assumption that it was due to an acute event like smothering. However, if the death was due to SIDS, the interpretation of the timing of hypoxic damage might differ.

Given that Jane is not guilty (implying SIDS or another natural cause), the assumption that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death because of smothering is less likely to be valid. SIDS can involve a complex pathophysiology that might not be fully understood, and the presence of hypoxic damage does not necessarily indicate a violent act like smothering occurred just before death.

However, the actual timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS cases is not clearly defined and can vary. SIDS is associated with various pathological findings, including hypoxic damage, but these are typically seen as part of the syndrome rather than indicative of a specific timing or cause like smothering.

**Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS, the doctor's assertion about the timing might not be directly relevant or could be considered less likely because it presumes a mechanism (smothering) that is not supported under the assumption of innocence.

Given the lack of clear information on the exact timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS and considering that SIDS is a diagnosis often made after excluding other causes, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death under the assumption of Jane's innocence (and thus potentially SIDS) is difficult to quantify directly.

However, since the doctor's statement is based on an assumption of smothering, which is not valid under the condition that Jane is not guilty, one might infer that the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death (in the context of SIDS or another natural cause) is not necessarily supported.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis given when an infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and no cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation and autopsy. It's known that SIDS is associated with various risk factors, but it doesn't have a clear mechanism or cause.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or any infant death, hypoxic damage could potentially occur due to various reasons, including but not limited to, smothering or an underlying condition leading to respiratory distress.

3. **Ben's Autopsy Findings**: Ben's autopsy showed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. The presence of hypoxic damage indicates that there was some period of oxygen deprivation.

4. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by her. In such a case, the hypoxic damage could potentially be related to the cause of death or a condition leading to death that is not necessarily related to an act by Jane.

5. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage Timing**: SIDS is by definition an unexplained death. However, the presence of significant hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben's autopsy is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically doesn't present with such clear signs of hypoxia or trauma.

6. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or a similar unexplained condition as a potential cause of death, the hypoxic damage observed could potentially be related to the terminal event or an agonal process (the process associated with the moment of death). However, attributing the timing of hypoxic damage specifically to "a matter of hours before death" based on SIDS or a similar condition is challenging without more context on how SIDS might present with such damage.

7. **The Likelihood**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death may still be plausible because it could be related to the terminal events or agonal processes associated with the death.

However, SIDS typically doesn't have a prolonged agonal period with significant hypoxic damage as described. The described autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not characteristic of typical SIDS and suggest a more complex scenario.

**Given the scenario and assuming Jane is not guilty, the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS, and attributing the hypoxic damage to a natural cause or SIDS with the given specifics (especially the timing and nature of the injuries) is challenging. However, the question is about the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death under the assumption of Jane's innocence.**

**Likelihood Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for the death of Ben, such as SIDS.

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. It's known for occurring suddenly and unexpectedly in infants, typically under one year of age.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or any infant death, the presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways depending on the circumstances. However, SIDS by definition is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage that can be directly linked to a specific timeframe before death, as its cause is unexplained.

3. **Interpreting Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeframe for when the damage occurred. If Jane is not guilty, this implies the death might be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

4. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty and the death is due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death becomes less directly related to her actions. However, SIDS cases do not typically present with clear evidence of hypoxic damage that can be timed to a specific period before death. 

5. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The autopsy findings (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is a diagnosis made after excluding other causes. These findings suggest there might be an underlying cause that could have led to the hypoxic damage.

6. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider if there could be another explanation for the hypoxic damage. However, the detailed autopsy findings for Ben (and the re-examination findings for Andy) are not characteristic of SIDS, making it less likely as a standalone explanation.

7. **Probability Judgment**: The critical question is whether, in the absence of Jane's guilt (implying a natural or accidental cause), it's plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. 

If the death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of significant autopsy findings (like hypoxic damage, injuries to ribs and spinal cord) is unusual. The specific timing of hypoxic damage in such cases is not directly aligned with the typical profile of SIDS. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative natural cause or SIDS (despite the atypical autopsy findings), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death being directly related to her actions or lack thereof (in terms of not being a result of smothering) becomes a complex assessment.

The information given (significant autopsy findings not typical for SIDS) makes it challenging to directly tie the likelihood of the timing of hypoxic damage to Jane's innocence without more context on alternative causes.

However, if one were to assess the probability based on the information given and the context of Jane's innocence implying a non-homicide cause, we are still left with the fact that the autopsy results are not typical for SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Context**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm caused by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

2. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death in infancy. It is known to occur without warning, and there's no clear cause or mechanism identified. However, it is associated with certain risk factors.

3. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS, we must understand that SIDS itself is not directly attributed to a specific cause like hypoxia due to smothering. Instead, various theories suggest possible underlying mechanisms, but these are still speculative.

4. **Interpreting the Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical interpretation. If Ben died of SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways. SIDS deaths are typically characterized by a lack of clear evidence of cause, but post-mortem findings can sometimes suggest that there was a period of distress or struggle before death.

However, SIDS by definition occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, and infants who die from SIDS are often found to have died after being put down to sleep without any preceding signs of distress that would be considered unusual by their caregivers.

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS, the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death might not directly align with the typical profile of SIDS, as SIDS deaths are generally unexpected and not typically associated with a clear period of hypoxia that would be diagnosable hours before death. However, the presence of hypoxic damage could be seen in cases where there was some form of distress.

Given that the exact mechanisms behind SIDS are not fully understood and that SIDS is diagnosed after excluding other causes of death, the interpretation of hypoxic damage in this context becomes complex. Research into SIDS has suggested various pathological findings, but these are not universally present or accepted as definitive markers.

Therefore, without more specific information linking the timing of hypoxic damage directly to the circumstances of Ben's death under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus, potentially died of SIDS or another natural cause), we must approach this cautiously.

The probability judgment about the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is highly dependent on understanding the underlying cause of death and the pathological processes involved.

**50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben showed hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries, suggesting a lack of oxygen. The question pertains to the timing of this hypoxic damage in relation to Ben's death.

2. **Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The prosecution's expert testified that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of death and the timing of the hypoxic damage need to be considered in the context of an alternative explanation, such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or explanation for the death, and it does not typically involve significant findings like hypoxic damage to the brain or other injuries seen in Ben.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death might be attributed to SIDS or another cause. However, the presence of significant injuries (like hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages) in Ben makes SIDS an unlikely explanation because SIDS typically does not present with such clear evidence of trauma or asphyxia.

5. **Considering the Hypoxic Damage**: The hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen. If Jane is not guilty and the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it's less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" as a result of a natural disease process that is typically associated with SIDS.

However, some natural conditions could potentially cause hypoxic damage. The key issue is whether such conditions would be consistent with the other evidence and the timeline suggested by the prosecution's expert.

6. **Probability Judgment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, and considering that SIDS or other natural causes are less likely to result in the specific pattern of injuries seen in Ben, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" due to natural causes is relatively low. This is because the injuries suggest a possible asphyxial event, which is not characteristic of SIDS.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is difficult to quantify directly from the given information but given the injuries, it leans towards being less likely under the not guilty scenario for natural causes like SIDS.

**20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and available information.

1. **Understanding the Allegation and the Condition**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of sufficient oxygen.

2. **Considering the Alternative Explanation (SIDS)**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause.

3. **Analyzing SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. Hypoxic damage is not typically described as a characteristic feature of SIDS; instead, SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out.

4. **Interpreting the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS**: If Ben's death is attributed to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain might suggest that there was a period of oxygen deprivation before death. However, the timing and cause of this deprivation are crucial for understanding whether it aligns with a natural cause like SIDS or a more acute event.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and both deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death might not be directly related to an act of smothering or intentional harm. However, SIDS does not typically involve documented hypoxic damage as a characteristic feature. The occurrence of such damage might suggest a pathological process or event that led to the infant's death.

6. **Determining the Probability**: Given the information provided and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar cause), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding smothering. However, the prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation of the autopsy findings as indicative of smothering.

The presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as consistent with a variety of scenarios, including an acute event leading to death. If we are to consider SIDS or a natural cause, attributing the hypoxic damage to a specific timeframe (hours before death) without clear evidence linking it to an external act (like smothering) requires understanding that SIDS itself doesn't typically present with clear signs of hypoxia before death.

Therefore, the probability judgment regarding the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty, depends on how one interprets the hypoxic damage in the context of SIDS or a similar condition.

Given the information and focusing on the condition (hypoxic damage) rather than Jane's guilt or innocence directly, if the deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the expectation is that there wouldn't be clear evidence of hypoxic damage caused a matter of hours before death as a characteristic feature.

However, without specific data on how often SIDS cases might involve such findings or how they are interpreted, we're left to reason based on the given scenario.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
If Jane is not guilty, then the death of Ben could be attributed to SIDS. In the context of SIDS, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could be a result of the underlying cause of death, rather than a result of smothering. SIDS is characterized by a lack of clear cause or explanation for the infant's death, and various factors can contribute to it, including underlying vulnerabilities in the infant.

The presence of hypoxic damage indicates that there was a period of oxygen deprivation before death. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the hypoxic damage could have occurred as part of the terminal events leading to his death, rather than as a result of intentional smothering by Jane.

The timing of the hypoxic damage, as alleged by the doctor to be a matter of hours before death, could be consistent with the possibility that Ben's death was related to an underlying condition or vulnerability that contributed to SIDS. However, the exact timing and cause of hypoxic damage in SIDS cases can be difficult to ascertain.

Given that SIDS is more about an unexplained death rather than a clearly defined cause, and assuming Jane is not guilty (meaning the deaths are not due to her actions like smothering), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death could be considered plausible as part of the terminal events or the underlying processes related to SIDS.

Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty, could be considered relatively high because it aligns with the possibility that the damage was part of the process leading to his death due to SIDS.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the alternative explanations for the deaths of Andy and Ben, specifically the possibility that they died from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, given when the death of an infant under one year of age remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy. The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors.

2. **Hypoxic Damage in SIDS**: The hypoxic damage found in Ben's brain could be consistent with a variety of scenarios, not just smothering. In the context of SIDS, it is plausible that episodes of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) could occur.

3. **Timeline of Hypoxic Damage**: The assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion that requires careful consideration. If Jane is not guilty, and both deaths were due to SIDS, the timing of the hypoxic damage is less directly linked to an act of smothering by Jane.

4. **SIDS and Hypoxia**: SIDS deaths often show signs that could be interpreted as evidence of pre-mortem hypoxia or stress, such as intrathoracic petechiae (tiny hemorrhages). The presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as part of the spectrum of findings in SIDS, although the exact mechanisms leading to SIDS are not well understood.

5. **Relevance to Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a matter of the natural disease process rather than an act of smothering. The presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death could be coincidental with the process leading to SIDS, rather than evidence of a deliberate act.

6. **Likelihood Assessment**: Given that SIDS is an unexplained phenomenon and can have various pathological findings, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is plausible as part of the dying process or a pre-terminal event.

Therefore, in the context of Jane's innocence and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar condition, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is quite plausible.

**Probability Judgment: 70**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider two main scenarios under the assumption that Jane is not guilty: 

1. The death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause.
2. There was another cause or accident leading to the death that does not involve Jane's guilt.

First, let's consider the scenario where Ben's death is attributed to SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature, and it is diagnosed after ruling out other causes of death. Hypoxic damage to the brain can be associated with various conditions, including those that might lead to or be related to SIDS. However, if Ben's death was due to SIDS, the presence of significant hypoxic damage (implying a lack of oxygen) and other injuries (like rib injuries and hemorrhages in the eyes) makes this less likely as SIDS is typically not associated with such specific pathological findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.

The prosecution's case against Jane hinges on the interpretation that the injuries, including the hypoxic damage, were caused by smothering. If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation is needed for the observed injuries and the hypoxic damage.

The expert testimony that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is significant. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was not due to SIDS or an accident that could cause such damage, we need to consider alternative explanations that are not related to Jane's actions.

The key question revolves around the timing and cause of the hypoxic damage. If the damage was indeed caused a matter of hours before death, and if Jane is not guilty, then either the damage was caused by some other means unrelated to Jane's actions or the interpretation of the timing of the hypoxic damage is incorrect.

However, the details given do not directly support an alternative cause or accident that would result in such specific and severe injuries and damage if Jane is not guilty. 

Given the context and assuming Jane is not guilty, if we were to believe that the cause of the hypoxic damage was not related to Jane's actions, we would need an alternative explanation for the observed pathology, which is challenging based on the information provided.

To give a probability judgment on how likely it is that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we are essentially assessing the likelihood of an alternative explanation that fits the observed facts.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

The low probability reflects the challenge in explaining the observed hypoxic damage and other injuries under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and without attributing it to an action that would imply guilt (like smothering). The presence of such specific and severe pathological findings makes it difficult to entirely rule out foul play or to accept an alternative innocent explanation that fits all the observed facts. 

**20**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries found in Ben, is not typically a characteristic used to define SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion made when other causes are ruled out.

However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and both deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause, we must consider whether the findings in Ben (and the subsequent re-evaluation of Andy's autopsy) could be consistent with SIDS or if they necessarily imply a traumatic or violent cause.

The injuries found in Ben (and upon re-examination in Andy) such as hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages, and other signs could be indicative of a non-natural cause of death, potentially contradicting a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. However, some research has suggested that certain findings, like intrathoracic petechiae (tiny hemorrhages), can be present in SIDS cases.

The critical issue is the timing and interpretation of the hypoxic brain damage in the context of SIDS or another natural cause. Hypoxic damage typically indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen to the brain, which can occur due to various reasons, including smothering or other asphyxial mechanisms. If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to SIDS or a similar natural phenomenon, the presence of hypoxic damage might be harder to reconcile with SIDS unless it's part of the syndrome's spectrum or due to agonal (related to the moment of death) or post-mortem changes.

The assertion that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death implies a traumatic or asphyxial event occurring within that timeframe. If Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a natural part of the dying process is less clear.

However, since SIDS is by definition unexplained and the presence of significant hypoxic damage is not a typical characteristic used to support a SIDS diagnosis, attributing this specific finding to SIDS or a similar natural cause of death is challenging.

Therefore, considering Jane is not guilty and assuming the death could be due to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death as part of a natural dying process is uncertain and not directly supported by the typical understanding of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the case and the allegations against Jane.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, with the allegation that she smothered them. The death of the second son, Ben, was investigated further after the autopsy revealed injuries suggesting possible foul play.

## Step 2: Review the autopsy findings for Ben and their implications.
The autopsy on Ben found injuries including hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord. The hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen to the brain.

## Step 3: Consider the doctor's allegation regarding the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain.
The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death. This implies that if Jane is guilty, the smothering (if it happened) occurred shortly before Ben's death was discovered.

## Step 4: Evaluate the alternative explanation for the deaths: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, with no clear cause. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural causes or SIDS. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben's autopsy suggests that his death may not have been a typical SIDS case. SIDS does not typically present with such specific pathological findings indicative of hypoxia or injury.

## Step 6: Consider the pathology findings in the context of SIDS or natural causes.
The specific findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain, are not characteristic of SIDS, which is typically diagnosed after excluding other causes of death. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage would need an alternative explanation that is not related to smothering.

## Step 7: Analyze the probability of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes less directly related to Jane's actions. However, the pathology findings suggest a possible acute event. For SIDS or other natural causes, such specific and severe findings are unusual.

## Step 8: Consider alternative natural causes or explanations for the hypoxic damage.
Some natural conditions could potentially cause hypoxic damage, but the combination of findings in Ben's autopsy is suggestive of an acute, severe event rather than a typical SIDS case.

## Step 9: Assess the likelihood based on the information given.
Given that Jane is not guilty, and if we are to consider alternative explanations for Ben's death, the doctor's allegation about the timing of the hypoxic damage may still hold if there's an alternative cause for the damage that occurred shortly before death. However, the specific cause and the fact that it happened a matter of hours before death may not be directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence but rather to the underlying cause of death.

## Step 10: Determine the probability judgment.
The question is about the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty. The autopsy findings suggest an acute event, which could be consistent with the doctor's allegation regardless of Jane's guilt. However, if Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an alternative explanation. The presence of hypoxic damage does indicate an event occurred, but attributing it to a natural cause or accident is challenging given the other injuries found.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The provided information states that SIDS is more common among boys than girls and occurs in 1 in 4,000 cases in the UK. However, it does not directly inform us about the timing of hypoxic damage in relation to death in SIDS cases.

The key issue here is understanding whether SIDS could involve hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death. Research and medical understanding suggest that SIDS deaths are often associated with a combination of environmental and intrinsic factors that may lead to asphyxia or other pathophysiological changes. However, SIDS is typically not diagnosed with significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage hours before death; rather, it is a diagnosis of exclusion after thorough investigation.

The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries found in Ben (and retrospectively in Andy), suggests that their deaths may not be typical SIDS cases as described in the scenario, which emphasizes the unexplained nature of SIDS without significant pathological findings indicative of a prolonged agonal period.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or another natural or accidental cause for the deaths, the specific timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) as alleged is not directly aligned with the classic definition of SIDS. SIDS is generally understood to occur suddenly and without warning signs that would be evident upon autopsy.

However, it's also understood that some cases initially thought to be SIDS might upon further examination reveal other causes or contributing factors. The fact that both children had findings that were not typical for SIDS (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung for Andy, and specific injuries for Ben) complicates the SIDS diagnosis.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage to have occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death under a scenario not involving Jane's guilt (potentially SIDS or other natural causes), one would have to consider alternative explanations that could lead to such damage. However, the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty depends on alternative causes that could explain both the damage and the death. Without a clear alternative cause that fits the described scenario and is consistent with innocence, we're left to evaluate the likelihood based on the information given.

Since the presence of hypoxic damage hours before death is not characteristic of typical SIDS cases and given the specific autopsy findings, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes challenging to attribute the hypoxic damage to a cause consistent with innocence without more information on other potential causes.

Therefore, considering the information and typical understanding of SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death under the condition that Jane is not guilty seems low because the scenario provided does not align well with typical SIDS or other clearly innocent explanations.

**20**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben, and possibly Andy, was due to natural causes or an unexplained phenomenon such as SIDS. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries, was used as evidence against Jane, suggesting that she might have caused the death by smothering.

However, if Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage and other injuries found in Ben need to be explained by other means. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, but it does not typically present with significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain or injuries to the ribs and spinal cord as seen in Ben.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the prosecution's interpretation of the hypoxic damage being caused by smothering a matter of hours before death is not valid. The defense or alternative explanations might argue that the findings could be due to other causes or be misinterpreted.

The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on the prosecution's case that the damage was a result of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, this timeline and cause are not accurate.

However, the actual likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death, independent of the cause (smothering or otherwise), depends on the medical interpretation of the condition of Ben's body and the circumstances surrounding his death. 

Given that Ben's death is being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and if we were to consider alternative explanations, it's essential to understand that hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen. This could be due to various reasons, not just smothering.

The probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, under the condition that Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering), hinges on whether the observed hypoxic damage can be explained by other plausible mechanisms that could occur close to the time of death.

If Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage is not typical for SIDS. Thus, if Jane is not guilty and the damage is still present, there needs to be an alternative explanation for both the damage and the death.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, without specifying the cause, relates to the interpretation of the autopsy findings and the medical understanding of how such damage occurs and is timed.

Given the information and the need to assess the likelihood under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we must consider that the prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation that the hypoxic damage was due to smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and the damage is still considered to have occurred shortly before death, it challenges the typical understanding of SIDS or other natural causes.

The final probability judgment should reflect the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death under any circumstance, not necessarily tied to Jane's guilt or innocence directly but considering alternative explanations.

Given the lack of detailed medical alternative explanations in the scenario for the observed injuries and the condition of Ben, and considering that hypoxic damage does indicate a lack of oxygen which could occur shortly before death due to various reasons, the probability judgment leans towards a moderate to high likelihood if we are to consider that such damage could occur due to reasons other than smothering.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The pathophysiology behind SIDS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of environmental and intrinsic factors that affect an infant's ability to compensate for stresses during sleep. 

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could be interpreted in a couple of ways in the context of SIDS or a similar syndrome. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically does not have a clear cause identified post-mortem, some infants who die from SIDS may have evidence of prior hypoxia or stress. However, the specific timing of when hypoxic damage occurred relative to death is crucial in understanding its implications.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions. In the case of SIDS, the death is sudden and unexplained, and it is possible that some form of hypoxic episode or stress could have occurred close to the time of death.

However, the doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death implies an acute event or a significant stressor leading to hypoxia. 

If we are to consider that Jane is not guilty and that the death could be due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the fact that Ben had hypoxic damage to the brain a matter of hours before death might seem less directly related to an acute abusive act like smothering. Instead, it could be seen as part of the complex pathophysiology leading to SIDS, although the exact mechanisms and timing are not well-defined.

Given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and the presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as part of the spectrum of findings in infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly, if Jane is not guilty, one might argue that the hypoxic damage could still be part of the natural disease process or an unexplained event.

However, the specific claim that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" as a significant and notable event may not be directly aligned with the typical understanding of SIDS, where death is sudden and without clear antecedent cause.

To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to weigh the plausibility of SIDS or a similar condition causing such damage against the prosecution's implied timeline and causation.

The information given does not directly link the timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS cases to being "a matter of hours before death" in a way that is universally accepted or understood within the medical or legal community.

Therefore, assessing the probability requires considering the uncertainty around SIDS and its pathophysiology. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or a similar natural cause for Ben's death, the fact that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death might be seen as less likely to be directly related to an external act like smothering but could still be part of an unexplained process.

Given the lack of clear evidence linking the timing of hypoxic damage directly to SIDS or ruling out other causes, and considering the complexities of SIDS, a moderate probability might be assigned to the event if we are to assume Jane's innocence and attribute the death to SIDS or a related condition.

**50**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by Jane. In this context, considering an alternative explanation such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is relevant. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature.

The autopsy findings for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are significant. If these findings are interpreted in the context of SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering, it's essential to understand that SIDS typically does not present with such specific pathological findings indicative of significant trauma or asphyxia.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain suggests a period of oxygen deprivation. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering that the death might be due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a critical point of discussion.

However, the presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic brain damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, and ocular hemorrhages is not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS. These findings suggest some form of insult or event that led to the hypoxia.

The question is about the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty. 

If we are to assume Jane's innocence and consider SIDS or a similar condition, the pathological findings for Ben are not entirely consistent with typical SIDS due to the presence of significant trauma or asphyxia-like changes. 

However, given that we are exploring the scenario where Jane is not guilty, and thus potentially looking for alternative explanations, it's also worth noting that the exact timing of hypoxic damage can be difficult to determine with precision based solely on autopsy findings.

If Ben's death was due to a natural cause or an accident not related to Jane's actions, the hypoxic damage could have occurred at any time before death, depending on the nature of the cause.

Given the information and the need to assess the likelihood under the assumption of Jane's innocence, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) of the hypoxic damage as suggested by the doctor could be evaluated in the context of possible natural or accidental causes.

The autopsy findings do suggest a significant event or condition leading to hypoxia. The critical issue is whether this is compatible with a non-criminal explanation.

60
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by Jane. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a significant event or condition that led to asphyxia or oxygen deprivation.

The hypothesis that these findings are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma is based on the interpretation that such injuries are typically associated with non-accidental or inflicted trauma. 

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for these findings. While SIDS is considered as an alternative cause of death, the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case (hypoxic brain damage and ocular hemorrhages) are not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

Other natural or accidental causes could potentially explain some of these findings, but they are not typical. For instance, certain infections or medical conditions can cause some similar symptoms, but the constellation of findings in Ben's case is unusual and not characteristic of common natural causes.

Given the unusual nature of the autopsy findings for a natural or accidental death, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and ocular hemorrhages) occurring without any foul play is low. 

This is because the findings strongly suggest a significant and potentially asphyxial event, which is not characteristic of typical SIDS or most other natural causes of infant death.

The probability judgment reflects the likelihood of these findings occurring under the assumption of Jane's innocence.

20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted harm by Jane. The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of significant trauma or abuse.

A torn frenulum, in particular, is often associated with non-accidental injury in infants, as it can be caused by a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. Bruises on the arms and legs can also be indicative of trauma, although they can occur accidentally. Blood in the lung can be associated with a variety of causes, including infection, trauma, or asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. While it is possible that some of these findings could be due to accidental trauma or underlying medical conditions, the combination of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is unusual and not typical for a straightforward accidental injury or a natural cause of death like SIDS.

However, it's also worth noting that the original autopsy did not initially identify these findings, and they were only discovered upon re-examination. This could suggest that the initial examination might have missed some subtle signs or that the re-examination was more thorough.

Given the assumption of Jane's innocence, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring without any foul play is considered low because they are indicative of significant trauma. However, it's not impossible that a combination of accidental injuries or undiagnosed medical conditions could potentially result in some of these findings.

The probability judgment reflects the likelihood of these findings under the assumption of Jane's innocence.

10
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to any form of inflicted harm by Jane. The similarities between the two incidents include the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died (after being fed), and the circumstance that Jane was alone with them when they were found unconscious.

The similarity in age can be considered a coincidence, as both babies were infants and SIDS or other natural causes can occur within a specific age range.

The fact that both babies died after being fed and at a similar time of day could be related to various factors, including the natural rhythms of infant behavior and the timing of feedings, which can be somewhat routine.

However, the combination of these factors (age, time of day, and circumstance of being found by Jane while alone with them) being so similar is noteworthy. If we consider that both deaths were due to natural causes or accidents, the similarity in circumstances (being found unconscious by Jane while she was alone with them) might be less about Jane's actions and more about the coincidence of their deaths occurring under similar conditions.

The probability of these similarities occurring by chance, given that Jane is not guilty and assuming both deaths were due to natural causes or unrelated accidents, is not extremely high but is plausible due to the various factors that could contribute to such coincidences.

However, the specific combination and the number of similarities (age, time of day, and being alone with Jane) make it less likely to be a mere coincidence.

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of inflicted injury by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS and Associated Findings**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally not characteristic of SIDS. These findings are typically associated with non-accidental injury.

2. **Re-examination Findings and Their Implications**: The findings from Andy's re-examination are indicative of possible non-accidental injury. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often associated with a significant force applied to the mouth, which could be indicative of forced feeding or, more relevantly, smothering. Bruises and blood in the lung are also not typical of SIDS.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the observed injuries were either misinterpreted or not related to her actions. However, the presence of such significant signs of potential abuse (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in a baby is highly unusual for a SIDS death.

4. **Probability Consideration**: The likelihood of these findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) in a case of SIDS is very low because they are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically not associated with significant external or internal injuries suggestive of trauma.

Given the information and the context that these findings are not typical for SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (and thus the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause), the probability of observing these specific injuries is low.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's examine the possibility that these injuries could occur in the context of a SIDS death or accidental circumstances.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can occur due to various reasons, including accidental injury, birth trauma, or handling by others (e.g., during resuscitation attempts). However, in the context of SIDS or an otherwise natural death, significant bruising might be less common but is not entirely unheard of, particularly if there was some form of resuscitation or handling that could cause bruising.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: The presence of blood in the lung could be indicative of trauma or could be related to attempts at resuscitation. In infants, this could also be seen in the context of infection or other pathologies.

If Jane is not guilty, then the implication is that the deaths of Andy and Ben might be due to SIDS or some other natural or accidental cause. The literature on SIDS suggests that it is not typically associated with significant trauma or abuse. However, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

The crucial aspect here is understanding that the re-examination findings were based on autopsy photographs of Andy, which might not always provide a clear or comprehensive picture of the injuries. 

If we consider that Jane is not guilty and that Andy's death was potentially due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) might be unexpected but not entirely impossible. For example, resuscitation attempts can sometimes cause such injuries.

However, the injuries described are generally considered indicative of non-accidental trauma. The probability of these findings occurring in the absence of smothering or abuse, and assuming SIDS or a similar natural cause, is relatively low because these injuries are not typical of SIDS.

Given the context and the nature of the injuries, and considering alternative explanations, we need to provide a probability judgment.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane is presumed not to have smothered Andy.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not necessarily related to smothering or abuse, such as accidental injury. However, in the context of a very young infant like Andy, significant bruising is unusual and typically raises concerns about possible non-accidental injury.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the upper gum) can be indicative of trauma to the mouth, which could be due to a non-accidental injury. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common in infants who are not yet mobile.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or other medical conditions.

If Jane is not guilty of smothering Andy, we must consider whether these findings could be related to other causes or if they are still indicative of smothering or abuse, which would be inconsistent with her not being guilty.

However, the presence of these findings does not directly equate to smothering or abuse. There could be other explanations, though they are not specified here.

In cases of SIDS, autopsy findings are typically minimal or absent, and significant injuries like those described are not characteristic of SIDS. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (and assuming the injuries are not fabricated or misinterpreted), we need to evaluate the likelihood of these findings occurring in the context of a SIDS death or other natural/inconspicuous causes.

Since the described injuries are not typical for SIDS and suggest some form of trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it's challenging to directly attribute these findings to a natural cause or SIDS without further evidence or alternative explanations.

Given the scenario and the nature of the injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy would still have these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is low because they are not typical of SIDS or accidental death in a non-mobile infant.

The probability judgment is: **20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination of his autopsy.
The re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are presented as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the death of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering or abuse. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of trauma or abuse.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of these injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or accidental death.
SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While SIDS deaths are sudden and unexpected, the presence of significant injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not typical for SIDS. These findings suggest some form of trauma.

## Step 5: Consider the likelihood of accidental injuries that could result in the observed findings.
Accidental injuries can occur, but the specific combination of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is concerning for non-accidental injury. However, some of these could potentially occur accidentally, though it's less common for them to all be present together due to accident.

## Step 6: Relate the given injuries to the probability of them occurring if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, we are looking at the scenario where Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse by Jane. The injuries found could still be present due to other reasons, but their presence is unusual in the context of SIDS.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood based on the understanding that the injuries are not typical for SIDS but could potentially occur due to other reasons.
The injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the presence of these injuries would generally lead investigators to consider other causes.

## Step 8: Consider the overall context and known statistics or medical understanding regarding SIDS and infant injuries.
While the exact probability of such injuries occurring in a SIDS death is not directly quantifiable from the given information, it's understood that significant traumatic injuries are not typical for SIDS.

## Step 9: Make a judgment based on the information provided and the context of SIDS.
Given that the injuries are indicative of trauma and not typical for SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death was not due to her action), the likelihood of these specific injuries being present due to other accidental or non-SIDS natural causes is low.

## Step 10: Provide a probability judgment.
The presence of significant injuries like bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, if Jane is not guilty, suggests that these findings are unlikely to be coincidental or part of a SIDS death scenario. However, quantifying this exactly requires understanding that these injuries are not characteristic of SIDS.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can be indicative of physical abuse but can also occur accidentally. Infants are prone to bruising due to their fragile skin and the fact that they are still learning to navigate their environment. However, bruising in non-mobile infants (those who are not yet able to move around on their own) is considered unusual and warrants further investigation.

2. **Torn frenulum**: The frenulum is a piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum. A torn frenulum can be a sign of abuse, typically resulting from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be indicative of significant trauma or infection. In the context of an infant death, it could suggest violent or forceful actions against the child.

If Jane is not guilty, then the implication is that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS.

SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of evidence of significant trauma or other clear causes of death upon autopsy. While SIDS can occur, the specific findings in Andy's re-examined autopsy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, we would expect these specific autopsy findings to be less likely because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other natural causes of death in infants.

However, it's also possible that some of these findings could be misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause that was not immediately apparent.

Given these considerations, the likelihood of observing these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because they are not typical for SIDS or other natural/accidental causes.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the incidents involving Andy and Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these similarities could occur by chance or due to other factors.

The similarities mentioned are:
1. Both babies were about the same age when they died.
2. They both died at a similar time of day after just being fed.
3. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that both deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

1. **Same age at death**: SIDS can occur at any age within the first year, but it peaks between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died within this general age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which is plausible given the age distribution of SIDS.

2. **Similar time of day and after feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time. However, some studies suggest that SIDS might be more common during certain times of the day, potentially related to sleep patterns. Being found after feeding could be coincidental or related to the typical care routine.

3. **Found unconscious by Jane when alone**: Given that Jane was the primary caregiver, it's not surprising that she was alone with the babies when they were found unconscious, as caregivers often are during infant care.

The combination of these factors might seem unusual at first glance. However, the key is understanding that if both deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, some similarities in circumstances (like being found by a caregiver) are not necessarily suspicious.

The probability that both infants died of SIDS or a similar cause and shared some circumstantial similarities (age, time of day, being found by Jane) is difficult to quantify directly. However, the fact that both were found by Jane when she was alone is not particularly unusual given she was their caregiver.

The similarities between the two incidents can be partly attributed to the similar ages of the infants and the caregiving circumstances. Given that SIDS has an element of unpredictability and can occur under various circumstances, some level of similarity in the context of their deaths (e.g., being found by a caregiver) is not entirely unexpected.

Therefore, while the exact probability is hard to quantify, the fact that Jane was the caregiver and was alone with both babies when they were found is not in itself highly improbable. However, the combination of all these similarities might still be considered relatively low probability if one assumes that the deaths were independent events due to natural causes like SIDS.

Probability judgment: 30
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the medical evidence and the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. If Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways.

1. **SIDS**: The pathophysiology of SIDS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of factors that affect the infant's ability to maintain homeostasis, potentially leading to a failure of autoresuscitation mechanisms. Hypoxic damage could be a part of the agonal process in SIDS, but the timing and nature of such damage can be difficult to determine.

2. **Other natural causes**: Other natural causes of death might also result in hypoxic damage.

The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion based on the analysis of Ben's condition. 

If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is a medical interpretation that suggests an event or process occurring shortly before death.

The likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether the medical evidence supports this timeline in the context of a natural death.

SIDS can involve a rapid progression to death, and some cases might involve agonal changes that could be interpreted as occurring shortly before death. However, attributing the exact timing of hypoxic damage to a matter of hours before death in the context of SIDS or another natural cause might not be straightforward without clear evidence of a specific cause.

Therefore, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty depends on the interpretation of the medical evidence. If the medical evidence is considered reliable and suggests that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death, this could be seen as less likely under the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, as it might imply a more acute event rather than a sudden, unexplained death.

Probability judgment: 40
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these findings are consistent with SIDS or other natural causes of death.

The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is generally considered indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and potential trauma or stress.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: While hypoxic damage can occur in various contexts, including SIDS, the presence of such damage is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. SIDS deaths are generally characterized by a lack of significant pathological findings.

2. **Hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are often associated with significant stress or trauma, such as that caused by smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is less likely. SIDS is typically characterized by an absence of significant pathological changes, and the presence of such findings might suggest an alternative explanation.

While it's not impossible for some natural conditions or accidental causes to result in similar findings, the combination of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more commonly associated with non-accidental injury or asphyxia rather than SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing these specific findings is relatively low because they are not typical for SIDS or most other natural causes of death in infants.

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we first need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS and its Implications**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion given when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation. The presence of risk factors can increase the likelihood of SIDS, but these factors do not directly cause it.

2. **Assessing the Injuries Found in Andy**: The injuries described (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. A torn frenulum, for example, is commonly linked to a significant force being applied to the mouth, which can be indicative of a violent or forced action such as smothering.

3. **Considering the Alternative - SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths could be attributed to SIDS, we need to consider whether the injuries could be related to SIDS or another cause unrelated to smothering.

4. **SIDS and the Found Injuries**: SIDS by definition is unexplained and doesn't directly cause injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. Such findings typically suggest trauma or abuse. However, it's also possible for infants to have pre-existing or coincidental conditions that might be misinterpreted.

5. **Evaluating the Probability**: 
    - The presence of bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung strongly suggests non-accidental injury. 
    - SIDS does not typically present with such findings.
    - If Jane is not guilty, one would have to argue that these findings either occurred by accident or were not related to her actions.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that Andy would have these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) coincidentally or due to another cause unrelated to smothering or abuse is low. 

The injuries described are not characteristic of SIDS but rather of non-accidental injury. Therefore, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for the injuries), we are left with a scenario where these injuries would be an unexplained coincidence or misattributed.

The probability that these injuries occurred in the context of Jane being not guilty (and the death potentially being SIDS or another natural cause) is relatively low due to the nature of the injuries being more indicative of non-accidental trauma.

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the initial diagnosis of Andy's death as being due to natural causes and the later findings that suggested potential smothering or abuse. If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in both Andy and Ben should be explained by other factors.

The findings in Ben, which included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were initially thought to be indicative of smothering or severe abuse. However, similar injuries were later found in Andy upon re-examination. 

If Jane is not guilty, we have to consider alternative explanations for these injuries. One possibility is that both infants died of natural causes or SIDS, and the injuries were either misinterpreted or not directly related to the cause of death.

The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK. While SIDS can occur, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical characteristics associated with SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

However, it's known that some infants who die of SIDS may have minor injuries or marks that can be misinterpreted. Resuscitation attempts, for example, can cause rib injuries or other marks on the body.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we're looking at the likelihood of these findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) occurring in the context of a natural death or SIDS. The literature suggests that some of these findings can occur in SIDS or during resuscitation attempts.

The presence of a torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, but it's not exclusive to it. The other findings, like bruises and blood in the lung, could potentially be related to other factors, including possible resuscitation attempts or other natural causes.

However, the specific combination and nature of these findings (especially a torn frenulum) are generally considered to be indicative of some form of trauma.

If we are to assume Jane is not guilty and that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, we would expect the probability of these specific injuries to be low because they are not typical of SIDS.

Therefore, considering the information and the condition that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy occurring coincidentally or due to other non-criminal factors is low.

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

1. **Understanding SIDS and its Implications**: SIDS is defined as a sudden, unexplained death in infancy. It is diagnosed after ruling out other possible causes of death. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically associated with an absence of significant findings at autopsy.

2. **Considering Alternative Explanations for the Findings**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of trauma or accidental injury. However, in the context of an 11-week-old infant who was found dead without a clear cause, these findings raise suspicion of non-accidental injury.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is often considered indicative of non-accidental injury, as it typically results from a significant force applied to the mouth, such as a blow or forced feeding.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This can be associated with various conditions, including infection or trauma. In an infant, it can be a sign of severe respiratory distress or injury.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty of smothering Andy, we need to consider whether these findings can be explained by natural causes or accidents. 
   - The findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally not associated with SIDS. SIDS cases typically do not show significant autopsy findings that would explain death.
   - For an innocent explanation (i.e., Jane not being guilty), one would need to hypothesize that these findings are either misinterpreted or resulted from an accidental or natural cause not related to smothering or abuse.

4. **Interpreting the Findings**:
   - The presence of a torn frenulum and bruises is highly suggestive of non-accidental injury. 
   - The overall picture of significant autopsy findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) is not typical for SIDS.

**Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing these specific autopsy findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy due to natural or accidental causes unrelated to smothering is low. The findings are suggestive of non-accidental injury, making it less probable that they occurred in the absence of abuse or smothering.

**Probability Judgment: 10**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, particularly in the context of the given scenario where SIDS is a possible explanation for the death of both Andy and Ben.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of potential non-accidental injury. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. Blood in the lung could be indicative of suffocation or other forms of trauma.

2. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: SIDS is diagnosed when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. By definition, SIDS does not have a clear cause or identifiable pathology at post-mortem examination that explains the death. Smothering, on the other hand, involves asphyxia due to obstruction of the mouth and/or nose and is considered a form of non-accidental injury when inflicted.

3. **Re-examination Findings and SIDS**: The re-examination findings for Andy, which were not initially reported, suggest possible non-accidental injury. However, if Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be explained by other factors or if they necessarily imply smothering or abuse.

4. **Probability Assessment**: The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are unusual in SIDS cases. SIDS deaths are not typically associated with such significant pathological findings indicative of trauma. 

5. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: 
    - **Accidental Injury**: It's possible, though less likely, that such injuries could have occurred accidentally. For instance, a torn frenulum can occur with accidental trauma (e.g., a fall onto a hard surface), though this is less likely for the combination of findings observed.
    - **Misinterpretation or Artefact**: Post-mortem changes or artefactual changes during handling or autopsy could potentially explain some findings.

6. **Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, we would expect the findings in Andy to be either accidental or artefactual. However, given the nature of the findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), they are not typical for SIDS or post-mortem artefacts alone. 

7. **Assessing Probability**: The probability that these findings are present in Andy if Jane is not guilty involves assessing whether there are plausible alternative explanations for the injuries that are not related to smothering or abuse. While not entirely impossible, it is unlikely that such specific and significant signs of trauma are either coincidental or artefactual.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the observed findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy by accident or other non-criminal factors is relatively low, as these are more indicative of non-accidental injury.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors, such as sleeping on the stomach or side, exposure to smoke, and overheating.

2. **Injuries Indicative of Smothering or Abuse**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can be indicative of non-accidental injury or abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often associated with a significant force or trauma to the mouth.

3. **Relevance to SIDS**: The injuries described (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically not associated with significant external or internal injuries that would suggest trauma or abuse.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering or abusing her children, then the presence of such injuries in Andy would be coincidental or due to another cause not related to Jane's actions. 

5. **Alternative Explanations for the Injuries**: While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental injuries, the combination of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma. 

6. **Probability Judgment**: Given that Jane is not guilty implies that the deaths were due to natural or accidental causes. The specific injuries mentioned are not typical of SIDS or accidental injuries that one might expect in an infant's death categorized under SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely to expect these specific injuries.

Considering these points, the injuries observed in Andy are not typical for SIDS or natural/accidental causes that would be expected if Jane were not guilty. Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries being present if Jane is not guilty is low, as they are indicative of trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To determine the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's examine the given information and the implications of Jane not being guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm inflicted by Jane.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not necessarily related to abuse, such as accidental injury or handling by others (e.g., medical personnel during resuscitation attempts). However, in the context of a post-mortem examination of an infant, the presence of bruises might still be scrutinized for potential non-accidental injury.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible for such injuries to occur accidentally, although this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of several conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or resuscitation efforts.

If Jane is not guilty, we have to consider that the findings could either be misinterpreted or have alternative explanations not related to smothering or abuse. The condition described in Ben's autopsy (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) strongly suggests non-accidental injury, but this does not directly imply that Andy's death was also due to non-accidental injury.

However, the question is about the likelihood of the specific findings in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is not guilty.

- The presence of these findings is highly indicative of non-accidental injury according to many medical professionals.
- If Jane is not guilty, we must consider that these findings might be either:
  a. Misinterpreted or not accurately representative of the circumstances surrounding Andy's death.
  b. Due to some other cause not related to Jane's actions.

The frequency and combination of these findings are not typical for SIDS or natural causes. Research and clinical experience suggest that such a constellation of injuries is strongly associated with non-accidental trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy is low because they are indicative of non-accidental injury.

### Probability Judgment
Given that Jane is not guilty implies that the injuries were not inflicted by her, the probability that Andy would still have these injuries is low because they are indicative of non-accidental trauma. However, we are assessing the probability of these findings occurring under the assumption of Jane's innocence.

**10**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse inflicted by Jane.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to various reasons not related to abuse, such as accidental injury or conditions that cause bruising. However, in the context of a very young infant with no reported history of accidental injury, these findings are unusual.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with a significant force applied to the mouth area, typically seen in cases of abuse where the mouth is forcibly covered or there is a direct blow to the mouth. However, it's also possible for a torn frenulum to occur accidentally, though this is less common in infants who are not yet mobile.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection, congenital issues, or injury. In the context of an infant death, it could be related to the cause of death or an agonal event (occurring at or around the time of death).

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is unexpected and not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is defined as a sudden, unexplained death, and while the exact cause is unknown, it is not typically associated with signs of trauma like bruising or internal injuries.

However, it's worth noting that some infants might have conditions or suffer events that could result in similar findings without being due to abuse. For example, birth trauma, accidents, or undiagnosed medical conditions could potentially explain some of these findings.

Given the information and the context that Jane is not guilty, we are essentially being asked to assess the likelihood of significant injuries being present in Andy if his death was not due to smothering or abuse by Jane.

The presence of such injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in an infant who died supposedly from SIDS or another natural cause is unusual and warrants further investigation. While it's not impossible that such findings could be coincidental or due to other factors, they are not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, considering the implausibility of these findings in the context of a death attributed to natural causes or SIDS, and without more detailed information on alternative explanations for these injuries, the likelihood is considered to be low.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the alternative explanation provided, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS and its Implications**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion given when the death of an infant under one year of age remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of certain autopsy findings can sometimes be misinterpreted or can be coincidental with SIDS.

2. **Analyzing the Findings**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of trauma or abuse but can also occur accidentally. However, in the context of SIDS or natural death, such bruises might be less expected unless there's an explanation (like accidental injury).
   - **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if it's not clearly explained by an accidental cause. However, it's worth noting that minor injuries can sometimes be misinterpreted.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental injury, or other causes.

3. **Relevance to SIDS**: The provided findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally not characteristic of SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis made when there's no clear cause of death found after thorough investigation. While SIDS deaths can sometimes have minor or unrelated findings at autopsy, the presence of these specific findings might suggest an alternative explanation.

4. **Assessing Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty (i.e., if she did not smother her children), the likelihood of these findings in Andy would be related to other possible causes or explanations. 
   - The bruises and torn frenulum could potentially be due to accidental injury or other medical conditions. 
   - Blood in the lung could be due to a variety of causes not related to smothering.

However, the specific combination of these findings is unusual and not typically associated with SIDS or natural infant death. 

5. **Quantifying the Likelihood**: To quantify the likelihood of these findings in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we consider that these findings are not typical for SIDS or natural causes and are more suggestive of some form of trauma or injury.

Given the information, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are present due to other causes or are misinterpreted is relatively low because they are not typical for SIDS and are suggestive of possible non-accidental injury.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and possible explanations for these findings.

1. **Context and Alternative Explanations**: The injuries found in Andy could be indicative of abuse, but they could also have other explanations. For instance, bruises can occur due to accidental injury, a torn frenulum can result from a fall or other accidents, and blood in the lung could be due to various medical conditions or resuscitation efforts.

2. **SIDS vs. Smothering**: The presence of these injuries makes the diagnosis of SIDS less likely for both Andy and Ben because SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of evidence of significant trauma or other cause of death upon autopsy. The re-examination findings suggest that Andy's death might not have been due to SIDS alone.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or intentional harm by her. The injuries found could still be due to other factors such as accidental injury, other forms of non-intentional harm, or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings.

4. **Probability of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: The key question is whether these injuries are likely to occur in the absence of Jane's guilt (i.e., without smothering or intentional harm by Jane). The injuries could be coincidental or due to other causes.

However, given that the original post-mortem suggested natural causes and the re-examination was prompted by the suspicious nature of Ben's death, it's plausible that the re-examination was more thorough or looked for signs that might not have been initially considered significant.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would depend on whether these could be explained by accidental or other non-suspicious causes.

The presence of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not typical for a straightforward SIDS case, which usually lacks significant pathological findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that Andy had these injuries would be lower than if she were guilty (since the injuries are associated with the prosecution's case against her). However, the exact probability is difficult to quantify without more context on alternative explanations for these findings.

Given the complexity and the need to provide a numeric judgment:

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or abuse by Jane.

First, let's examine the findings:

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of accidental injury or, in the context of a baby, potentially indicative of some form of trauma or abuse. However, accidental injuries can occur even in non-abusive environments.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered a significant indicator of potential abuse because it can be caused by a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible for this injury to occur accidentally, though it's less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or asphyxiation.

If Jane is not guilty, we have to consider the possibility that these findings are either misinterpreted or have an alternative explanation not related to smothering or abuse by Jane. SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths, but the presence of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not typically characteristic of SIDS.

However, it's crucial to understand that the presence of these injuries doesn't necessarily link directly to smothering but rather indicates some form of trauma or injury. SIDS is generally defined by the absence of a clear cause of death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The likelihood of these specific findings occurring in the context of SIDS or another natural cause is relatively low because they suggest some form of significant trauma or injury. However, it's possible that some of these findings could be misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation for the deaths and injuries, we must consider how likely it is for these injuries to occur coincidentally or through other non-criminal means.

The injuries found in Andy could be due to various causes, and it's challenging to attribute them directly to SIDS. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we are left to consider the probability of these findings occurring without smothering or intentional harm.

The specific probability is difficult to quantify due to the complex nature of infant deaths and the range of possible explanations for the observed injuries. However, considering that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and that these findings are not typical for SIDS, we are left to evaluate the likelihood based on the assumption that there might be an alternative, non-criminal explanation.

Given the information provided and the complexity of attributing the exact cause of the observed injuries, a precise numerical probability is challenging to determine without more specific data on the incidence of such findings in SIDS or other non-suspicious infant deaths.

However, for the sake of providing a judgment as requested:

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury in infants. A torn frenulum is often associated with a blow to the mouth. However, the presence of such injuries does not exclusively indicate smothering or murder; they could result from other forms of abuse or, less commonly, accidental injury.

2. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be explained by other factors, including accidental injury or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings. However, the specific combination of injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is often considered strong evidence of non-accidental injury.

3. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Autopsy Findings**: SIDS is diagnosed when the cause of death remains unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some infants who die from SIDS may have minor pathological findings, significant injuries like those described are not typical for SIDS. SIDS does not usually present with significant trauma or internal injuries.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of finding significant injuries indicative of abuse (like bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would be low. These findings are generally not associated with SIDS.

Given the information and the condition that Jane is not guilty (implying that the death could be due to SIDS or another natural/accidental cause), the presence of these specific injuries is unusual and not characteristic of a typical SIDS death.

Therefore, considering the context that Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that Andy would have these specific injuries if his death was due to a natural cause like SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane is presumed not to have smothered or abused Andy.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can occur due to various reasons, not solely due to abuse. Accidental injuries, birth trauma, or conditions that affect blood clotting can cause bruising. However, in the context of an 11-week-old infant who was found to have died suddenly and was initially thought to have died of natural causes, significant bruising might be less likely to be attributed to accidental injury.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered indicative of non-accidental injury, particularly if it is associated with other signs of trauma. The frenulum is a piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum. A tear in this area can occur due to a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. In infants, this is often seen as a red flag for abuse. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: The presence of blood in the lung could be due to various factors, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or other medical conditions. In the context of an infant death, it could be related to the cause of death or a pathological condition.

If Jane is not guilty of smothering or abusing Andy, we have to consider that these findings might be either misinterpreted or related to other causes. However, the presence of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is generally considered to be indicative of non-accidental injury.

The alternative explanation given is SIDS, which is by definition a diagnosis of exclusion when no other cause of death can be found after thorough investigation. SIDS does not typically present with the kind of injuries described.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries might have been misinterpreted or not related to her actions. However, based on the information provided and the typical interpretation of such injuries in forensic pathology, their presence is unusual in the context of SIDS.

The likelihood of these findings in a case where Jane is not guilty (and thus, presumably, the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause) is low because these specific findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To address this question, we must consider the context and the information given. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse inflicted by her. The alternative explanation provided for their deaths is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

First, let's examine the findings related to Andy's death upon re-examination: bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are often considered indicative of non-accidental injury.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants is uncommon due to their limited mobility and lack of exposure to trauma. However, bruising can occur accidentally, though it's less common in non-mobile infants. The presence of bruising might suggest some form of trauma, but it's also possible for bruises to occur accidentally or be misinterpreted.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum) can be indicative of trauma, often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This can be a sign of significant trauma or other severe conditions, potentially indicating that the infant was subjected to some form of force or injury that led to bleeding within the lungs.

If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that Andy's death was due to natural or accidental causes, potentially SIDS. SIDS, by definition, is a sudden and unexplained death. The presence of the described injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) complicates the attribution of Andy's death to SIDS, as these are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically without significant findings on autopsy.

The likelihood of finding such significant injuries in a case of SIDS is low because SIDS is defined by the lack of a clear cause of death upon thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of these injuries suggests that Andy might have experienced some form of trauma.

However, it's also possible to consider that some of these findings could be misinterpreted or that there might be alternative explanations for them that are not related to intentional harm (e.g., accidental trauma, resuscitation artifacts, etc.).

Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming the alternative explanation is SIDS or some other non-criminal cause, the probability of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS.

To provide a probability judgment, one must weigh the likelihood of these findings occurring in the context of a non-criminal death like SIDS. The exact probability is difficult to quantify without more specific data on how often such findings occur in SIDS cases or other non-criminal infant deaths.

However, given that these findings are not typical for SIDS and suggest some form of trauma or injury, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and that Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse, the presence of these findings is somewhat anomalous.

The probability judgment should reflect the likelihood of these injuries being present in a scenario where Jane is not guilty (and thus, presumably, Andy's death was due to a cause like SIDS). 

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings. The presence of such injuries is often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these findings could be coincidental or related to another cause.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants is uncommon because they are not yet mobile. However, it's not unheard of for infants to have bruises due to various non-abusive reasons such as birth trauma, medical conditions, or even accidental injury, though the latter is rare in non-mobile infants.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered indicative of NAI, typically resulting from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it can also occur during medical procedures or, rarely, accidentally.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be indicative of significant trauma or other serious conditions. In the context of an infant, it could be related to smothering or other forms of asphyxia, but it could also be related to infection, congenital conditions, or other pathologies.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or another natural cause for Andy's death, the presence of these specific injuries becomes less likely to be directly related to smothering or abuse. However, it's crucial to understand that some of these findings (like bruising and a torn frenulum) could still be present due to other reasons.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings being present due to smothering or related to her guilt is zero. However, we're tasked with assessing their likelihood in the context of her innocence.

SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. Some studies have found that a small percentage of SIDS cases may have minor injuries or other findings that could be misinterpreted as indicative of abuse. However, the presence of significant injuries like a torn frenulum and blood in the lung would typically lead investigators to consider these as non-SIDS deaths.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, we are looking at the likelihood of these findings occurring coincidentally or due to other natural or accidental causes. The exact probability is challenging to quantify without specific data on how often such findings occur in SIDS or other natural deaths.

However, given the specific nature of the injuries described and the general understanding that they are more commonly associated with NAI, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are found in Andy due to other causes is relatively low.

Given the context and available information, a reasonable probability judgment reflecting the likelihood of these findings in Andy if Jane is not guilty could be on the lower side.

**Probability Judgment: 10**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's examine the given information and the implications of Jane not being guilty. If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural causes, or possibly accidental injuries not related to smothering or abuse.

The initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death, which could be consistent with SIDS, given that it's a diagnosis often made when other causes are ruled out. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys.

The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs are indicative of potential abuse or trauma. However, the presence of these findings doesn't necessarily mean they were due to smothering or that they were inflicted by Jane.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can be due to various reasons including accidental injury, but in non-mobile infants, significant bruising is unusual and raises concern for abuse. However, it's also possible for bruising to occur accidentally or due to medical conditions.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if there's no clear accidental cause (like a fall onto the mouth). However, it can occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with a variety of causes including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to a cause other than smothering or abuse by Jane (e.g., SIDS or another natural cause), the presence of these findings could be due to other factors or potentially misinterpreted.

However, given that these findings are often associated with non-accidental injury, if we assume Jane is not guilty (implying no abuse by her), we still have to consider how likely these findings are in the context of a death that might be attributed to SIDS or another cause.

SIDS by definition is a sudden and unexplained death, and the presence of these findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) makes the death less likely to be classified simply as SIDS without further explanation.

The probability that these specific findings would be present in a genuine SIDS case (or a case where Jane is not guilty of smothering or abuse) is low because these are indicators of possible trauma.

However, there's a need to consider the possibility that these findings could be misinterpreted or could be related to other causes.

Given the complexity and the need for expert medical interpretation, and without more detailed information on how these findings were evaluated in the context of Andy's overall condition and the circumstances around his death, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

But to directly address the question: if Jane is not guilty, and assuming that implies no smothering or abuse by her, the likelihood of these specific traumatic findings being present is relatively low because they are more commonly associated with trauma or abuse.

Thus, considering the context and assuming an absence of guilt implies an absence of the actions (like smothering) that these findings are typically associated with, the probability of these findings is low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben are not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm caused by her. The alternative explanation provided is that their deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The injuries described (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury. However, the presence of such injuries does not necessarily mean they were inflicted by Jane or that they are directly related to the cause of death.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur accidentally, though in infants, they are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury. However, the presence of bruising can also be seen in cases where there is no abuse, especially if there was some medical intervention or accidental injury.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the gum) is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if it's due to a direct blow or forceful feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or non-accidental injury.

The critical question is whether these findings are consistent with a SIDS death or if they are more indicative of another cause. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion made when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of significant injuries such as those described would typically exclude a death from being classified as SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause, we would not expect to see evidence of significant non-accidental injury. Therefore, the presence of these injuries would be unexpected under the hypothesis that Jane is innocent and that the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause.

However, the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed these injuries, suggesting that the initial assessment might have missed these details, or they were not considered significant at the time.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider the likelihood of these injuries occurring in the context of a SIDS death or another natural cause. The presence of such injuries makes SIDS or other natural causes less likely as the primary explanation, as SIDS does not typically involve significant trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes (not related to Jane's guilt) is low because these are not typical findings in SIDS.

The probability judgment is: **20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings and their likelihood.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can be due to various causes. While it can be indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI), it's also possible for infants to bruise due to accidental injury or natural disease processes, though these are less common.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered indicative of NAI, particularly if it's associated with other signs of trauma. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection, congenital conditions, or injury.

If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these findings needs an alternative explanation. One possible explanation is that these were misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause. However, the presence of multiple indicators (bruising, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) makes an accidental or natural cause less likely, as these findings collectively point towards a significant traumatic event.

Another possibility, if Jane is not guilty, is that these findings could be artifactual or misinterpreted. For instance, post-mortem changes or the handling of the body post-mortem could potentially cause or mimic some of these findings.

However, given the specifics of the case (the re-examination findings in light of the suspicious circumstances surrounding Ben's death), if Jane is not guilty, it suggests that either these findings were not indicative of smothering or NAI, or there was an alternative explanation that doesn't involve Jane's guilt.

The probability of these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty involves considering how likely it is that these could occur without smothering or NAI by Jane. If we consider SIDS as an alternative explanation for both deaths, the presence of these signs in Andy (if not due to Jane's actions) is not directly explained by SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly cause such traumatic findings.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative explanation for Andy's death (such as SIDS or an undetermined natural cause), the likelihood of these traumatic findings being present without being indicative of NAI is low.

Given the above considerations, I would rate the likelihood as follows:

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane is assumed not to be the perpetrator of smothering or abuse.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not related to smothering or intentional harm, such as accidental injury during handling or medical procedures. However, their presence, especially if not clearly explained by accidental injury, is often taken as indicative of potential non-accidental injury.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered a sign of non-accidental injury, typically resulting from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or resuscitation efforts. In the context of an infant, it can also be seen as a sign of possible smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and the injuries found could be due to other causes, potentially including SIDS or other natural causes for Andy's death, and potentially an unfortunate series of events or accidents for both deaths.

However, the specific findings of bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS or other natural causes. SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant findings at autopsy.

The re-examination findings in Andy's case, if assumed not to be related to Jane's actions (since we're considering her not guilty), would have to be explained by other factors or considered as potentially misinterpreted.

Given the assumption of Jane's not being guilty and assuming that the injuries could have alternative explanations, it's still challenging to attribute these specific findings to SIDS or natural causes without other supporting evidence.

The probability that these findings occur in Andy if Jane is not guilty would depend on alternative explanations. However, these injuries are generally considered to be indicative of non-accidental trauma.

To give a probability judgment without more specific information about alternative explanations or the context (such as the medical handling of Andy, any accidental injuries that might have occurred), one has to consider the general likelihood of such findings in a SIDS context or other non-traumatic death.

Given the injuries described are typically associated with non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty, we're left to consider how likely these are to occur by other means or be misinterpreted.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not necessarily related to smothering or abuse, such as accidental injury. However, in the context of an infant who was supposedly found dead without a clear indication of how these injuries occurred, their presence is often scrutinized closely.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it typically requires a significant force or trauma to the mouth area. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or non-accidental injury (such as smothering or choking). In infants, the presence of blood in the lung can be a significant finding that requires careful interpretation.

If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's re-examined autopsy photos complicates this interpretation because these findings are not typical for SIDS.

SIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy. The presence of significant injuries (like those described) would generally lead investigators to conclude that the death was not SIDS, as SIDS does not typically involve significant trauma or injury.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the likelihood of finding such significant injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy would be low, as these are not characteristic of SIDS. These findings more commonly suggest some form of trauma or non-accidental injury.

However, it is also worth noting that the original post-mortem suggested natural causes, and it was only upon re-examination that these injuries were noted. This could imply that the injuries were either not visible or not considered significant at the time of the initial autopsy, or they were interpreted differently.

Given the context and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty, we are left to assess the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or another natural/unexplained cause. Since these injuries are not typical for SIDS, their presence is unusual if the death was due to SIDS.

The probability judgment, taking into account the unusual nature of these findings in the context of SIDS or a similar unexplained death, is low.

**20**
To determine the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings, particularly in the context of the given scenario where Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is an alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries described are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. A torn frenulum (the tissue connecting the upper lip to the gum) and bruising can be indicative of trauma, possibly inflicted. Blood in the lung could be related to various causes, including infection, trauma, or other medical conditions.

2. **SIDS and Associated Findings**: SIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While certain autopsy findings can be more common in SIDS (like intrathoracic petechiae), the presence of significant trauma (e.g., bruises, torn frenulum) is not typical for SIDS.

3. **Relevance of the Injuries to SIDS or Accidental Death**: If Jane is not guilty, implying that the deaths were not due to smothering or intentional harm, the presence of such injuries complicates the picture. These injuries are not characteristic of SIDS but could potentially be explained by other accidental or natural causes, though they are not typical.

4. **Assessing the Probability**: 
    - The injuries observed in Andy are not typical for SIDS.
    - There's a possibility that these injuries could have been misinterpreted or not directly related to the cause of death.
    - In cases where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, some injuries might be found that are not directly related to the cause of death but could be incidental or misattributed.

Given that the presence of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not characteristic of SIDS or typical accidental injuries in infants who die of SIDS, and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the death was not due to smothering or abuse), one must consider the possibility that these findings could be due to other rare or less understood conditions or potentially misinterpreted.

However, without a clear alternative explanation that links these injuries directly to a natural cause or accident that is consistent with SIDS or another non-suspicious cause of death, and given that these injuries are more commonly associated with non-accidental trauma, the likelihood of these findings being present in Andy if Jane is not guilty is low.

**Probability Judgment: 10**
## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem describes the case of Jane, who is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The autopsy of Ben showed injuries indicative of possible smothering, which led to a re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs. The re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.

## Step 2: Analyze the findings in Andy's case
The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are considered indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering according to the prosecution's case.

## Step 3: Consider the alternative explanation - SIDS
The problem also mentions SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) as an alternative explanation for the deaths of Andy and Ben. SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of infants during their first year of life, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of the findings if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. We need to assess how likely the observed injuries in Andy are if his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.

## Step 5: Assess the probability of the observed injuries in Andy under the assumption of innocence
The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are typically associated with non-accidental injury. However, it's also possible for infants to suffer injuries or have conditions that might be misinterpreted. If Andy's death was due to SIDS, the presence of these injuries could be coincidental or related to another cause. However, the specific combination and nature of these findings are generally considered to be indicative of non-accidental trauma.

## Step 6: Consider the frequency and characteristics of SIDS
SIDS is more common among boys and has a frequency of 1 in 4,000. However, the presence of specific injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not typically characteristic of SIDS. These findings suggest trauma.

## Step 7: Evaluate the probability
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking at the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy occurring without smothering being the cause. These injuries are not typical for SIDS. The literature suggests that such injuries are more commonly associated with non-accidental trauma.

## Step 8: Determine the likelihood
Since the injuries found in Andy are indicative of non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse), then the presence of these specific injuries would be unexpected.

## Step 9: Conclude on the probability
The probability of observing such injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) in a case where the death is attributed to a natural cause like SIDS is low because these are typically associated with trauma.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination.
The re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are being used as evidence against Jane, suggesting that Andy was smothered.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for Andy's death, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a condition where an infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly, and the cause remains unexplained after thorough investigation. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) and SIDS or smothering.
The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS. SIDS typically does not present with such significant traumatic injuries.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the observed injuries in Andy if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to smothering or any form of abuse by Jane. In this case, the injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) would need to be explained by other means. However, these injuries are not typical of SIDS.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability of the injuries being present in Andy if his death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.
Given that the injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of non-accidental trauma, if Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause, it would be unusual for him to have these injuries. SIDS deaths are not typically associated with such injuries.

## Step 6: Consider the probability of accidentally or coincidentally finding such injuries in an infant who died of SIDS.
The specific injuries mentioned are not characteristic of SIDS. Therefore, if Andy died of SIDS, the presence of these injuries would be unexpected.

## Step 7: Assess the likelihood of these injuries occurring in the context of SIDS.
Since the injuries are indicative of trauma and not typical for SIDS, their presence in Andy would be unlikely if he died of SIDS.

## Step 8: Quantify the likelihood based on the information given and the understanding of SIDS and non-accidental injuries.
The exact probability is difficult to quantify without specific data on the frequency of such injuries in SIDS cases. However, it is understood that such injuries are not characteristic of SIDS, making their occurrence unlikely in the context of SIDS.

## Step 9: Provide a probability judgment.
Given that the injuries are not typical for SIDS and are more indicative of non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse), the likelihood of these specific injuries being present is low because they do not align with the expected presentation of SIDS or natural causes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings and the context provided.

First, let's examine the given information:
1. The initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death.
2. The re-examination, prompted by the suspicious circumstances around Ben's death, found evidence suggestive of abuse (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung).

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by her. There are a few scenarios to consider under the assumption that Jane is not guilty:

1. **SIDS or other natural causes**: The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical findings in SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of these injuries would generally lead investigators to consider other causes.

2. **Accidental injury**: It's possible that Andy suffered accidental injuries that were misinterpreted as signs of smothering or abuse. However, a torn frenulum is often associated with significant force or trauma, such as that from a violent shaking or a direct blow to the mouth, and bruises and blood in the lung also suggest significant trauma.

3. **Misinterpretation of post-mortem changes or other conditions**: Some post-mortem changes or pathological conditions could be misinterpreted as injuries. However, the specific findings mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally considered to be indicative of significant trauma during life.

Given the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and considering the findings indicative of trauma, we must assess the likelihood of these findings occurring in the absence of abuse by Jane. 

If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these specific injuries would be unexpected if attributing the death to SIDS or other natural causes without any foul play. The injuries described are not characteristic of SIDS and suggest that some form of trauma occurred.

However, the question isn't asking us to directly assess Jane's guilt or innocence based on these findings but rather to consider the likelihood of these findings given that she is not guilty.

The likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in a child who died of SIDS or another natural cause is low because these are not typical features of such deaths. 

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS or accidental injury, the presence of these specific findings becomes less likely under SIDS alone, as they are indicative of trauma.

**Probability judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben are not due to smothering or any form of inflicted harm by her. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are typically considered indicative of abuse or non-accidental injury.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants, especially in those who are not yet mobile, is unusual and can be a sign of non-accidental injury. However, it's also possible for infants to sustain accidental injuries, though the nature and location of these bruises might be more typical (e.g., on the forehead).

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum) can occur accidentally, but it is often associated with a significant force or blow to the mouth. In non-mobile infants, this could raise suspicions of abuse.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be due to various reasons, including infection, aspiration, or injury.

The critical point is that these findings were not part of the original autopsy report on Andy but were discovered upon re-examination of autopsy photographs. The initial autopsy suggested natural causes of death.

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for these findings. 

1. **SIDS or natural causes**: The presence of these injuries doesn't directly correlate with SIDS, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion made when no other cause of death can be found after thorough investigation.

2. **Accidental injury or other medical conditions**: It's possible, though potentially unlikely given the nature of the findings, that these injuries were accidental or due to an undiagnosed medical condition.

The key question is how likely these specific injuries are in the context of an infant dying from SIDS or another natural cause. Research and medical literature suggest that some infants who die of SIDS may have minor pathological findings, but the presence of significant injuries like those described is not typical for SIDS.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or most natural causes of death in infants.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these findings being present due to other, non-abusive causes is considered to be relatively low.

**Probability judgment: 10**
## Step 1: Understand the given information and the condition that Jane is NOT GUILTY.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse by Jane. Given this context, we need to consider alternative explanations for their deaths, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

## Step 2: Analyze the findings from the re-examination of Andy's autopsy.
The re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are indicative of trauma or abuse.

## Step 3: Consider the likelihood of these findings in the context of SIDS or accidental death.
SIDS is characterized by a lack of identifiable cause of death after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung suggests trauma, which is not typically associated with SIDS.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the observed injuries if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Andy would need to have an alternative explanation. However, the injuries described (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury.

## Step 5: Evaluate the likelihood of these injuries occurring naturally or accidentally in an infant.
While some of these injuries could potentially occur accidentally, the combination of them is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma. However, the task is to assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, implying we are looking for an alternative to abuse by Jane.

## Step 6: Consider alternative explanations for the injuries.
If Jane is not guilty, one might consider other explanations for the injuries, such as accidental trauma or another perpetrator. However, the specific combination and nature of the injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are typically associated with inflicted injury.

## Step 7: Assess the probability based on the given condition.
Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries are not due to her actions, we must consider how likely these injuries are under alternative explanations. The injuries are strongly indicative of non-accidental trauma. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we must consider other potential causes or explanations, but these are not clearly supported by the information given.

## Step 8: Determine the likelihood of the observed injuries if Jane is innocent.
The presence of significant injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is rare in cases of SIDS or accidental death. These are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

## Step 9: Quantify the probability.
Given the strong association of the described injuries with non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it implies an alternative explanation for these injuries, which is less likely given their nature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The injuries described are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. A torn frenulum is particularly noted in pediatric forensic medicine as it can be indicative of a significant traumatic event, such as a blow to the mouth. Bruises on the arms and legs, while not uncommon in infants who are beginning to move, can also be indicative of trauma. Blood in the lung could be related to various causes, including infection, accident, or non-accidental injury.

2. **Considering Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries and the deaths of both children could be attributed to other factors. For Andy, the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes, and SIDS was mentioned as a possible explanation for both deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not typically associated with the specific injuries described.

3. **Evaluating the Probability**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of some form of trauma. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider whether these findings could be explained by accident or natural causes.

Given the findings are suggestive of non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty, one has to question whether there could be another explanation for these injuries that does not involve her or anyone else intentionally harming the child.

The injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical for SIDS. SIDS does not usually present with such clear signs of trauma. 

If Jane is not guilty of smothering or abusing her children, then the presence of these injuries could potentially be due to other, less likely, explanations. However, the specific combination and nature of these injuries are generally not explained by SIDS or most natural causes.

Given this context and the information that these injuries are typically associated with non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes is low.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes, such as SIDS, rather than smothering.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be due to accidental injury or other non-abusive causes. Infants can bruise easily, and some bruising might be seen in cases where there is no abuse.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with forceful feeding or other forms of abuse. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with a variety of conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or asphyxia due to various causes, not necessarily smothering.

SIDS is, by definition, a diagnosis of exclusion and is not directly associated with specific traumatic injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. The presence of these findings suggests that if Andy's death was due to SIDS (or another natural cause), it was possibly coincidental with or unrelated to these specific pathological findings.

However, the re-examination findings in Andy's case (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are highly suggestive of non-accidental injury (NAI), which complicates the SIDS diagnosis. 

If Jane is not guilty, we are considering a scenario where the injuries might not be due to smothering or abuse. However, the presence of these specific injuries is not typical for SIDS or other natural causes of infant death.

To estimate the likelihood of these findings in Andy if Jane is not guilty, one must weigh the possibility that these injuries could have occurred accidentally or through other non-abusive means against the context provided.

The injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) found upon re-examination are highly indicative of non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that these findings might need an alternative, less likely explanation.

The probability judgment should reflect the likelihood of observing these specific pathological findings in a scenario where Jane is not guilty (i.e., the deaths and injuries are not due to smothering or abuse by Jane).

Given the strong association of these findings with non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty and the injuries are not due to her actions, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low.

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of physical trauma, but they could also result from other causes such as accidents or even resuscitation attempts. However, in the context of a baby who was supposed to have died from natural causes, their presence is suspicious. If Jane is not guilty, it means the death and injuries could be unrelated to her actions, potentially suggesting an accidental or unexplained cause.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered a significant indicator of potential non-accidental injury, as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible, though less likely, for a frenulum to tear due to other reasons.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or other medical conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, we're essentially exploring the possibility that these findings could occur without her having caused them through smothering or other abusive means. 

The alternative explanation provided is SIDS. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly explain the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. These findings are more commonly associated with trauma or abuse rather than SIDS.

The literature and medical understanding suggest that findings like bruises, torn frenulum, and internal injuries are not typical for SIDS. While SIDS is unpredictable and can occur in otherwise healthy infants, the presence of such injuries complicates the attribution of death solely to SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying that the cause of death might be SIDS or another natural or accidental cause), the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other reasons is low, as these are not characteristic of SIDS and suggest some form of trauma.

**Probability judgment: 5**
To determine the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's analyze the given information:

1. **The findings on Andy**: Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs. These are indicative of potential non-accidental injury.

2. **The context of Andy's death**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes. However, upon re-examination following the suspicious death of his brother Ben, signs of potential abuse were identified.

3. **Alternative explanation - SIDS**: The deaths could be attributed to SIDS, which is a sudden and unexplained death in infants. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

If Jane is not guilty, then the implication is that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse by Jane.

The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy could be interpreted in a few ways if Jane is not guilty:
- These injuries could be accidental or related to another condition or circumstance not related to Jane's actions.
- Alternatively, the interpretation of these findings as indicative of smothering or abuse could be disputed or considered not conclusive.

However, if we are assuming Jane is not guilty, we must consider that these findings might have been misinterpreted or not directly related to the cause of death. 

SIDS does not typically present with these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung), as it is characterized by a lack of explanatory cause for death after thorough investigation.

To quantify the likelihood of these findings in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of such injuries occurring in a context that is not related to Jane's actions (e.g., accidental injury, other natural causes, or misinterpretation of the autopsy findings).

The injuries described are not typical for SIDS. Research and medical literature often discuss the challenges of differentiating between SIDS and infant homicides. The presence of certain injuries like a torn frenulum can be highly suggestive of non-accidental injury.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, we need to assess the likelihood of these specific autopsy findings occurring coincidentally or due to an alternative explanation.

The probability judgment that these findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are present in Andy if Jane is not guilty involves considering the likelihood of these being either misinterpreted or due to other causes.

Given that these findings are not typical for SIDS and are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury, if Jane is not guilty and therefore not responsible for the injuries, the likelihood that these findings are present coincidentally or due to an alternative, non-abuse related explanation is relatively low.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination of his autopsy.
The re-examination of Andy's autopsy revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are being considered as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation given for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. It is more common among boys than girls.

## Step 3: Analyze the likelihood of the observed injuries in Andy if Jane is not guilty, implying that Andy's death could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.
If Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death is not due to smothering or any form of abuse. The injuries found (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are typically associated with non-accidental injury.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of the observed injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or natural causes.
The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury. SIDS, by definition, is unexplained and not typically associated with such injuries.

## Step 5: Determine the likelihood of these injuries if Andy's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause.
Given that SIDS is not typically associated with significant external or internal injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, or blood in the lung, the presence of these injuries would be unusual in a case of SIDS.

## Step 6: Quantify the likelihood based on the information provided and the understanding of SIDS and non-accidental injuries.
Since the injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse), these findings would be unexpected.

## Step 7: Consider the probability of such injuries occurring naturally or being misinterpreted.
While it's possible for infants to have accidental injuries, the specific combination and nature of the injuries described are often associated with non-accidental trauma.

## Step 8: Evaluate the overall probability.
The injuries are unlikely if Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause, as they suggest non-accidental injury.

## Step 9: Assign a probability judgment based on the analysis.
Given that the described injuries are not typical for SIDS and are more commonly associated with abuse, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present due to other reasons (not abuse) is low.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI) or abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is often associated with a blow to the mouth. Blood in the lung can be indicative of trauma or other forms of injury.

2. **Alternative Explanations and SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the death of both Andy and Ben could be SIDS. However, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical characteristics of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is unexplained after a thorough investigation, including an autopsy.

3. **Relevance of Findings to SIDS vs. Smothering**: The findings in Andy's re-examination are more suggestive of trauma than SIDS. If Andy's death was due to SIDS, it would be unusual to find such significant signs of trauma.

4. **Assessing Probability**: The question revolves around the probability of these traumatic findings if Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these traumatic injuries would be unexpected because they are not characteristic of SIDS.

However, it's also possible that the initial autopsy missed these details or they were not considered significant at the time, or there was another, unrelated reason for these injuries.

5. **Likelihood of Traumatic Injuries in SIDS**: Research and forensic pathology indicate that infants who die of SIDS typically do not have significant external or internal injuries. Thus, if Andy died of SIDS, the likelihood of having these specific traumatic findings is low.

Considering these points, if Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the presence of significant traumatic injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) would be unusual.

Probability judgment: 5
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the implications of the medical evidence.

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen that was significant enough to cause brain damage.

2. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a medical interpretation based on the autopsy findings. If Jane is not guilty, the cause of Ben's death and the timing of the hypoxic damage need to be considered in the context of alternative explanations, such as SIDS or other natural causes.

3. **Assessing Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to smothering or any other form of abuse inflicted by Jane. In such a case, the hypoxic damage would need to be explained by other means. 

4. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways, but SIDS itself does not typically involve significant hypoxic damage that is diagnosable as occurring hours before death. Significant hypoxic damage typically implies a pathological process or event.

5. **Likelihood**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and interpretation of the autopsy findings. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that this damage occurred as stated depends on whether there is an alternative explanation for both the damage and Ben's death that is consistent with the lack of guilt.

However, the statement about the timing is a medical interpretation that is not directly dependent on Jane's guilt or innocence regarding the act of smothering. The critical factor is whether the medical evidence supports the timing of the hypoxic damage.

Given the medical evidence, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is not directly influenced by Jane's guilt or innocence. The medical evidence stands on its own.

Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on the validity and interpretation of the medical evidence rather than Jane's guilt or innocence.

Probability judgment: 50
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a significant and potentially violent or traumatic event.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for Ben's death and the associated injuries is needed. SIDS is one such alternative, but it typically does not involve significant injuries or hypoxic damage that is diagnosable.

3. **SIDS and the Findings**: The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when no other cause of death can be found after thorough investigation.

4. **Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) would be unusual because they suggest a more complex or traumatic cause of death.

5. **Assessing Probability**: Given that the findings are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that there must be another explanation for these findings that is not related to her actions.

The likelihood of observing these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) in the context of SIDS or another natural cause of death is low. These findings typically point towards a non-natural or traumatic cause.

Probability judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the implications of these similarities.

1. **Understanding the Similarities**: The similarities include the age of the babies at death, the time of day they died after being fed, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious. These similarities could be coincidental or indicative of a pattern.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or other natural causes. SIDS is known for its unpredictability and lack of clear causes.

3. **SIDS and Similarities**: While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and can occur at any time, certain risk factors and characteristics (like age and time of death) can sometimes show patterns or similarities in cases. However, SIDS deaths are generally considered to be random and unpredictable.

4. **Assessing Likelihood of Similarities**: The likelihood that two SIDS deaths (or deaths due to other natural causes) would share several specific characteristics (age, time of day relative to feeding, and being found by Jane while she was alone with them) is not straightforward. Some of these factors (like age) could be related to the typical age range for SIDS, but others (like the time of day and being found by Jane) might be more coincidental.

5. **Coincidence and Probability**: The probability that two independent events (like two SIDS deaths) would share multiple specific characteristics can be low, depending on the number and specificity of those characteristics.

Given the multiple similarities and assuming they are not directly related to Jane's actions (since we are considering the scenario where Jane is not guilty), the probability of these similarities occurring by chance is relatively low. This is because the combination of several specific factors (age at death, time of day, and circumstances of discovery) happening in both cases is not very likely if the deaths are unrelated and natural.

## Step 1: Understand the given scenario and the condition that Jane is NOT GUILTY.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse by Jane. Given this context, we need to consider alternative explanations for the findings in Andy's autopsy.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the deaths - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The given risk factors and frequency (1 in 4,000 in the UK) are relevant. However, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are typically associated with trauma or abuse, not SIDS.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in the context of SIDS or accidental death.
The injuries described are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI) rather than SIDS. SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanatory cause for death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, and internal bleeding is not typical for SIDS.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of these findings occurring if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it means the injuries were either accidental or misinterpreted. While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental injuries, the specific combination of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma. However, the question is about the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, implying we are considering alternative scenarios where these might occur naturally or accidentally.

## Step 5: Consider the likelihood of such injuries occurring accidentally.
Some of these injuries can occur accidentally, but the combination and severity are critical factors. A torn frenulum can occur accidentally in infants, for example, during a fall. Bruises can also occur accidentally. However, the presence of blood in the lung is a more serious injury that is less likely to be accidental.

## Step 6: Reflect on the overall probability given the condition that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking for the probability that these injuries occurred without her causing them. The injuries found are serious and typically associated with non-accidental injury. However, the task is to evaluate the likelihood under the assumption of innocence.

## Step 7: Determine the probability.
The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the observed injuries must have another explanation. While SIDS does not typically involve such injuries, and they are more aligned with abuse, there's a need to consider the possibility of accidental or alternative explanations. However, the specific injuries mentioned are generally considered to be indicative of abuse.

## Step 8: Assign a probability judgment based on the information.
Given the condition that Jane is not guilty, and considering the nature of the injuries, we must assess how likely it is for these injuries to occur without Jane's guilt. The injuries are indicative of non-accidental trauma, making it less likely they occurred accidentally or were unrelated to Jane's actions if she is assumed not guilty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane's innocence implies that the deaths were not due to her actions.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not related to smothering or abuse, such as accidental injury. However, in the context of an 11-week-old infant who was found dead and initially attributed to natural causes or SIDS, the presence of bruises might be considered unusual but not entirely impossible due to accidental injury or handling. The key issue is whether these are more likely due to abuse or other causes.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly in infants who cannot move around or inflict such injuries on themselves. It is considered a significant indicator of potential abuse.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of several conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental injury (such as suffocation or smothering), or other medical conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering an alternative explanation like SIDS for both deaths, we must assess whether the findings could be consistent with SIDS or other non-abusive causes.

SIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically not associated with significant pathological findings that would explain death, although minor changes can sometimes be present.

The re-examination findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) suggest that Andy's death might not have been a straightforward case of SIDS or natural causes. If Jane is not guilty, these findings need an alternative explanation. 

However, if we are to consider the probability of these specific findings occurring in Andy if Jane is not guilty (implying that the cause of death and injuries might be unrelated to her actions), we are essentially evaluating how plausible it is that these signs could be present without being related to smothering or abuse by Jane.

The injuries found are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other potential perpetrators or alternative explanations. However, the scenario doesn't directly support an alternative perpetrator or cause for these specific injuries.

Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes or being misinterpreted is relatively low because they are typically associated with non-accidental injury.

The probability judgment: 5
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This indicates that the brain suffered from a lack of oxygen. While it could be due to smothering, it could also result from other causes such as a severe respiratory infection, a congenital condition, or an accident that led to asphyxiation.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are often associated with significant trauma or increased pressure within the chest or head, which could result from various causes, including non-accidental injury or, less commonly, accidental injury or a medical condition.

If Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages need to be explained by other causes. While SIDS is a possible explanation for Ben's death, the presence of specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages makes it less likely to be a straightforward SIDS case, as SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings.

Other potential causes could include accidental or non-accidental injury. However, the scenario does not directly provide an alternative perpetrator or a clear accidental cause.

The presence of these findings is generally considered indicative of a possible non-accidental cause. If Jane is not guilty, one has to consider other potential explanations or perpetrators. However, without additional context, the likelihood of these findings occurring without any foul play by Jane or another individual is relatively low.

The probability judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, we are considering alternative scenarios for Ben's death and the timing of the hypoxic damage to his brain. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and interpretation of the autopsy findings.

The timing of hypoxic damage can be difficult to determine precisely and depends on various factors, including the severity of the hypoxia and the individual's response to it. However, medical professionals can make educated estimates based on the condition of the tissues and other pathological findings.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the medical assessment is accurate, the hypoxic damage still having occurred a matter of hours before death doesn't directly implicate or exonerate Jane based on timing alone. The critical question remains whether Jane could have been responsible for the actions leading to the hypoxic damage.

However, the question is not directly asking for Jane's guilt or innocence based on this timing but rather the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death if she is not guilty.

The doctor's statement implies a medical basis for the timing. If we accept the medical assessment as accurate, then the likelihood of the hypoxic damage having occurred a matter of hours before death is not directly influenced by Jane's guilt or innocence. Instead, it is a matter of the medical evidence's interpretation.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and the medical assessment is to be believed, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death remains tied to the accuracy of the medical assessment rather than Jane's guilt.

The probability judgment: 80
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these coincidences occurring naturally.

1. **Both babies were about the same age when they died**: SIDS and infant deaths can occur at any age within the first year, but there's a peak incidence around 2-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died at around 2-3 months, which, while not extremely common, is within the range of typical ages for SIDS or other infant deaths. This similarity could be coincidental given the relatively narrow age range for heightened vulnerability.

2. **They both died at a similar time of day after just being fed**: Infant deaths can occur at any time. The fact that both occurred after feeding might be coincidental, as feeding is a regular activity for infants. The timing could be related to the natural rhythms of infant care and the vulnerabilities associated with certain times of the day or activities.

3. **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them**: This is perhaps the most striking similarity. However, it's also a circumstance that could arise due to Jane being the primary caregiver and thus being the one to discover the infants unresponsive.

If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities depends on how probable it is for these events to occur coincidentally. SIDS deaths or unexplained infant deaths share some common characteristics due to the age and vulnerability of the infants. However, the specific combination of these similarities (age, timing relative to feeding, and being found by Jane) is less common.

The probability of all these specific similarities occurring by chance is relatively low because it involves a combination of factors. However, assessing the exact probability is challenging without a large dataset of SIDS or infant death cases for comparison.

Given the uniqueness of the combination of these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring naturally is relatively low.

The probability judgment: 20

To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of the deaths.

First, let's analyze the given information:
1. Both babies died at a similar age (11 weeks and 8 weeks).
2. They died at a similar time of day after being fed.
3. Jane found both babies unconscious when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, the most plausible alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is known for being sudden and unexplained, and its occurrence is not directly linked to the actions of the caregiver, in this case, Jane.

Let's examine the similarities in the context of SIDS or other non-criminal causes:

1. **Age**: SIDS typically occurs within the first year of life, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Both deaths occurring within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks) is plausible for SIDS.

2. **Time of Day and After Feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time. However, the fact that both babies died after being fed and at a similar time of day could be coincidental, especially if we consider that infants sleep a lot during the day and night, and feeding is a regular activity that occurs multiple times a day.

3. **Found Unconscious by Jane**: If Jane was the primary caregiver, it is reasonable that she was alone with the babies when they died, as she would be the one checking on them.

The key question is whether these similarities are likely under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (i.e., the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause).

The similarities in age and circumstance (being found by Jane after being fed) could be seen as coincidental given that both were infants and under similar care. However, the specific timing and circumstances might be considered less likely to repeat by coincidence.

To quantify this, we need to understand that SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000). The probability of two consecutive SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely low because it's a rare event. However, the question isn't directly asking for the probability of two SIDS deaths but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities if Jane is not guilty.

The probability that both infants died of SIDS and that the observed similarities occur is influenced by various factors, including the base rate of SIDS, the practices of the caregiver (e.g., feeding, sleeping arrangements), and random chance.

While the specific probability is difficult to calculate directly from the given information, we can infer that the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family, although extremely rare, does happen. The additional factor of similarities in the circumstances (time of day, after feeding) adds complexity.

Research and statistical analysis on SIDS have shown that while the probability of a second SIDS death in a family is higher than the first (due in part to shared genetic and environmental factors), it is still very low.

Given these considerations and without precise statistical models or more detailed data on the distribution of times and circumstances of SIDS deaths, we can qualitatively assess that the likelihood of these similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is low but not impossible.

To provide a probability judgment as requested, we must simplify our assessment. The exact probability calculation for such a specific scenario isn't directly available from the information given.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of the deaths. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural causes or accidents, with SIDS being one of the possibilities mentioned.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS typically occurs within the first year, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Thus, the ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths are within the range where SIDS could be considered a possible explanation.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is not directly linked to feeding, though some research has explored potential associations between SIDS and factors like the position of the infant after feeding. The fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious could be coincidental, given that she was their primary caregiver.

3. **Similarities and Coincidence**: If both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the similarities in circumstances (age, time of day relative to feeding, and being found by Jane) could be due to coincidence or shared environmental and caregiving factors.

To estimate the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring by chance. 

- The probability of a baby dying from SIDS is 1 in 4,000.
- The age factor: Both dying between 2-3 months is relatively specific but still within the plausible range for SIDS.
- The circumstance of being found by Jane after feeding could be seen as somewhat coincidental but is also influenced by the fact that she was the primary caregiver and would likely be the one to check on the babies.

However, calculating an exact probability is challenging without specific data on the distribution of SIDS deaths by age, time of day, and other factors. Nonetheless, the key is understanding that if Jane is innocent, the similarities could be attributed to a combination of coincidence and the natural circumstances of infant care.

The crucial point is that SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained and might share some common factors or circumstances due to the typical age and vulnerability of the infants.

**Probability Judgment: 60**

This judgment reflects a considered likelihood that, given Jane's innocence and assuming both deaths were due to natural causes like SIDS, there could still be similarities in the circumstances surrounding the deaths due to a mix of coincidence, the natural caregiving context, and the vulnerabilities of infants at similar ages. It does not imply a high certainty but acknowledges that such similarities could occur. 

**60**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of death that are not related to Jane's actions, such as SIDS.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS typically occurs within the first year of life, with a peak incidence around 2-4 months. The ages of Andy and Ben are within this range, making it plausible for both deaths to be SIDS if they were not related to Jane's actions.

2. **Time of Day and Feeding**: Both babies died after being fed and at a similar time of day. While the exact timing and circumstances (e.g., being fed) might not be directly related to SIDS, it's known that SIDS can occur at any time, and there's no established direct correlation between feeding and SIDS, though there are some discussions about the potential protective effects of breastfeeding.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: Both times, Jane was alone with the babies when they were found unconscious. This is a circumstance that could occur by chance, given that she was their primary caregiver.

To assess the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), we must consider how likely it is for two SIDS deaths to share these characteristics.

1. **SIDS Frequency and Demographics**: SIDS is more common among boys, and its frequency is about 1 in 4,000. The fact that both Andy and Ben were boys slightly increases the likelihood that both deaths could be SIDS, given the demographic.

2. **Coincidence of Circumstances**: The specific circumstances (age, time of day, after feeding) could occur by chance. However, the probability that both deaths occur under very similar circumstances (like being found by the same person, around the same age) by coincidence is relatively low but not impossible.

The probability that two SIDS deaths occur in the same family is extremely low, given the already low frequency of SIDS (1 in 4,000). However, the question is not directly asking for the probability of two SIDS deaths but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities if Jane is not guilty.

If we consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the observed similarities (age, circumstances) could be seen as coincidental or related to shared risk factors or environmental conditions.

The probability that two infants in the same family die of SIDS is a topic of much lower incidence and has been the subject of some statistical analysis in medical literature. It is recognized that having one SIDS death in a family does not significantly increase the likelihood of another, as SIDS is considered to be a multifactorial condition without a clear genetic link.

However, quantifying the exact probability of these specific similarities occurring under the condition that Jane is not guilty involves complex considerations of conditional probabilities and is heavily dependent on the underlying assumptions about the causes of death.

**Given the complexity and the lack of specific probabilities for each of the observed similarities under the condition of Jane's innocence, a precise numerical calculation is challenging.**

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential causes of the deaths. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions, such as SIDS.

First, let's analyze the given information and the similarities:

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS typically occurs within the first year, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. Thus, the ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths are within the range where SIDS could be considered a possible explanation.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is not directly linked to feeding. However, the fact that both were found by Jane when she was alone could be circumstantial.

The key similarities (age, time of day, and being found by Jane) could be coincidental or related to the natural circumstances of infant deaths. 

If we consider SIDS as a possible cause, the probability of two consecutive siblings dying from SIDS is very low because SIDS is rare (1 in 4,000). However, the probability of certain circumstances being similar (e.g., age, being found by the same person) could be evaluated based on general infant death statistics and the specifics of the situation.

The probability that two infants in the same family die of SIDS is higher than the squared probability of a single SIDS death due to potential shared risk factors (genetic, environmental). Research indicates that the risk of a second SIDS death in the same family is significantly higher than in the general population, though still low.

The likelihood of the specific similarities (e.g., age, time of day, being found by Jane) occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty involves considering both the base rate of SIDS and the distribution of circumstances around infant deaths.

While the exact probability calculation is complex due to the need for detailed statistical data on the distribution of ages, times, and circumstances of SIDS and other infant deaths, we can consider that the circumstances around both deaths being similar could occur by chance, especially if the deaths are due to a similar cause like SIDS.

Given the rare occurrence of SIDS and the specificity of the similarities, we still need to assess the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance.

The probability judgment is: 20 

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential explanations for these similarities.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies died at approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is known to occur most frequently between 1-4 months of age. Thus, it's plausible that both deaths occurring within this age range could happen by chance, given that SIDS is a phenomenon that occurs within this age bracket.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both babies died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is known for its unpredictability. The fact that both were found by Jane after being alone with them could simply be a result of the fact that she was their primary caregiver.

3. **Similarities Due to Shared Environment and Care**: As siblings, both babies were likely cared for in similar ways by their parents, including feeding practices. The similarity in the time of day they were found could be related to their feeding schedules and sleep patterns, which are often similar for infants.

Given that Jane is not guilty and assuming both deaths were due to SIDS (or another natural cause), the similarities can be attributed to:
- The natural history and risk period of SIDS.
- The caregiving practices and environment shared by both infants.
- The fact that Jane, as the primary caregiver, was likely to be the one to discover them.

The probability of both infants dying from SIDS is independent of Jane's actions if she is not guilty. The probability that both died of SIDS is low due to its inherent low frequency (1 in 4,000). However, the question is not asking for the probability of both dying from SIDS but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities between the two incidents under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the observed similarities (age, time of day, found by Jane) could occur due to the shared circumstances and caregiving environment.

To quantify the likelihood of these specific similarities occurring by chance under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is complex due to the lack of clear data on the distribution of times of SIDS events, the age distribution within the SIDS risk period, and other factors.

However, intuitively, given that both babies were at a susceptible age for SIDS, were cared for by the same primary caregiver, and had similar routines (e.g., feeding times), it's not implausible that their deaths, if due to SIDS or a similar cause, could share some similarities.

The probability judgment of there being these similarities if Jane is not guilty would be higher than if we were calculating the probability of two SIDS events occurring in the same family, because we are conditioning on the fact that both deaths occurred.

Considering these factors, a reasonable, though still speculative, probability judgment reflecting the likelihood of observing these similarities under the condition that Jane is not guilty could be considered relatively plausible due to the shared caregiving context and the characteristics of SIDS.

**70**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the underlying causes of the deaths.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies died at approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS typically occurs within the first year, with a peak incidence around 2-4 months. Thus, both deaths occurring within a couple of months of age is within the realm of the age distribution for SIDS, although the exact ages are somewhat different.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is known for its unpredictability. The fact that both incidents happened after feeding and when Jane was alone with them could be coincidental, given that infants spend a significant amount of time with their caregivers, especially mothers, during the early weeks of life.

3. **Similarity in Circumstances under SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty and both deaths were due to SIDS, the similarity in the circumstances (e.g., age, time relative to feeding, being found by Jane) isn't necessarily highly improbable because SIDS deaths are often unwitnessed and occur under varying circumstances. However, the key here is whether the specific constellation of similarities (age, timing relative to feeding, etc.) is likely under SIDS.

Let's break it down further:

- The probability that both die of SIDS is low to start with because SIDS is rare (1 in 4,000).
- The probability that both occur at a similar age is somewhat plausible because both were within the first few months, a period when SIDS is more likely.
- The fact that Jane found both could be due to her being the primary caregiver.

However, calculating the exact probability of these specific similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty (and thus, both deaths are SIDS) involves complex considerations of conditional probabilities and the base rate of SIDS.

The critical point is that while each SIDS death is tragic and unexpected, the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare, much rarer than the simple probability of 1 in 4,000 squared because there's a familial component to SIDS risk. However, the exact probability of the similarities in the circumstances described isn't straightforward to calculate without making several assumptions.

Research has shown that the risk of a second SIDS death in the same family is higher than the general population risk but still very low.

Given these complexities, a precise numerical probability judgment requires a nuanced understanding of SIDS epidemiology and the specific circumstances of these deaths. However, we can simplify by considering that the probability of two SIDS deaths happening with the described similarities involves multiplying the low probability of SIDS with considerations for the specific similarities observed.

Probability Judgment: 5
The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's autopsy are significant findings. These injuries are often associated with non-accidental trauma, and in the context of an infant's death, they can be indicative of abuse or violent actions leading to death.

If Jane is not guilty, then the expectation would be that Andy's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS. The injuries described are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries such as those described would not be expected in a SIDS death.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These are indicative of trauma and are not characteristic of SIDS deaths.
2. **Torn frenulum**: This is a specific injury often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, which is not typical in SIDS.
3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of significant stress or trauma to the infant.

The presence of these findings in Andy's autopsy suggests that his death may not have been due to natural causes like SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy is low because they are indicative of trauma rather than a natural death.

Probability Judgment: 1
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions, and potentially, it could have been due to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the autopsy findings, including hypoxic damage to the brain, hypoxic damage to the eyes and eyelids (indicated by haemorrhages), and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, are not typical for SIDS.

Hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) occurring a matter of hours before death suggests a process or event that led to prolonged hypoxia before death. SIDS is characterized by a sudden and unexpected death, typically without a clear cause or significant findings on autopsy that would indicate a prolonged process leading to death.

The presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is more indicative of a pathological process or event rather than SIDS, which is generally not associated with such clear evidence of a prolonged hypoxic episode before death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is low, because SIDS is not typically associated with such a clear indication of prolonged hypoxia.

However, it's also possible that if Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane but another cause, the hypoxic damage could have been due to another reason. Still, the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage as described do not fit well with the typical profile of SIDS.

Probability Judgment: 20
The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a significant lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and are considered consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Ben's death was not due to her actions, and potentially, it could have been due to SIDS or another cause.

However, the specific autopsy findings mentioned (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is typically diagnosed when the death remains unexplained after thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of these specific findings suggests that Ben's death may have been due to a cause other than SIDS, potentially a natural cause or an accident, but more likely, given the description, a non-natural or traumatic cause.

If Ben's death was not due to Jane's actions (and thus not smothering or other violent trauma by her), the likelihood of these specific findings being present still needs to be considered in the context of other possible causes.

The described findings are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of death in infants. They are more indicative of a significant hypoxic event or trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) is relatively low because they are not characteristic of the typical natural or SIDS deaths.

To address the question, let's analyze the given information step by step, assuming Jane is not guilty.

1. **Understanding the Condition of Ben**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and physical stress or trauma.

2. **Considering the Hypothesis of Smothering**: The prosecution suggests that Jane smothered both babies. The autopsy findings for Ben are consistent with smothering or other forms of violent trauma, as they indicate hypoxia.

3. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense could argue that both deaths were due to SIDS, a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly without a clear cause.

4. **Analyzing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother the babies. Therefore, we are considering the likelihood of the observed autopsy findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) under the assumption that the deaths were not due to smothering by Jane.

5. **SIDS and Autopsy Findings**: SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. While the exact mechanism of SIDS is not known, it is typically characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings that would explain the death. The presence of significant autopsy findings such as hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben's case is not typical for SIDS.

6. **Assessing the Probability**: If Jane is not guilty and did not smother Ben, the observed autopsy findings could still be due to other causes or conditions not related to Jane's actions. However, these findings are not characteristic of SIDS. Other possible explanations might include accidental or unexplained medical conditions that could result in similar findings.

7. **Evaluating the Likelihood of the Findings**: The specific autopsy findings for Ben are unusual for SIDS. While it's not impossible for an infant to have such findings and still be considered a SIDS death if other criteria are met, these findings more typically suggest some form of trauma or asphyxia.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were not due to her actions, one would need to consider alternative explanations for Ben's autopsy findings. The presence of significant injuries is not typical for SIDS, suggesting that if Jane is innocent, there might be other explanations for the findings that are not related to her guilt.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the specific autopsy findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) would occur in the context of SIDS or another natural cause, given that these findings are more indicative of trauma or asphyxia. However, it's not a zero probability since there could be rare or complex medical explanations for these findings that are not related to Jane's guilt.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's analyze the given information and the condition of Ben. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or stress on the body, which could be due to various causes, not solely smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death might not be due to smothering or any form of violence inflicted by her. There are a few possibilities to consider:

1. **SIDS or Natural Causes:** The question mentions SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of explanation after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some SIDS cases may show some signs of stress or minor pathological changes, significant hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally without a clear cause, and significant pathological findings like those in Ben's case are unusual.

2. **Other Medical Conditions:** There could be other medical conditions or accidental causes that led to Ben's death, potentially explaining the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages. For example, an accidental asphyxiation or an undiagnosed medical condition could potentially cause similar findings.

3. **Misinterpretation of Autopsy Results:** There's a possibility, though it should be based on expert testimony, that the findings could be misinterpreted or not directly linked to smothering.

To evaluate the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how plausible it is for these autopsy results to occur without smothering or violence. The presence of significant hypoxic damage and hemorrhages suggests a severe event or condition leading to these outcomes.

While it's possible that there could be other explanations for these findings, the specific combination and severity of the injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are more typically associated with a traumatic or violent cause, such as smothering, rather than SIDS or most natural causes.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate, we are left to consider less common or alternative explanations that could result in similar pathological findings.

Given the specifics of Ben's autopsy and assuming Jane's innocence (implying no smothering or intentional act by her), the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low because these are not typical for SIDS or most accidental or natural causes.

Probability Judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and whether they could naturally occur or be coincidental.

The similarities mentioned include:
1. **Age at death:** Both babies were approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks).
2. **Time of day and recent feeding:** Both died at a similar time of day, shortly after being fed.
3. **Discovery by Jane while alone:** Jane found both babies unconscious when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural or accidental causes. Let's consider the likelihood of these similarities under such circumstances.

1. **Age:** SIDS or other natural/accidental causes can occur at any age within the first year, but there's a peak incidence around 2-4 months. The ages of 11 weeks and 8 weeks are relatively close and within a plausible range for SIDS or other causes, so this similarity isn't extremely unusual.

2. **Time of day and recent feeding:** SIDS can occur at any time. However, it's known that SIDS deaths can be more common during certain periods, such as after feeding or during sleep periods, due to various factors like the infant's position or potential issues related to the feeding and sleeping environment. The fact that both incidents happened after feeding and at a similar time could be seen as a coincidence or related to the typical daily routine of infants.

3. **Discovery by Jane while alone:** This aspect is more related to the circumstances of care rather than the cause of death. Given that Jane was the primary caregiver (as implied), it is plausible that she would be alone with both children at some point, especially during feeding and around the times they were put to bed or checked on.

The key here is that if the deaths were due to SIDS or other unrelated natural causes, some of the observed similarities (like age and time of day) might still occur by chance due to the routine nature of infant care and the typical age range for such events.

However, the combination of these specific similarities (same caregiver, similar age, similar time of day, and both being found after being fed) might be considered less likely to occur by pure coincidence, given that SIDS and other causes are generally considered to be unrelated and random events.

The probability that these similarities occur by chance, assuming Jane's innocence and unrelated causes of death, is not extremely high but is still plausible due to the routine nature of infant care.

Probability Judgment: 30
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The initial autopsy suggested natural causes of death for Andy. However, upon re-examination, the findings indicated potential signs of abuse or trauma, such as bruises, a torn frenulum (which can be indicative of a blow to the mouth), and blood in the lung.

If Jane is not guilty, these findings must be explained by other means. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Misinterpretation or Over-interpretation of Autopsy Findings:** There's a possibility that the findings could be misinterpreted. However, bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered to be significant indicators of trauma.

2. **Accidental Injury:** Some of these findings, like bruises to the arms and legs, could potentially be explained by accidental injuries. However, a torn frenulum and blood in the lung are more typically associated with significant trauma or abuse.

3. **Other Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions or natural diseases could potentially cause some of these findings, but it's less likely for all of them to be explained by a single condition or accident.

The presence of multiple indicators of trauma (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) makes it less likely that these are all coincidental or due to natural causes or a single accidental event, especially if they are not clearly explained by other factors.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming that the autopsy findings are accurate and not due to misinterpretation, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes or accidents is relatively low.

Probability Judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the implications of the doctor's statement and the context.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death suggests that the cause of the damage was a relatively recent event before Ben's death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the hypoxic damage was not due to her actions (e.g., smothering).

Hypoxic damage (lack of oxygen to the brain) can occur due to various reasons, including medical conditions, accidents, or other forms of asphyxia not necessarily related to smothering by Jane.

The key point here is whether the timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is plausible without Jane being guilty. If Ben suffered from a condition or an event that caused hypoxia a few hours before death, it's possible that Jane, as a caregiver, might not have been responsible for it.

However, the doctor's statement restricts the timing to "a matter of hours before death," which implies that the event causing hypoxia occurred when Ben was likely under Jane's care, given that she was the one who found him unconscious.

The likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death without Jane being guilty hinges on whether there could have been another cause or event that led to the hypoxia during that timeframe.

If we consider that Jane was with Ben and found him, the fact that the damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" could still be coincidental with Jane's presence and not necessarily directly caused by her actions. However, this timing does raise suspicions and makes it less likely to be a mere coincidence if there are no other plausible explanations.

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not related to smothering or abuse, such as accidents or certain medical conditions. However, in the context of a post-mortem examination and given the other findings, it's crucial to consider how likely these are to be coincidental or due to other factors.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This can be indicative of trauma to the mouth, which could be due to abuse but also could occur accidentally. The presence of a torn frenulum in a baby who died from SIDS or another cause is not typical unless there was an accidental injury.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental injury, or even resuscitation attempts.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are examining the scenario where the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically does not present with the described injuries, the re-examination findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are often associated with non-accidental injury in the context of infant deaths.

However, it's also possible that some of these findings could be misinterpreted, or there could be alternative explanations. For instance, medical procedures or attempts at resuscitation might cause certain injuries.

The key question here is how likely are these findings if Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause and not due to smothering or abuse by Jane. 

SIDS is unpredictable and not fully understood, and while certain autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung complicates the picture. These findings are generally not characteristic of SIDS.

To assign a probability, we need to consider how often such findings occur in infants who have died of SIDS or other natural causes. In general, significant traumatic injuries like a torn frenulum are not expected in SIDS.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be SIDS or another natural cause), the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present due to other reasons or misinterpretation is low because they are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these specific injuries is relatively unlikely.

Probability judgment: 20
To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the implications of Jane's innocence on the timing and cause of the hypoxic damage.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering or other forms of abuse by Jane. Hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) can occur due to various reasons, including but not limited to smothering.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates that at some point before death, Ben experienced a period of insufficient oxygen. The timing of this event relative to death is crucial.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the hypoxic damage could still have occurred but its timing and cause would be unrelated to Jane's actions. However, in cases of SIDS, the death is typically sudden and unexpected, and while there may be some underlying vulnerability or risk factor, the exact mechanism leading to death is not fully understood.

The doctor's testimony that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a significant event or period of hypoxia occurring relatively close to the time of death. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of this statement being true depends on whether the natural cause of death or the circumstances surrounding it could have led to hypoxic damage in the hours preceding death.

For SIDS or some natural causes, it's conceivable that there was a process or condition leading to death that could have caused hypoxic damage in the hours before. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours) is critical, and the cause of such damage would need to be consistent with the circumstances of Ben's death.

Given that we're considering Jane's innocence, if the hypoxic damage was part of the process leading to a natural death (like SIDS), the assertion that it occurred "a matter of hours before death" may not be directly related to Jane's actions but rather to the underlying cause of death.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is plausible because it could be part of the natural progression towards death, rather than being directly caused by Jane's actions.

Probability judgment: 50
If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids need to be explained by other causes. While these findings are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, they could potentially be attributed to other rare medical conditions or circumstances.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This can result from various causes that lead to a lack of oxygen to the brain, not just smothering or violent trauma. Severe infections, cardiac issues, or other medical conditions could potentially lead to hypoxic damage.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These can occur due to various reasons including but not limited to trauma. Certain medical conditions or resuscitation attempts could potentially cause such hemorrhages.

If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings is lower because they are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury. However, it is still possible that they could be due to rare or unusual natural causes.

The key issue here is that the described findings are typically associated with a significant and potentially traumatic event. If Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider alternative explanations for these findings, which might be less likely given the specific nature of the injuries.

Given that the findings are indicative of a potentially traumatic or violent cause, and assuming Jane's innocence (implying no violent trauma by her), the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes is relatively low.

Probability judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents is a matter of evaluating the probability of coincidence or natural circumstances leading to these similarities.

1. **Age at death**: Both babies being around the same age when they died could be a coincidence, given that the age range for SIDS is generally within the first year of life, with a peak around 2-4 months. The fact that both were approximately the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) could be seen as a coincidence, although it is within a plausible range for SIDS.

2. **Time of day and after feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time, and there isn't a strong established correlation with the time of day or feeding. However, it's known that SIDS can occur after feeding or during sleep. The similarity in the time of day and the circumstance (after feeding) might be seen as less likely to be a coincidence, but it's still within the realm of possibility, especially if both babies were generally healthy and the circumstances around their deaths were otherwise typical for SIDS.

3. **Found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them**: This aspect, while potentially suspicious in the context of Jane's guilt, is also a circumstance that could occur naturally if both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause. SIDS is characterized by the infant being found dead or unresponsive, often without warning.

The combination of these factors (age, time of day, circumstance of being found) being similar for both incidents is striking. However, if we consider that both deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the probability of some similarities existing by chance is not negligible.

The probability that these similarities occur by chance (given Jane's innocence and assuming the deaths were due to natural causes like SIDS) is difficult to quantify precisely. However, given that these are relatively specific circumstances, while not impossible, they are somewhat unlikely to occur by coincidence.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. The key information provided is that Jane is not guilty, implying that the deaths might not be due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in infants can be indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative explanations for the findings**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider other potential causes for Ben's condition. SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) suggests that Ben's death may not be simply categorized as SIDS, as SIDS does not typically present with such clear signs of trauma or asphyxia.

3. **Assessing the likelihood**: The presence of hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages is more commonly associated with asphyxial events or trauma rather than SIDS. If Jane is not guilty, then for these findings to be consistent with her innocence, there would need to be another explanation for these injuries that does not involve her directly causing them.

Given the information and the fact that these specific injuries are not typical of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that these findings would occur due to natural or accidental causes unrelated to her actions. However, it's also possible that there could be other, less direct explanations or mitigating circumstances.

Therefore, considering the direct implication of the injuries and the information given, the likelihood that these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are consistent with Jane not being guilty is relatively low because they strongly suggest some form of asphyxial event or trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children.

The findings on Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. While these can be consistent with smothering, they are not exclusive to smothering. Other causes could potentially lead to similar findings, such as accidental suffocation or other forms of asphyxia not related to smothering by Jane.

However, given the context that the prosecution is suggesting these findings are due to smothering by Jane, if Jane is not guilty, we have to consider whether these findings could occur through other means or if they could be artefactual or misinterpreted.

1. **Alternative Causes**: There could be medical conditions or accidents that result in similar pathological findings. However, the specific combination of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is quite specific and typically raises suspicion of asphyxial mechanisms.

2. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: The provided information on SIDS indicates it is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly cause the specific injuries described for Ben. SIDS is more about the absence of a clear cause of death rather than a cause itself.

3. **Misinterpretation or Artefact**: The injuries described could be due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, though the specific pattern described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is generally considered to be associated with an asphyxial event.

If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present, there would need to be an alternative explanation that is equally or more plausible than smothering. Given the specifics of the case and the nature of the injuries, if we are to assume Jane did not smother Ben, we are left with a scenario where either there was an alternative cause for the asphyxial signs or the interpretation of the findings is incorrect.

Given the information and focusing on the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages could occur if Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering), we need to consider the plausibility of alternative explanations for these specific findings.

The specific injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages) are strongly suggestive of an asphyxial event. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to propose a plausible alternative asphyxial mechanism or condition that could lead to these findings.

The probability judgment should reflect how likely it is for these findings to occur under the condition that Jane is not guilty. 

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the implications of the timing of the hypoxic damage in the context of Jane's guilt or innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother Ben. The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is related to the interpretation of the pathological findings.

1. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have occurred a matter of hours before death is based on pathological interpretation. If Jane is not guilty, the critical question is whether this timing is still plausible under alternative scenarios.

2. **Alternative Scenarios**: If Jane did not smother Ben, the hypoxic damage could potentially be due to another cause or mechanism that occurred around the time of death. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) is still dependent on the pathological interpretation.

3. **Independence of Timing from Guilt**: The timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is a factual observation based on pathological evidence. Whether Jane is guilty or not does not directly affect the likelihood of when the hypoxic damage occurred; it's more about the interpretation of the cause.

Given this, if the pathological evidence suggests that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, this observation stands regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence. The likelihood of this timing is not directly influenced by whether Jane is guilty or not; it's about the pathological interpretation.

Therefore, the assessment of the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death should be based on the credibility and reliability of the pathological evidence rather than Jane's guilt or innocence.

Probability judgment: 90
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings that do not involve Jane's guilt (i.e., smothering or abuse by Jane).

1. **Alternative Causes for Injuries**: The injuries described can be indicative of trauma or abuse. If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are plausible alternative explanations for these findings. Other individuals could have caused the injuries, or there could be accidental explanations.

2. **Accidental or Medical Explanations**: Some of the findings (like bruises) could potentially be due to accidental trauma, though a torn frenulum is often associated with significant trauma, often in the context of abuse. Blood in the lung could be due to various causes, including resuscitation attempts or underlying medical conditions.

3. **Misinterpretation**: It's also possible that the original autopsy missed these findings due to less sophisticated techniques or less thorough examination, and their presence doesn't necessarily imply Jane's guilt.

If Jane is not guilty, for these findings to be present, there would need to be a plausible alternative explanation. While the injuries are suggestive of non-accidental injury, they are not exclusively diagnostic of smothering by Jane. Other scenarios could potentially explain these findings, though they might be less likely.

The probability judgment should reflect how plausible it is for these findings to occur under the condition that Jane is not guilty.

Probability judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these similarities could occur by chance or due to other factors unrelated to Jane's actions.

1. **Similar Age and Circumstances**: The fact that both babies were about the same age and died under similar circumstances (time of day, after being fed, found unconscious by Jane when she was alone) could be coincidental or due to shared underlying factors not related to Jane's guilt.

2. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, and both deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes, the similarity in age and circumstances could be due to the natural history of these conditions or the typical patterns of infant care and observation.

3. **Statistical Probability**: The probability of two siblings dying from SIDS is extremely low, but the specific circumstances (age, time of day, etc.) could still align by chance.

4. **Shared Environment and Care**: The fact that both babies were cared for by Jane (and possibly others in similar ways) could contribute to similarities in their circumstances at the time of death.

If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities depends on how unusual or common these circumstances are among infant deaths or SIDS cases. While some similarities could be coincidental, the combination of factors (age, time of day, being found by Jane after feeding) might be less likely to occur by chance alone.

However, it's also worth noting that the similarities could be highlighted or perceived as more significant due to the context of the case and the fact that they are being scrutinized.

The probability judgment should reflect how likely it is for these similarities to occur under the condition that Jane is not guilty.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings that are consistent with innocence.

1. **Understanding the findings**: Hypoxic damage (due to lack of oxygen) and haemorrhages (bleeding) in the eyes and eyelids can be indicative of asphyxiation or smothering, as these are signs that can result from obstruction of the airway. However, these symptoms are not exclusive to smothering and can be caused by other forms of asphyxia or medical conditions.

2. **Alternative explanations for the findings**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether there could be other reasons for Ben's condition. For instance, SIDS, other medical conditions, or an accidental cause could potentially lead to hypoxic damage or similar symptoms. However, SIDS typically does not present with such clear signs of trauma or asphyxia. The presence of significant injuries like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is not characteristic of SIDS.

3. **SIDS and its presentation**: SIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained, and thorough investigation including autopsy does not reveal a cause of death. The injuries described for Ben (and retrospectively for Andy) are not typical for SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be SIDS or another natural cause), the presence of these specific injuries suggests an alternative explanation is needed.

4. **Considering other causes**: While it's possible that an undiagnosed medical condition or accident could result in some similar symptoms, the pattern described is highly suggestive of asphyxiation. In the context of innocence (Jane not smothering the children), one would need to look for other plausible causes that could result in these findings.

5. **Assessing likelihood**: The described injuries are not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of death in infants. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate, there would need to be another explanation for these injuries. The likelihood of such severe and specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring without foul play or smothering is low because these are not characteristic of the usual profile for SIDS or most other natural infant deaths.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be considered low because these findings strongly suggest asphyxiation or trauma, which contradicts the premise of innocence (unless another cause for these injuries is identified).

**Probability judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings that are consistent with Jane's innocence. 

The key alternative explanation provided is that the deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, as well as the re-examination findings in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), are specific pathological changes that are not typically characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The findings in Ben, particularly the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause, such as smothering, rather than SIDS. While it's theoretically possible for an infant to experience hypoxia (low oxygen levels) due to various reasons, the specific constellation of findings in Ben is more commonly associated with asphyxiation or smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). However, the specific autopsy findings in Ben are not typical for SIDS. 

The likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring in the context of SIDS or another non-violent, non-traumatic cause is low because these are not characteristic features of SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, it would be unusual for Ben to have these specific autopsy findings.

Probability judgment: 20 

(This judgment reflects the low likelihood of the specific autopsy findings being consistent with SIDS or another natural cause, given that they are more commonly associated with asphyxiation or trauma.)

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that Andy's death was not due to her actions, such as smothering or other forms of abuse. The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of trauma or abuse. 

A torn frenulum is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding/bottle feeding, and bruises on the arms and legs, along with blood in the lung, suggest significant trauma. These findings are not typical for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The presence of these specific injuries in Andy suggests that there might have been some form of trauma or abuse. If Jane is not guilty, it raises questions about alternative explanations for these findings. However, given that the initial autopsy suggested natural causes and there were no other suspects or explanations provided for these injuries, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring in the context of SIDS or an accidental cause is low.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings is low, as they are more indicative of non-accidental injury.

Probability judgment: 5

(This judgment reflects a very low likelihood, as the findings are strongly suggestive of non-accidental injury rather than an accidental or natural cause.)

5
The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and the interpretation of the autopsy findings. If Jane is not guilty, the cause of Ben's death and the timing of the hypoxic damage would not be directly related to her actions.

The timing of the hypoxic damage is a medical assessment that depends on various factors, including the nature and duration of the hypoxic event. If the medical assessment is correct, the timing of the hypoxic damage would be independent of Jane's guilt or innocence.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is still determined by the medical evidence and not directly by Jane's guilt or innocence. The medical evidence would stand regardless of Jane's guilt.

However, considering that the question is asking for a probability judgment based on Jane's innocence, and given that the timing of the hypoxic damage is a fact that is established through medical assessment rather than directly related to Jane's actions or guilt, the probability judgment should reflect the likelihood based on the available medical information.

Since the medical assessment suggests that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, and this assessment is not directly dependent on Jane's guilt or innocence, the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death remains high regardless of Jane's guilt.

Probability judgment: 90 

(This judgment assumes that the medical assessment is correct and that the timing of the hypoxic damage is a factual determination based on the autopsy findings.)

90
If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents would be due to coincidence or other factors unrelated to Jane's actions. The factors mentioned include the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died after being fed, and the circumstance of being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

While the age of the babies and the time of day they died could be considered coincidental, given that both were infants and likely followed a similar routine, the fact that both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them could be seen as a circumstance that, while unfortunate, might not be entirely surprising given that she was their caregiver.

However, the combination of these factors (age, time of day, circumstances) being similar for both incidents is noteworthy. If we consider the possibility that both deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the similarity in circumstances (being found by Jane when alone) might still occur simply because Jane was the primary caregiver.

The probability of these similarities occurring by chance, assuming both deaths were natural or accidental (and Jane is not guilty), involves considering the likelihood of these specific circumstances aligning in both cases.

Given that there are plausible explanations for some of these similarities (e.g., both being infants and following a routine), but the combination of all these factors is still quite specific, the likelihood of these similarities is not extremely high but is still possible.

Probability judgment: 40 

(This judgment reflects a moderate likelihood. The circumstances of both deaths being similar could occur by chance, especially in the context of a caregiver like Jane being present in both instances. However, the combination of these specific factors still makes the occurrence somewhat unlikely to be purely coincidental.)

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben at the time of his death. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia, which can cause a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) leading to such injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother Ben. In this case, we need to consider other possible causes for the observed injuries. 

1. **Accidental or Non-Inflicted Causes**: Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages can result from various medical conditions or accidents. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxia could potentially cause similar findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more typically associated with asphyxial events, which could be either smothering or accidental asphyxia.

2. **SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant autopsy findings. While some SIDS cases might present with minor pathological changes, significant injuries like those described for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical for a diagnosis of SIDS.

Given the specific injuries to Ben, if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother him), we need to consider the likelihood of these injuries occurring from other causes. While it's possible to have alternative explanations for these findings, such as accidental asphyxia or other rare medical conditions, the described pattern is highly suggestive of an asphyxial event.

The question then becomes how likely it is for Ben to have suffered these specific injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) without being smothered by Jane. If we are to consider alternative explanations, the presence of such significant and specific injuries points towards a non-natural cause, which could include accidental asphyxia or other trauma not inflicted by Jane.

However, without more specific information on alternative causes or evidence that might exonerate Jane or point to another cause, we're left to consider the likelihood based on the information given.

The injuries described are consistent with asphyxia, and while not all asphyxial events are due to smothering by another person, the presence of these injuries makes an explanation like SIDS less likely due to the significant pathological findings.

Thus, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurring due to other causes (not smothering by Jane) would depend on the existence and likelihood of those alternative causes.

**Given the context and typical interpretations of such injuries in forensic pathology**, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these specific injuries occurred anyway (due to other causes) is relatively low because the described pattern is strongly indicative of asphyxia.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben could be indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and potentially some form of trauma or asphyxiation. However, the absence of guilt on Jane's part suggests we are looking for an alternative cause.

1. **Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: These findings are consistent with asphyxiation or smothering but can also be associated with other conditions that result in hypoxia. 

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider if there are other plausible explanations for Ben's condition. 

   - **SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't typically present with the specific autopsy findings seen in Ben, it's considered when there's no other clear cause. However, the specific findings in Ben (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are not typical for SIDS.

   - **Accidental or Other Forms of Trauma**: If not due to Jane's actions, other forms of accidental or non-accidental trauma by another person could potentially cause such injuries. However, the scenario doesn't provide evidence of such.

   - **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions could potentially lead to hypoxic damage or could mimic some of the findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries and autopsy findings in Ben, along with the re-evaluation of Andy's autopsy, suggests a more acute event rather than an underlying chronic condition.

3. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, we're left to explain the findings through other means. While it's possible that Ben suffered from an extremely rare condition or an undetermined cause that resulted in hypoxia and the observed autopsy findings, the described autopsy results strongly suggest some form of asphyxiation or trauma.

Given the information and the fact that the findings in both children were re-evaluated and found to have signs consistent with non-accidental injury (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung in Andy; hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben), if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to other causes (not related to her actions) is low because they are strongly indicative of a non-natural cause.

The presence of similar, albeit initially undetected, signs in both children further suggests a related cause.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects a low likelihood that the specific pattern of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben occurred without Jane being guilty, given that these findings are more commonly associated with asphyxiation or smothering. The absence of clear alternative explanations that fit the observed pattern in both children makes it less likely that these findings are coincidental or due to natural causes or unrelated factors.
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The condition described for Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, is indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. 

1. **Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages Explained by SIDS or Other Causes**: SIDS is often considered when there's an unexpected death in infancy without a clear cause after thorough investigation. However, the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not typically associated with SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not attributed to a specific cause or trauma but rather to an unexplained event.

2. **Alternative Causes for Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages**: There are other potential causes for hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in infants, such as accidental or non-accidental injuries (though the latter implies guilt), infections, or congenital conditions. However, the presence of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more commonly associated with a violent or traumatic cause, including smothering.

3. **Interpreting the Evidence if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if there are other plausible explanations for Ben's condition. The description provided strongly suggests some form of trauma or smothering. If we rule out Jane's guilt, we must look for other potential causes or explanations for the observed injuries.

However, the description given closely aligns with what one might expect from smothering or other forms of violent trauma. SIDS, by definition, is not associated with such specific traumatic findings. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (and thus did not smother Ben), the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred is still relatively low because these are not characteristic of SIDS.

The critical point is that the medical findings are not typical for SIDS but are suggestive of a more traumatic or violent cause. If Jane is innocent, one has to consider an alternative explanation for these findings. However, the given information strongly points towards a violent or traumatic cause.

Given this context, the probability that Ben would have these specific injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) if Jane is not guilty is relatively low, because the injuries are suggestive of a cause (like smothering) that would imply Jane's guilt.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
If Jane is not guilty, it means that she did not smother her children. The question then is how likely it is that Ben's autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are consistent with an alternative cause, such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion where no cause of death is found after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages typically indicates that there was some form of stress or insult to the infant before death, which does not align well with the classic definition of SIDS as lacking any identifiable cause.

However, it's known that certain conditions or events can lead to hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in infants, and these can sometimes be associated with natural diseases or accidental causes. But the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is often associated with smothering or asphyxia.

If we are to consider Jane not guilty, we must then consider alternative explanations for Ben's injuries. While SIDS is often cited as a potential cause in cases of unexpected infant death, the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. 

The literature and expert opinion in forensic pathology often suggest that such findings are more indicative of asphyxial or traumatic injury rather than SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying that the death was not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her), it becomes challenging to attribute these specific autopsy findings to SIDS or a completely natural cause without other evidence.

Given the information and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings occurring without smothering or violent trauma is relatively low because the autopsy results strongly suggest some form of asphyxiation or trauma.

Probability judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother Ben. In this context, we're examining the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death without attributing it to Jane's actions.

The timing of hypoxic damage before death can be influenced by various factors, including the cause of the hypoxia. If Ben experienced a natural or accidental event leading to hypoxia (such as a severe infection, accidental asphyxia not caused by Jane, or another medical condition), the timing of this event relative to his death would depend on the specifics of that condition.

However, the statement that the hypoxic damage "must have been caused a matter of hours before death" is a medical opinion based on the examination. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the medical opinion is correct that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death, we are left to consider whether there could be other plausible explanations for this timing.

Given that the medical expert's opinion is based on the pathology findings, if those findings indicate that the damage occurred hours before death, it's reasonable to consider that this timing is relatively independent of Jane's guilt or innocence regarding the act of smothering. Instead, it's about the interpretation of the pathology.

Therefore, if the medical expert is correct in their assessment that the damage occurred hours before death based on the pathology, then the likelihood of this being true is not directly dependent on Jane's guilt or innocence.

Probability judgment: 80
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the injuries to Andy through abuse or smothering. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury or abuse.

The likelihood of these findings being present in Andy without Jane being guilty would depend on alternative explanations for these injuries. While it's possible to conceive of scenarios where such injuries could occur accidentally, the combination and nature of these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are often associated with non-accidental trauma.

For instance, a torn frenulum is commonly associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, and blood in the lung can result from significant trauma or asphyxia. Bruises on the arms and legs could be indicative of gripping or handling with force.

If Jane is not guilty, one would need to consider other potential perpetrators or accidental causes. However, given the nature of these injuries and the context (infant care), alternative explanations that do not involve abuse or neglect are less plausible.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring without any other form of non-accidental trauma or abuse is low.

Probability judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the incidents involving Andy and Ben's deaths would be considered coincidental or due to other factors not related to Jane's actions.

Both babies being about the same age at death could be coincidental, given that they are siblings and might share similar developmental stages and vulnerabilities. The fact that they died at a similar time of day after being fed could be related to various factors, including their age and feeding schedules.

However, the combination of these similarities, especially that both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, is noteworthy. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider whether these similarities could arise from other factors, such as a genetic predisposition to certain conditions, environmental factors, or simply coincidence.

The probability of two infants in the same family dying under similar circumstances (same age, time of day relative to feeding, and being found by the same person when alone with them) without any foul play is extremely low, especially considering that SIDS, the alternative explanation, is relatively rare (1 in 4,000).

While it's possible to argue that the circumstances could be coincidental, the convergence of these specific details is unusual.

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries found during the autopsy, suggests that there was some form of distress or issue before death. However, SIDS can sometimes be associated with findings that might suggest prior hypoxia or stress, though the exact mechanisms are not well understood.

The key issue here is whether the hypoxic damage being caused "a matter of hours before death" is consistent with a scenario where Jane is not guilty (i.e., the death is due to SIDS or another natural/accidental cause).

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of sufficient oxygen. In the context of infants, this could be due to various reasons such as respiratory distress or obstruction of the airway.

2. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The timing of hypoxic damage can vary. If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could be seen as part of the syndrome or as a separate condition. However, SIDS by definition is sudden and unexpected, and it is not typically characterized by a clear, identifiable period of hypoxia hours before death.

3. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage to have occurred "a matter of hours before death," it would need to be part of a process or condition that is separate from or related to the cause of death. SIDS is not typically associated with a clear, prolonged period of distress or hypoxia that is identified hours before death.

However, some infants may experience stress or distress before SIDS, and it's possible that this could lead to or be associated with hypoxic damage. The question then becomes how likely it is that such damage occurred hours before death if Jane is not guilty.

Without specific medical evidence linking the timing of hypoxic damage directly to SIDS or other non-suspicious causes, we must consider the available information. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death is not directly supported or refuted by the information given about SIDS. SIDS is unpredictable and not fully understood.

Given the lack of clear information directly linking the timing of hypoxic damage to the innocence of Jane and considering that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (made when other causes are ruled out), the probability hinges on understanding the medical evidence and its implications.

To provide a probability judgment, we consider that if Jane is not guilty, the scenario of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death may not be directly related to her guilt or innocence but rather to the underlying cause of death.

The probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is somewhat speculative without more specific information on how SIDS or other natural causes might relate to such damage. However, it's worth noting that the presence of significant hypoxic damage might be seen as inconsistent with a completely "sudden" death as typically described in SIDS, suggesting some form of prior distress.

Given these considerations and the need to provide a numerical judgment at the end:

**50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age.

The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen, which could be due to various reasons, including smothering or other causes leading to asphyxiation. If Jane is not guilty, then the death and the injuries found on Ben (and retrospectively on Andy) would need to be explained by other factors.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain a matter of hours before death could be consistent with a natural or accidental cause if we consider that the infant might have experienced some distress or condition leading to reduced oxygenation. However, the doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline that might not directly correlate with SIDS, as SIDS is typically associated with a sudden death without a clear preceding period of hypoxia that is identified or reported.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we are operating under the assumption that the cause of death might not be smothering or any form of intentional act by Jane. The presence of hypoxic damage could still be due to natural or accidental causes, but the timing (a matter of hours before death) might not align well with the typical profile of SIDS, which is generally sudden and without a clear preceding hypoxic episode that is medically documented.

Given that the exact mechanism of SIDS is unknown, and it is defined by the lack of a clear cause of death after thorough investigation, it's challenging to directly link the hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death to SIDS or other natural causes without more specific medical evidence.

However, if we are to assess the likelihood based on the information given and the assumption that Jane is not guilty (implying we are looking for an alternative explanation), the critical issue is whether the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is consistent with a non-criminal cause of death.

If Jane is not guilty, and we consider alternative explanations for Ben's death, such as SIDS or another medical condition, the fact that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death might be less likely under the SIDS hypothesis because SIDS typically implies a sudden death without a documented period of hypoxia preceding it.

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and given the constraints of the information, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death due to a non-criminal cause might be considered relatively low because it implies a detectable period of distress or hypoxia, which is not typically how SIDS is described.

Likelihood judgment: 20
If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found on Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) need to be explained by alternative causes that are not related to abuse or smothering by Jane.

The presence of these injuries is often associated with non-accidental trauma or abuse. However, if we are to consider that Jane is not guilty, we must look for other possible explanations.

Bruises can occur due to accidental trauma, although the presence of bruises on an 11-week-old infant is unusual and warrants further investigation. A torn frenulum can occur during a difficult delivery or due to other medical conditions or accidents, although it is also a known indicator of non-accidental injury. Blood in the lung can be due to various medical conditions or resuscitation efforts.

While these injuries could be indicative of abuse, it's also possible, although less likely, that they could be due to other causes. For example, medical conditions or accidents could potentially explain some of these findings.

However, the combination of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in an 11-week-old infant is highly unusual and typically raises concerns about non-accidental injury.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming these injuries were not due to her actions, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring due to other causes is relatively low because they are not typical of usual infant conditions or accidents at this age.

Likelihood judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an explanation for the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids that does not involve her direct action or intent to harm.

The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of asphyxiation or significant stress/trauma. While these findings are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, they could potentially be explained by other rare medical conditions or accidents that result in asphyxiation or significant distress.

However, the specific combination of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is highly suggestive of a severe and potentially violent or traumatic event. In the absence of Jane's guilt, one would need to consider other potential causes for these findings, such as an accidental or natural cause that mimics the effects of smothering.

The likelihood of these specific findings occurring without any foul play or negligence is relatively low. While it's not impossible that a rare medical condition or an accident could result in similar findings, the pattern of injuries is highly unusual and typically associated with non-accidental trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to other causes is relatively low.

Likelihood judgment: 15
If Jane is not guilty, the deaths of Andy and Ben would likely be attributed to natural causes or accidents, such as SIDS. The similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies at death, the time of day, and the circumstances surrounding their discovery, are striking.

SIDS is known to be more common in certain age ranges (typically between 1-4 months) and can occur at any time. While the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, it is possible for multiple instances of SIDS to occur in the same family, although this is extremely rare.

The fact that both babies were found unconscious by Jane after being fed and when she was alone with them could be coincidental, given that she was their primary caregiver. The similarity in the timing and circumstances could be due to a combination of circumstances and the fact that both infants were at a similar age.

However, the probability of two SIDS deaths occurring under such similar circumstances in the same family is extremely low. Research and statistics on SIDS suggest that while it is possible for more than one SIDS death to occur in a family, the likelihood is very small.

Given the rarity of SIDS and the specific similarities between the two incidents, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance is still relatively low, but it is not impossible.

To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances under which both babies died and the information given about SIDS.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS can occur at any time during the first year of life, with a peak incidence between 1-4 months. The ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths fall within this range, making their deaths potentially consistent with SIDS in terms of age.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can happen at any time, and there's no specific correlation with feeding times, though it's sometimes associated with sleep. The fact that both were found unconscious by Jane after being alone with her doesn't directly relate to SIDS but is a circumstance that could occur given that she was their primary caregiver.

3. **Similarities and SIDS**: The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother them), the similarity in circumstances could be due to other factors or simply coincidence. SIDS is, by definition, unexplained, and its occurrence is considered to be due to a complex interplay of environmental and intrinsic factors.

To evaluate the likelihood of these similarities under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely it is for two SIDS deaths to occur in the same family under similar circumstances. 

- The probability of a single SIDS death is given as 1 in 4,000.
- The probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is significantly lower because it involves the conjunction of two independent low-probability events. Assuming independence (which might not be entirely valid due to potential shared environmental or genetic factors), the probability would be the product of the two probabilities: (1/4000) * (1/4000).

However, the question is not directly asking for the probability of two SIDS deaths but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities if Jane is not guilty.

The probability that both babies died of SIDS and that the circumstances surrounding their deaths happened to be similar (age, time of day, being found by Jane) involves complex considerations of conditional probabilities and the likelihood of these events occurring together.

Given that SIDS is an unexplained phenomenon and that the circumstances (age, time relative to feeding, found by Jane) could happen by chance, we need to assess how likely it is for these coincidences to occur.

The critical insight is that if Jane is not guilty and both deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause, the similarities might still occur by chance. For instance, both being young infants, both being cared for primarily by Jane, and both dying suddenly are not unlikely given the context.

To directly quantify the likelihood of the specific similarities (age, time of day, discovered by Jane) under the assumption that Jane is not guilty requires detailed statistical analysis and knowledge of the distribution of these factors in SIDS deaths, which is not provided.

However, intuitively, if we are considering the scenario where Jane is innocent and the deaths are due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the similarity in the circumstances (both being found by Jane, around the same age) could be seen as unfortunate coincidences rather than evidence of a deliberate act.

Given the lack of direct statistical information on the distribution of these specific similarities in SIDS cases and the low probability of two SIDS events occurring, a precise numerical probability judgment about the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty involves many assumptions.

**75**
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the nature of the events and the information provided.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS can occur at any time during the first year of life, but it is more common between 1-4 months. The ages of Andy and Ben at their deaths fall within this range, making their deaths plausible as SIDS in terms of age.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is not directly linked to feeding. However, it's known that SIDS often occurs during sleep or periods of rest.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother them), the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. The similarities in circumstances (age, time of day, being found by Jane) could be coincidental or related to common factors not associated with Jane's actions (e.g., environmental, genetic).

Let's consider the probability of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is innocent:

- **Age**: The probability that both died within a similar age range (under 3 months) is relatively high because SIDS is more common in this period.
- **Time of Day and After Being Fed**: Infants are frequently fed and then put to sleep, so it's not unusual for deaths to occur after feeding if they happen during sleep.

However, the exact probability of these specific similarities occurring is complex to quantify directly from the given data. We need to consider the probability of the deaths being SIDS or another cause and then the likelihood of the observed similarities under those conditions.

SIDS is rare (1 in 4,000), and the probability of it happening twice in the same family is extremely low, often cited as the square of the probability for a single event under assumptions of independence (though in reality, there might be familial factors that slightly increase or decrease this risk). However, the question isn't directly asking us to calculate the probability of two SIDS events but rather the likelihood of the observed similarities if Jane is innocent.

The critical point is that if Jane is innocent, and both deaths are due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the specific circumstances (age, time of day, being found by Jane) could still be coincidental. The fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found is more a reflection of the typical childcare arrangement than evidence of guilt.

Given the rarity of SIDS and assuming the events are independent, the probability of both occurring under similar circumstances by chance would be low, but not as low as the product of the probabilities of two SIDS events happening (since we're not directly calculating that).

To simplify, we're not calculating the probability of two SIDS events, which would be (1/4000)^2, but rather assessing how likely it is to observe the specific similarities under the assumption of innocence.

The probability judgment is thus not directly quantifiable with the given data but involves understanding that while rare events (like SIDS) happening twice are very unlikely, the specific similarities observed could still occur by chance.

Given the information and focusing on the judgment regarding the likelihood of the observed similarities under the assumption of Jane's innocence, we need to approach it with a logical deduction based on the available facts.

Probability Judgment: 20
The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, as found in the re-examination, are indicative of potential abuse or trauma. If Jane is not guilty, these findings would be expected to be unrelated to her actions.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of accidental injury or, in some contexts, non-accidental injury (NAI). However, infants can sometimes sustain minor injuries during normal handling or accidental drops, though significant bruising is less common in very young infants who are not yet mobile.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered a significant indicator of potential non-accidental injury, particularly in non-mobile infants, as it suggests a significant force was applied, possibly during feeding or other interactions involving the mouth.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of significant trauma or other serious conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these findings would need to be explained by other factors. For a non-guilty Jane, these signs could potentially be the result of an accident or another explanation not related to her intentional actions.

However, given the specific nature of these findings (especially the torn frenulum and blood in the lung), which are strongly associated with non-accidental injury, it's challenging to attribute them to accidental or natural causes without further context.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific and significant signs of trauma being present is relatively low, as they are not typical of normal infant care or accidental injury in a non-mobile infant.

Probability Judgment: 5
The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are significant findings that are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. If Jane is not guilty, these findings need to be explained by alternative causes.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This indicates a lack of oxygen to the brain, which can occur due to various reasons, including smothering, but also other medical conditions or accidents that result in asphyxia or severe respiratory distress.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are indicative of significant trauma or increased pressure, which could be associated with smothering or violent shaking.

If Jane is not guilty, attributing these findings to accidental or natural causes without any evidence of external trauma or other clear explanations becomes challenging. While it's theoretically possible that such injuries could occur through rare or unusual accidental means, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is strongly associated with non-accidental injury.

In the absence of a plausible alternative explanation that aligns with Jane's innocence (e.g., a rare medical condition or an accident that could cause such specific injuries), the likelihood of these findings occurring without Jane being guilty is low.

Probability Judgment: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death implies that someone or something else caused this damage close to the time of death. 

The doctor's statement suggests a timeline for when the hypoxic damage occurred, linking it to the events immediately preceding Ben's death. If Jane is not guilty, it means that either another person was responsible for the damage or it occurred due to an accident or natural cause.

However, if the hypoxic damage was indeed caused a matter of hours before death and is linked to the cause of death, and given that Jane was alone with Ben when he was found unresponsive, it raises questions about who or what could have caused this damage if not Jane.

The likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death due to a cause unrelated to Jane's actions (if she is not guilty) depends on finding an alternative explanation for both the damage and the fact that Jane was alone with Ben when he was found.

Given the context that Jane was alone with Ben and the specific timing of the hypoxic damage, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes challenging to attribute the cause of the damage to another source or accident without contradicting the given circumstances.

To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can result from various causes, not just smothering or violent trauma. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen, which can occur due to several reasons such as respiratory issues, cardiac problems, or asphyxiation (which includes smothering). Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be caused by trauma, but they can also be associated with other conditions or events that cause increased venous pressure.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering or other violent actions by Jane. In this case, we need to consider other possible explanations for Ben's autopsy findings.

1. **SIDS or another natural cause**: The scenario suggests SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some studies suggest that certain pathological findings can be present in SIDS cases, such as mild intrathoracic petechiae, the presence of significant hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not typical for a classic SIDS diagnosis.

2. **Other medical conditions or accidents**: Other medical conditions or accidental events could potentially cause the observed injuries. For instance, a severe infection or a congenital condition could potentially lead to some of the observed findings, though this would be subject to further investigation.

3. **Misinterpretation or alternative causes of the autopsy findings**: It's also possible that the autopsy findings could be misinterpreted or have alternative explanations not directly related to smothering or trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate and not due to a misdiagnosis, we still need to reconcile these findings with a plausible alternative cause.

However, the specific autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are indicative of a severe lack of oxygen and/or significant stress or trauma. While it's not impossible that such findings could be associated with other conditions or rare events, they are not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are due to some other cause is lower than if they were directly caused by her actions. The probability of these findings being present under the assumption of innocence (and not due to smothering or similar violent trauma by Jane) depends on the existence of plausible alternative explanations.

Given the information and typical understanding of SIDS and the autopsy findings, it's challenging to assert a high likelihood for these findings under the assumption of Jane's innocence without more context on alternative causes.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that hypoxic damage and haemorrhages can result from various causes, not solely from smothering or violent trauma. For instance, hypoxic damage can occur due to issues related to the infant's respiratory system, cardiac problems, or other medical conditions that impair oxygen supply to the brain. Haemorrhages in infants can also be caused by birth trauma, infections, or bleeding disorders.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other medical conditions. However, the specific findings of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages as described are not typical for SIDS. SIDS is, by definition, a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when no other cause of death can be found after thorough investigation and autopsy.

The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages indicates that there might have been an issue that led to these pathological changes. While it's possible that these could be related to a natural cause or an accident not related to Jane's actions, the described autopsy findings are more suggestive of a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than a straightforward SIDS or other natural causes.

However, without more specific information on the nature and extent of these injuries, and considering that the question posits Jane's innocence, we must consider the possibility that these findings could be due to other factors or misinterpretation.

To evaluate the likelihood that these findings occurred if Jane is not guilty, we have to consider the probability that these autopsy results could be explained by other causes. While the described injuries (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are more indicative of asphyxia or trauma, it's not impossible that rare or unusual medical conditions or other non-traumatic causes could result in similar autopsy findings.

Given the context that these findings are not typical for SIDS and assuming Jane's innocence, the likelihood that these specific autopsy findings occurred due to other (non-traumatic or non-suspect) causes is relatively low, as the described injuries are more commonly associated with asphyxia or trauma.

However, quantifying this likelihood is challenging without more detailed medical information.

The likelihood is low, but not impossible, that such findings could be due to non-suspect causes if Jane is not guilty.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To determine the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are typically associated with a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma.

2. **Smothering as a Cause**: Smothering can cause hypoxia, leading to brain damage and hemorrhages due to the physical act of obstructing the airway, which can also cause a struggle that might result in additional trauma.

3. **Alternative Causes for the Findings**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, we need to consider other potential causes for the observed autopsy findings. 
   - **SIDS**: The question posits SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when all other causes of death have been ruled out. Classic SIDS cases typically do not present with significant autopsy findings like those described for Ben.
   - **Accidental Causes**: Accidental causes that could potentially lead to similar findings (like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) are possible but would be unusual and not directly related to SIDS.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: 
   - SIDS is not typically associated with significant autopsy findings like hypoxic brain damage or hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. The presence of such findings usually indicates a cause other than SIDS.
   - If Jane is not guilty, for the autopsy findings to still be explained, there would need to be another plausible cause for the observed injuries. 

5. **Conclusion**: Given the specific autopsy findings for Ben, which are not typical for SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (i.e., she did not smother Ben), the likelihood of these specific findings occurring due to another cause such as an accidental or natural cause that mimics smothering is low. The described injuries are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring is low because these are indicative of a traumatic or violent cause rather than a natural or accidental one.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of violent trauma inflicted by her. The question then becomes about the likelihood of the observed injuries (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring in the context of an alternative explanation for their deaths, such as SIDS.

SIDS, by definition, is a sudden and unexplained death in infancy that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben's autopsy is not typical for SIDS, as SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death is found. These findings suggest some form of asphyxia or trauma.

However, the fact that further investigation into Andy's death also revealed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) that were initially not identified as being inconsistent with SIDS (since the initial autopsy suggested natural causes) complicates the interpretation. It indicates that both deaths may have had similar underlying causes or mechanisms, which were not initially recognized.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages would need an alternative explanation. However, these findings are more commonly associated with asphyxia or trauma rather than SIDS.

Therefore, if we are considering Jane's innocence and attributing the deaths to a cause other than smothering by her, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages occurred by chance or another natural cause is low because these findings are indicative of asphyxia or trauma.

Given the presence of these significant pathological findings, if Jane is not guilty, it is still necessary to explain these findings through another cause. The probability that these specific injuries occurred coincidentally or through a natural cause (like SIDS) is not high because SIDS does not typically present with such significant pathological evidence of asphyxia or trauma.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in infants can be indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. Smothering is one possible cause, as it can lead to hypoxia. However, other causes of hypoxia or trauma could potentially result in similar findings.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, we must consider other potential causes for the observed injuries and conditions. These could include accidental trauma, other forms of non-accidental injury not related to smothering (though this is not directly relevant if we are assuming Jane's innocence), or natural causes that might result in similar pathological findings.

3. **SIDS Consideration**: SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of specific injuries (like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) suggests that SIDS might not be a straightforward explanation for Ben's death, as SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of significant pathological findings at autopsy.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: Given that the findings are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, if Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider how likely these findings are under alternative explanations. 

The injuries to Ben could be the result of other, non-smothering related causes. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is strongly suggestive of a hypoxic event or significant trauma.

For an innocent Jane, the likelihood of these specific findings would depend on other potential causes. However, the forensic pathology suggests a violent or traumatic cause. 

If we were to attribute these findings to a non-suspicious cause (like an accidental or natural cause not related to smothering or Jane's action), we would be considering scenarios that are not directly supported by the information given (since SIDS is not typically associated with such specific pathological findings).

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings occurring due to other causes (not smothering or other actions by Jane) is relatively low because they are indicative of a significant hypoxic event or trauma.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

(This implies that, given Jane's innocence, there's still a possibility, albeit relatively low, that the observed hypoxic damage and haemorrhages could occur due to other causes or explanations not directly related to her actions. However, the specific pathology is suggestive of a traumatic or violent cause, making alternative innocent explanations less likely.)

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. The prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation that the injuries found in Ben, and later retrospectively in Andy, are indicative of smothering or other violent trauma.

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indeed indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and some form of stress or trauma. Smothering is one possible cause, as it would lead to asphyxiation and subsequently to hypoxic damage. However, these findings are not exclusive to smothering or violent trauma inflicted by Jane.

Other possible explanations for these findings could include:

1. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes:** While SIDS is often considered when there's an unexpected death of an infant, the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages might not be directly attributed to SIDS alone, as SIDS is typically diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

2. **Accidental or unintentional causes:** There could be other, non-criminal explanations for the observed injuries, such as an accidental event leading to asphyxiation or another medical condition that could cause similar symptoms.

However, the specific combination of hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more typically associated with a violent or traumatic cause, such as smothering. 

If Jane is not guilty, this implies an alternative explanation for the observed injuries is needed. Given that SIDS is not typically characterized by such specific traumatic findings, and other natural causes or accidents might not fully account for the combination of injuries observed, the likelihood of these findings occurring without Jane being guilty (i.e., without smothering or similar trauma) is relatively low.

The injuries observed are serious and not typical of a normal SIDS case or most natural causes. Therefore, the probability that these specific injuries occurred without Jane being guilty is relatively low, but quantifying this requires understanding that some conditions or rare accidents could theoretically lead to similar outcomes.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

Firstly, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or violently harm her children. The findings on Ben, which include hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. If Jane did not cause these injuries through smothering or other violent means, we have to consider other potential causes.

1. **Hypoxic Damage and Haemorrhages Explained by Other Causes**: Hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons not related to smothering, such as severe respiratory infection, congenital conditions affecting breathing, or other medical conditions that might impair oxygen supply to the brain.

2. **SIDS or Other Natural Causes**: The background information mentions SIDS as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of clear cause after thorough investigation, including autopsy. While some research suggests that certain pathological findings can be present in SIDS cases, significant trauma or clear signs of hypoxic damage as seen in Ben's case are not typical for a diagnosis of SIDS.

3. **Accidental or Other Non-Criminal Causes**: For hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be explained by non-criminal causes, there would need to be a plausible accidental or medical explanation. For instance, an undiagnosed medical condition or an accident that led to hypoxia.

However, the presence of significant hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, as described, is highly suggestive of a traumatic or violent cause rather than a natural or accidental non-criminal cause. 

If Jane is not guilty, implying that she did not smother the children, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred due to other, non-criminal causes is low because these findings strongly suggest a traumatic or violent act.

Given the information and focusing on the question of how likely these findings are if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether there are plausible alternative explanations for these specific injuries.

The probability that these specific findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) are due to natural causes or accident, given Jane is not guilty, is relatively low because these are not typical presentations of SIDS or other non-traumatic causes.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely that Ben suffered these specific injuries due to non-criminal causes.

**20**
To address the question, we need to analyze the given information and consider the likelihood of the observed injuries (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) if Jane is not guilty.

First, let's consider the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, which implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries described for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Causes for the Injuries**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for Ben's injuries. SIDS is mentioned as a possible cause for the deaths, but SIDS by definition is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically does not present with the significant pathological findings seen in Ben, such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages.

3. **SIDS and Pathological Findings**: SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. While the exact cause is unknown, deaths attributed to SIDS do not typically have the significant pathological findings seen in Ben. The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages suggests an underlying cause or event that led to these findings.

4. **Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it means we are looking for an alternative explanation for the observed injuries. However, the specific injuries to Ben are not typically associated with SIDS or other natural causes. They are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial event.

Given the information and focusing on the injuries to Ben, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider how likely these injuries are due to other causes. Since SIDS and other natural causes are not typically associated with such significant traumatic or asphyxial findings, the likelihood that these injuries occurred if Jane is not guilty (and thus attributing them to some other cause) is low.

The injuries described are strongly suggestive of a non-natural cause. Therefore, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty and look for an alternative explanation, we're left with a scenario that doesn't neatly fit known natural causes or SIDS due to the specific nature of Ben's injuries.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
If Jane is not guilty, that implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or any other violent trauma inflicted by Jane. The question then becomes how likely it is to observe the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if his death was not a result of smothering or other violent trauma.

First, let's consider the autopsy findings for Ben. Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be indicative of asphyxia or lack of oxygen. While these findings are consistent with smothering, they are not exclusive to smothering. Other conditions or accidental events could potentially lead to similar findings.

For instance, other causes of asphyxia or hypoxia (lack of oxygen) could result in similar damage. SIDS, by definition, is unexplained and could potentially involve some form of hypoxia or asphyxia without clear evidence of external trauma or smothering. However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy, such as haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical characteristics used to describe SIDS.

SIDS is diagnosed after a thorough investigation, including autopsy, and ruling out other causes of death. The presence of significant hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, as seen in Ben's case, suggests that there might have been an identifiable cause of death that could be related to asphyxia, even if not directly attributed to smothering by Jane.

The probability of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) in a context where Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering or causing violent trauma) depends on alternative explanations for these observations. While SIDS is a possibility for both deaths, the specific autopsy findings in Ben's case are not typical for SIDS.

However, there could be other, less common conditions or accidental asphyxia that could result in similar autopsy findings without Jane being guilty. 

Given the information and focusing on the likelihood of observing these specific findings under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we have to consider the possibility of other explanations that could result in similar autopsy results.

The presence of these findings still suggests a significant medical event. If we are to assume Jane's innocence, we are left to speculate on other potential causes that could result in similar findings.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma, respectively. These are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, then the cause of these injuries would not be due to smothering or any form of intentional harm inflicted by her. There could be other explanations, such as:
   - **Accidental or Natural Causes**: Certain conditions could lead to similar findings. For instance, severe infections, congenital conditions, or other medical emergencies could potentially cause hypoxia. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is more typically associated with asphyxial events.
   - **SIDS or Near-SIDS Events**: The question also raises SIDS as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS is diagnosed when the death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including autopsy. While SIDS is a leading cause of death in infants and is associated with some autopsy findings like intrathoracic petechiae, it is not typically characterized by the specific pattern of injuries seen in Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids).

3. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: 
   - The presence of specific injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and the pattern of injuries in Ben strongly suggests some form of trauma or asphyxial event.
   - If Jane is not guilty, these findings need to be explained by other causes. While it's plausible that there could be rare medical conditions or accidental events that could lead to similar findings, the specific constellation of injuries is highly suggestive of an asphyxial event or significant trauma.

4. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurred due to other (non-criminal) causes is relatively low, given the specific nature of these findings.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the given information and the context.

1. **Understanding the findings**: The autopsy on Ben revealed hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and are consistent with smothering or other forms of violent trauma.

2. **Considering alternative explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for Ben's death and the associated autopsy findings. One such alternative is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

3. **Analyzing SIDS as an alternative explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of death have been ruled out. While the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, it is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically within the first year of life. 

4. **Pathological findings in SIDS vs. smothering**: SIDS is not typically associated with specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage or hemorrhages seen in Ben's autopsy. Such findings usually indicate a different cause of death, such as smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

5. **Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in the context of SIDS**: The presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. These findings suggest an event or condition that caused asphyxia or significant stress to the infant before death.

6. **Considering the likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, then the observed injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) are less likely to be due to her actions. However, it's also possible that there was another cause or accident that led to these findings. The key here is whether these findings can be explained by a natural or accidental cause.

7. **Assessing probability**: While SIDS itself does not cause such specific and significant pathological changes, it's crucial to differentiate between SIDS and causes like accidental asphyxia or other non-homicidal events that could result in similar findings. However, the specific findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) are not characteristic of typical SIDS cases.

Given that the findings are not typical of SIDS and suggest an asphyxial event or significant trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that there could be another explanation for these findings. However, the presence of such specific and severe pathological changes makes it less likely that they are unrelated to an asphyxial or traumatic event.

Therefore, the likelihood that these findings occurred if Jane is not guilty (implying perhaps an accidental or natural but rare cause) is low because these specific findings are more commonly associated with asphyxia or trauma.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane's guilt implies she caused the injuries through smothering or other violent means.

First, let's understand that hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) and haemorrhages (bleeding) in the context of an infant's death can be caused by various factors, not solely by smothering or violent trauma inflicted by another person. 

1. **Hypoxic Damage to the Brain**: This can occur due to several reasons including, but not limited to, asphyxia (which could be caused by smothering), infections, congenital conditions, or accidents that lead to asphyxiation. 

2. **Haemorrhages to the Eyes and Eyelids**: These can be caused by trauma, but also by other medical conditions or birth-related injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, we're considering a scenario where the deaths could be due to natural causes or accidents not involving her direct harm. The given information also points to SIDS as a possible alternative explanation.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While it doesn't directly cause specific autopsy findings like hypoxic damage or haemorrhages, there are conditions that can mimic SIDS but actually represent other causes of death.

However, the specific findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are generally not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, made when other causes of death are ruled out.

The presence of significant autopsy findings like those described suggests that the death may not be attributed to SIDS or other natural causes without considering other possible explanations.

If Jane is not guilty, for the observed autopsy findings to be consistent with her innocence, there would need to be alternative explanations for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages. These could include accidental asphyxia, infection, or other medical conditions.

However, the described findings are generally considered to be indicative of some form of trauma or asphyxia, which complicates attributing them to SIDS or other natural causes directly.

Therefore, given the information that Jane is not guilty and considering the nature of the injuries found in Ben, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring under the condition that Jane is innocent (implying an alternative cause for the observed injuries) is relatively low because the autopsy findings strongly suggest a non-natural cause.

Given the complexity and the specific nature of the findings, attributing them to a non-criminal, non-traumatic cause if Jane is not guilty would be challenging.

**40**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings. The presence of such injuries is often associated with smothering or other forms of violent trauma. However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions, potentially attributing their deaths to other causes such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and increased pressure or trauma. These are often seen in cases of smothering or asphyxiation.

2. **Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for these findings. SIDS is mentioned as a possible explanation for the deaths. However, SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature, and typically, it does not present with the specific injuries found in Ben.

3. **SIDS and the Presence of Injuries**: The presence of significant injuries such as hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids is not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out, and it typically does not involve the kind of trauma or asphyxiation indicators seen in Ben.

4. **Other Natural or Accidental Causes**: Other than SIDS, if we consider accidental or natural causes, it's challenging to attribute the specific injuries found in Ben to a cause that doesn't involve some form of trauma or smothering. Certain conditions could potentially cause some of these findings, but they would be unusual and not directly related to SIDS.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, implying the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood of the observed injuries (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring due to other causes still needs to be assessed. Given that these injuries are suggestive of asphyxiation or trauma, attributing them to a non-criminal, non-traumatic cause is challenging without a clear alternative explanation.

6. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries to Ben are not due to her actions, the probability that these specific injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurred by other means is low because they strongly suggest a traumatic or asphyxial event. However, the exact probability depends on the availability and likelihood of alternative explanations.

Given the information and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty, attributing the specific injuries to an alternative cause that is not related to her actions is challenging. Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries occurring under the condition that Jane is not guilty is considered low.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To evaluate the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we first need to consider what it means for Jane to be not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. Given this context, we are examining the possibility that the observed injuries could occur without Jane's violent action (smothering).

The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and are often associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia. However, hypoxic damage and hemorrhages can also result from other causes, such as natural diseases or accidents that lead to asphyxiation.

If Jane is not guilty, several alternative explanations for Ben's condition could be considered:
1. **SIDS or another natural cause**: While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically doesn't present with the level of trauma described (hypoxic damage, hemorrhages), it is a consideration in infant deaths. However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are not typical of SIDS.

2. **Accidental asphyxiation or other accident**: This could potentially cause hypoxic damage. However, the specific pattern of injuries described is more typically associated with non-accidental injury.

3. **Natural disease**: Certain natural diseases or conditions could potentially cause some of the findings, though the combination and severity described are unusual for common natural infant diseases.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to be present without her having smothered Ben, there would need to be another plausible explanation for these findings. The described autopsy results are more commonly associated with asphyxial events, such as smothering, than with SIDS or most natural diseases.

However, it's also possible that the infants experienced some other catastrophic event or condition that was not directly related to Jane's actions but resulted in similar pathological findings.

The likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages) if Jane is not guilty is lower than if she is guilty because the findings are strongly associated with asphyxiation or smothering. However, without knowing the exact cause or another plausible explanation for these findings, we must consider that there could be rare or unusual circumstances that could lead to similar outcomes.

Therefore, considering the available information and the association of the described injuries with smothering, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings is relatively low, as they are more typically associated with non-accidental injury.

Probability judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the probability of these coincidences occurring naturally.

The similarities mentioned include:
1. Both babies being about the same age when they died.
2. Both dying at a similar time of day after being fed.
3. Both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were likely due to natural causes or accidents, such as SIDS, other natural diseases, or possibly other non-criminal events.

1. **Same age at death**: SIDS and some other infant mortality risks are age-related, with certain ages being more susceptible. Both infants dying at around the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) could be considered a coincidence but is within the realm of possibility given that both are within the age range where SIDS is a concern.

2. **Dying at a similar time of day after being fed**: The timing of infant deaths can be random, and there's no established strong correlation between feeding and the time of death in SIDS or other natural causes. However, it's plausible that both incidents happened at similar times due to the routine nature of infant care (e.g., feeding times).

3. **Found unconscious by Jane when alone**: It's a circumstance that could naturally occur given that Jane was the primary caregiver and thus more likely to be alone with the infants during their care.

The combination of these factors could be seen as coincidental, especially if one considers that both deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. However, the cumulative effect of these similarities is noteworthy.

The probability of these specific similarities occurring by chance is relatively low because it involves a combination of factors. However, given that Jane was the primary caregiver for both infants and that their deaths occurred within the age range where certain risks are more prevalent, some of these similarities could be attributed to the circumstances of their care and age.

To quantify this, we'd ideally need to consider the base rates of these events and their independence. However, given the information and simplifying the analysis, we can reason that while each of these factors alone might not be highly improbable, their combination is less likely.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths are due to natural causes or accidents, the probability of these similarities is not extremely high but is still within the realm of possible coincidence.

Probability judgment: 10
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The injuries described are typically associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or abuse. A torn frenulum is often considered a significant indicator of NAI, as it usually results from a direct blow to the mouth. Bruises to the arms and legs, while potentially accidental, can also be indicative of NAI, especially if they are numerous or in various stages of healing. Blood in the lung could result from various causes, including trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, these findings would need to be explained by other means. Possible explanations could include:
1. **Accidental trauma**: Though less likely for the combination and severity of the described injuries, it's possible that Andy experienced an accident that led to these findings. However, a torn frenulum and blood in the lung are not typical of most accidental injuries in infants.

2. **Medical conditions or natural diseases**: Certain medical conditions could potentially cause some of these findings, but they are not typical presentations for common infant diseases.

Given the nature of the injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung), they are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury than with accidental trauma or natural disease. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries is relatively low because they are strongly indicative of abuse.

Probability judgment: 5
The allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion based on the pathological findings. If Jane is not guilty, we are considering the scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering or abuse by Jane.

The timing of hypoxic damage is determined by the pathological examination, which assesses the stage of healing or the acute nature of the damage. The doctor's statement suggests that the hypoxic damage occurred relatively close to the time of death, based on the pathological findings.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to some other cause (natural or accidental), the timing of the hypoxic damage would still be determined by the pathological evidence.

The doctor's opinion is based on the pathological findings, not directly on Jane's guilt or innocence. Therefore, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death is not directly influenced by Jane's guilt or innocence but rather by the accuracy of the medical interpretation of the pathological findings.

If the medical evidence genuinely indicates that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, this would be the case regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence.

To evaluate the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's consider the given information and the condition of Ben when he was found unwell. The autopsy findings included hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are indicative of a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and possible trauma or smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death and injuries to Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). There are a few possibilities to consider in this context:

1. **SIDS or other natural causes**: SIDS is mentioned as an alternative explanation. However, SIDS typically does not present with significant autopsy findings like hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. While SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., it's considered when other causes are ruled out), the presence of such significant pathological findings makes SIDS less likely as the sole explanation.

2. **Accidental or other non-SIDS natural causes**: Other conditions or accidents could potentially cause similar findings. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages) is more typically associated with a violent or asphyxial event rather than a typical accidental injury or natural disease.

3. **Misinterpretation or incorrect diagnosis**: It's possible that the findings could be misinterpreted or that there's an alternative, less sinister explanation for the observed pathology.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, the observed autopsy findings in Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are still unexpected and not easily explained by SIDS or most other natural causes. The presence of these findings suggests some form of asphyxia or trauma. 

Therefore, in the context of Jane not being guilty and assuming an absence of other evidence pointing directly to her guilt, the likelihood that these findings occurred by chance or due to some other non-violent or non-criminal cause is relatively low.

However, we must still assign a probability based on the information given.

**Probability Judgment: 20**

This judgment reflects the low likelihood that the specific autopsy findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) in Ben are due to a non-violent or non-criminal cause if Jane is not guilty. It acknowledges that while the findings are suggestive of a violent or asphyxial cause, there could be rare or unusual explanations that might not involve Jane's guilt.

**20**
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

The given information suggests that if Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the deaths could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are stated to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, but it typically does not present with specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain or haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids that are indicative of a violent or traumatic cause of death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, implying that she did not smother her children, the presence of these specific injuries in Ben would need an alternative explanation. While it's possible for infants to suffer from various conditions that could result in similar findings (e.g., accidental trauma, other medical conditions), the specific constellation of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is more typically associated with asphyxia or smothering.

However, it's also worth noting that some research and medical literature suggest that certain findings like retinal hemorrhages can occur in a small percentage of SIDS cases, though this is not the same as saying these are typical or characteristic of SIDS.

Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are due to some other cause (not smothering by Jane) is relatively low because these findings are not typical for SIDS or other natural causes.

The probability judgment is: 20
If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother or abuse Andy. The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of trauma or abuse. 

The torn frenulum, for example, is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, which could be a sign of non-accidental injury. Similarly, bruises and blood in the lung are not typical findings in SIDS cases. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion made when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out, and it does not typically present with these specific types of injuries.

If Jane is not guilty, there are a few possible explanations for these findings:

1. **Alternative perpetrator**: Another person could have caused these injuries.
2. **Accidental trauma**: Though less likely given the nature of the injuries, it's possible they resulted from an accident.

However, given the specific nature of the injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), they are not typical of accidental trauma or SIDS. They are more characteristic of non-accidental injury or abuse.

The likelihood of these specific findings occurring in the absence of abuse (i.e., if Jane is not guilty and there's no other perpetrator) is low.

The probability judgment is: 10
If Jane is not guilty, the deaths of Andy and Ben are likely to be attributed to natural causes or accidents, with SIDS being a possible explanation mentioned in the context.

The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died after being fed, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could be considered coincidental if Jane is not guilty.

SIDS is known to occur more frequently in certain circumstances and at certain ages, typically within the first year of life and more commonly between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben were within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which could be seen as a coincidence given that they are siblings and might share similar risk factors or environmental conditions.

The fact that both died after being fed and were found by Jane when she was alone with them could be related to the routine care of infants and the likelihood of caregivers being present during these times.

While the similarities might initially seem suspicious, they can also be the result of the similar circumstances and ages of the two infants. However, the probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely low, given that the frequency of SIDS is about 1 in 4,000.

The probability of two siblings dying under similar circumstances due to SIDS or other natural causes is low, not because of the similarities in the circumstances of their deaths per se, but because of the rarity of SIDS occurring twice in the same family.

However, focusing strictly on the likelihood of the similarities between the incidents (age, time of day, being found unconscious by Jane after feeding) if Jane is not guilty, we are looking at how plausible it is for these coincidences to occur naturally.

The probability judgment is: 40
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain. The allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is a medical finding based on the autopsy.

The timing of the hypoxic damage is a matter of medical interpretation. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could have been caused by some other factor or event that occurred before Ben's death.

The fact that the damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" is a specific medical conclusion. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of this specific timing being correct would depend on whether there is an alternative explanation for the damage that is consistent with this timing.

However, the statement that the hypoxic damage "must have been caused a matter of hours before death" is a strong assertion that is based on medical expertise. If this assertion is accurate, the likelihood of the damage occurring at that time is not directly dependent on Jane's guilt or innocence but rather on the validity of the medical evidence and interpretation.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is still relatively high if we accept the medical expert's opinion as reliable.

The probability judgment is: 80

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's understand that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of abuse inflicted by Jane. The alternative explanation given is that their deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

The injuries found upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are typically considered indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI) or abuse. However, it's crucial to understand that these findings don't necessarily mean the injuries were inflicted by Jane or that they are directly related to smothering.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants is uncommon and typically raises concerns about potential abuse. However, it's also possible for infants to bruise accidentally, though this is less common.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the upper lip to the upper gum) can be a sign of a significant impact to the mouth, which is often associated with non-accidental injury. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is rare.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or non-accidental injury.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider that Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries could be seen as unrelated to the cause of death or potentially due to other factors not directly related to Jane's actions.

However, the presence of these specific injuries is generally considered to be indicative of some form of trauma. While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental injuries, the combination and nature of the injuries described are often taken as indicative of non-accidental trauma.

To directly assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty is challenging without more context on the probability of such injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or other non-suspicious circumstances. 

The probability of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) occurring in a scenario where Jane is not guilty (and assuming an alternative cause of death like SIDS) is low because these findings are typically associated with trauma.

Given the information provided and the typical interpretation of such injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present is lower than if she were guilty. However, quantifying this directly requires a nuanced understanding of the base rate of such injuries in infants dying from SIDS or other natural causes.

The literature does not frequently report on the incidence of such specific injuries in SIDS deaths, making it challenging to provide a precise probability. However, it's generally understood that such injuries are not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can occur due to various reasons, including accidental injury, birth trauma, or natural diseases. However, bruising in non-mobile infants is unusual and warrants further investigation. If Jane is not guilty, it's possible that the bruises were due to an accidental injury or a medical condition.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the tongue or upper lip to the gum) can be caused by a direct blow to the mouth or forced feeding. It can also occur accidentally, for example, during a fall onto an object. The context of the injury is crucial in determining its cause.

3. **Blood in the lung**: Blood in the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage) can be caused by a variety of factors including infection, trauma, or a natural disease process.

If Jane is not guilty of smothering Andy, there are a few possible explanations for the observed injuries and conditions:
- **Accidental injury or natural disease**: Some of the observed signs could be due to an accidental injury or an underlying medical condition that was not identified during the initial autopsy.
- **Misinterpretation of autopsy findings**: The findings could be misinterpreted or not accurately representative of the cause of death.

However, the presence of multiple signs such as bruising, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are now being associated with smothering or abuse, are concerning and not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and is not characterized by such specific traumatic injuries.

The likelihood of these findings (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty depends on alternative explanations for these signs. If we consider that these signs could be due to other causes (e.g., accidental trauma or underlying medical conditions not related to smothering or abuse), the likelihood would still be considered low because the presence of multiple such signs is unusual in the context of SIDS or accidental death.

However, without a clear alternative explanation that links these findings to a non-criminal cause, and given that the original autopsy did not identify these issues, the likelihood that these specific findings occurred in the absence of smothering or abuse is low.

The frequency and combination of these findings in SIDS cases are not typical. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these specific findings are present due to other causes is relatively low.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Understanding the Injuries**: The injuries described are often associated with non-accidental injury (NAI) or child abuse. A torn frenulum, for instance, is commonly linked with a blow to the mouth. Bruises on the arms and legs, and blood in the lung, can also be indicative of trauma.

2. **Alternative Explanations and SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be SIDS. However, the presence of the described injuries complicates this explanation because they are typically not associated with SIDS but rather with inflicted injury.

3. **Post-Mortem Artifacts and Natural Causes**: Some findings at autopsy can be artifacts or misinterpreted. For instance, certain conditions or the process of resuscitation can cause injuries that might be misattributed to abuse. However, specific findings like a torn frenulum are generally considered significant indicators of trauma.

4. **Re-examination Findings and Their Implications**: The re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealed signs that were initially not considered significant or were overlooked. If Jane is not guilty, one would need to consider whether these findings could be explained by other factors or if they were misinterpreted.

5. **Assessing Probability**: Given that the described injuries are typically associated with non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, we would need an alternative explanation for these injuries. The likelihood of such significant signs of potential abuse being present without any foul play is low. However, there could be rare instances where such findings are due to other causes or misinterpretation.

6. **Quantifying the Probability**: The injuries described are strong indicators of non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, the probability that Andy would still have these injuries is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS or other natural causes of death in infants.

Given the information and the need to provide a probability judgment:

The probability that Andy would have these injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is not guilty is low, because these are indicative of non-accidental injury.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and alternative explanations for these findings.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm by Jane. The alternative explanation provided is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding SIDS and its implications**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's diagnosed when all other possible causes of death have been ruled out. The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally not characteristic of SIDS. These findings are typically associated with non-accidental injury.

2. **Assessing the findings in the context of SIDS**: If Andy's death was due to SIDS, the presence of the mentioned injuries would be coincidental or due to another cause unrelated to Jane's actions. SIDS does not typically present with such injuries.

3. **Evaluating the likelihood**: The injuries described (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of trauma and are not typical in SIDS cases. The presence of these injuries suggests that there might be another explanation for Andy's death, potentially related to non-accidental injury.

However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we are looking for an explanation that does not involve her causing harm. In this context, we must consider whether these injuries could be present without being related to Jane's actions.

The torn frenulum and other injuries could potentially occur accidentally, though they are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury. The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, we're trying to assess the likelihood of these findings occurring in a context that is not related to her actions.

The probability we're trying to assess is essentially how likely it is for an infant who died of SIDS (or another natural cause, if we consider SIDS as part of a broader category of unexpected infant deaths) to have these specific injuries. 

Given that these injuries are not characteristic of SIDS but rather indicative of trauma, and in the absence of specific information that these injuries occurred accidentally or due to another medical condition, their presence is unusual.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the death was due to a cause like SIDS or another natural/accidental cause), the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring is low because they are not typical for SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem describes the case of Jane, who is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes of death, but upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy revealed injuries, bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were found in Andy.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the deaths
The alternative explanation given for the deaths of Andy and Ben is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a sudden and unexplained death of infants during their first year of life.

## Step 3: Analyze the findings in Andy's re-examination
The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy are indicative of abuse and are characteristic of smothering according to the prosecution's case.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the findings if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any form of abuse by her. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be due to other causes or could be misinterpreted. However, these findings are generally considered to be indicative of non-accidental injury.

## Step 5: Consider the probability of the findings in the context of SIDS
SIDS is not typically associated with bruises, torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. The presence of such injuries is more commonly linked to non-accidental trauma.

## Step 6: Evaluate the likelihood of the injuries being present if Jane is not guilty
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The injuries found could be due to other factors or misinterpretation. However, the specific injuries mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical of SIDS.

## Step 7: Assess the probability
Since the injuries are indicative of non-accidental trauma and not typical of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), the likelihood of these specific injuries being present due to other, non-abuse related causes is low.

## Step 8: Determine the probability judgment
The probability that Andy would have these injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is not guilty is considered low because these are not typical findings in SIDS or natural deaths. However, it's also possible that there could be other explanations or that the interpretation of these findings could be subject to some debate.

## Step 9: Quantify the probability
Given that the injuries are not characteristic of SIDS and are more indicative of non-accidental injury, if we assume Jane is not guilty, the probability of these injuries being present by chance or due to another cause is low.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings, given that Jane is presumed not to have smothered Andy.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons such as accidental injury, handling by medical professionals, or post-mortem changes. In infants, bruises are uncommon and often raise suspicion of non-accidental injury. However, they can also occur accidentally or during resuscitation attempts.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum (the piece of tissue that connects the tongue or lips to the gum) is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it can be caused by a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible, though less common, for such an injury to occur accidentally.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental injury (such as smothering or other forms of trauma), or other medical conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben might be due to other causes, such as SIDS or other medical conditions. 

- **SIDS**: By definition, SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when no other cause of death can be found after thorough investigation and autopsy. SIDS doesn't typically present with significant pathological findings like bruises, torn frenulum, or blood in the lung.

However, some of these findings can be incidental or related to other conditions or interventions (like resuscitation efforts).

To determine the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider:

1. The possibility that these findings could be related to other causes or be incidental.
2. The likelihood that Andy's death was due to a cause other than smothering, such as SIDS or another medical condition.

While SIDS is a possible alternative explanation for Andy's death, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not typical for SIDS. If these findings are not due to smothering by Jane, they might be due to other, less likely scenarios (e.g., another form of non-accidental injury by someone else, accidental injury, or a rare medical condition).

However, given that these findings are indicative of possible abuse or non-accidental injury, and assuming Jane's innocence, one must consider alternative explanations and the likelihood of such findings occurring coincidentally or due to other factors.

The probability that these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are present in Andy if Jane is not guilty involves assessing the likelihood of alternative explanations for these findings and the deaths.

Given the information and the context that these findings are not typical for SIDS, we can reason that if Jane is not guilty, the presence of these specific findings is relatively unlikely unless there is an alternative explanation for them (e.g., other forms of non-accidental injury or rare medical conditions).

Let's assign a probability judgment based on this analysis.

**20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes of death, but upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy showed signs of injury, Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Analyze the findings in the context of SIDS and smothering
The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of abuse and are characteristic of smothering according to the prosecution's case. However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes such as SIDS.

## Step 3: Consider the likelihood of the injuries if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben would be attributed to other causes, potentially SIDS. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would then need to be explained by other factors or considered as potentially misinterpreted or unrelated to smothering.

## Step 4: Evaluate the probability of the observed injuries in SIDS cases
SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death in infants, with no clear mechanism or cause identified. While SIDS is not typically associated with the specific injuries found in Andy, it's crucial to understand that SIDS cases are, by definition, unexplained. Some infants who die from SIDS may have minor injuries or marks that could be misinterpreted.

## Step 5: Assess the likelihood of the injuries if Andy died of SIDS
Research indicates that some infants who die from SIDS may have minor injuries or marks. However, significant injuries like a torn frenulum are not typical of SIDS and are more commonly associated with trauma.

## Step 6: Consider expert opinions and studies on SIDS and infant injuries
Studies have shown that minor injuries can be found in SIDS cases, but significant injuries are less common. The presence of a torn frenulum, for example, is often considered indicative of significant trauma.

## Step 7: Estimate the probability based on the assumption that Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of finding significant injuries like those described (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) would be low because these are not characteristic of SIDS. However, it's acknowledged that some SIDS cases may have minor or misinterpreted signs of injury.

## Step 8: Determine the probability
Given that the injuries found are not typical for SIDS and are more associated with trauma, if Andy died of SIDS (implying Jane is not guilty), the probability of these specific injuries being present would be low.

## Step 9: Quantify the probability
The exact probability can vary based on the specifics of SIDS cases and the interpretation of the injuries. However, given that significant trauma (like a torn frenulum) is not characteristic of SIDS, we must consider how often such findings are reported in SIDS cases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination of his autopsy photographs.
The re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering according to the prosecution.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for Andy's death, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. It is more common among boys than girls.

## Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of the findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in the context of SIDS versus smothering.
If Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death could be attributed to SIDS. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS.

## Step 4: Assess the probability of these injuries being present if Andy's death was due to SIDS.
SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature, and the presence of significant injuries like those described is not typical for SIDS. However, it's known that some infants who die from SIDS may have minor injuries or marks that could be misinterpreted.

## Step 5: Consider the specific injuries mentioned and their likelihood in a SIDS death.
- Bruises to the arms and legs could potentially occur accidentally.
- A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it typically requires significant force (like a blow to the mouth) to occur.
- Blood in the lung is not a typical finding in SIDS and suggests significant pathology or trauma.

## Step 6: Assess the overall likelihood of these findings occurring in a case of SIDS.
Given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and the presence of significant injuries is not characteristic, the likelihood of these specific findings (especially a torn frenulum and blood in the lung) in a true SIDS case is low.

## Step 7: Consider that if Jane is not guilty, Andy's death was likely due to SIDS or another natural cause, and evaluate the probability of the observed injuries under this assumption.
The injuries described are not typical for SIDS, suggesting that if Andy died of SIDS, the probability of observing these specific injuries is low.

## Step 8: Provide a probability judgment based on the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
Given the information and the nature of the injuries, it is unlikely that Andy's death was SIDS with the described injuries. However, quantifying this requires understanding that SIDS does not typically present with such injuries.

## Step 9: Finalize the probability judgment.
The presence of significant injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in a child who died suddenly is highly suggestive of non-accidental injury. Thus, if Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse), the likelihood of these specific findings is low because they are not characteristic of SIDS.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur due to various reasons not necessarily related to abuse, such as accidental injury. However, the presence of bruises in a non-mobile infant (11 weeks old) is unusual and warrants careful consideration.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if there's a history that doesn't align with the injury. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common in very young infants who are not yet mobile.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding could be indicative of several conditions, including infection or injury. In the context of an infant, it could be related to a variety of factors, not all of which are related to abuse.

If Jane is not guilty, an alternative explanation for the deaths and the findings could be SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. The key question is whether the specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are consistent with an innocent explanation.

SIDS is generally considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion, made when thorough investigation and autopsy do not reveal a cause of death. Some research and controversy exist around whether certain autopsy findings can be associated with SIDS or if they are more indicative of other causes.

The specific autopsy findings mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical characteristics associated with SIDS. SIDS is not usually associated with significant trauma or evidence of violent death.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the autopsy findings are accurate, there are a couple of possible interpretations:
- The findings might not be related to smothering or abuse but could be due to other causes or misinterpretation.
- Alternatively, if the findings are taken as indicative of smothering or significant trauma, it raises questions about the cause.

However, the probability of these specific findings occurring in the context of SIDS or another natural cause, assuming Jane is not guilty, is low because these findings suggest trauma.

The likelihood that these findings occur in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because the described autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS and suggest possible trauma.

**20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about Andy's death and the findings from the re-examination of his autopsy photographs.
The re-examination found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy. These findings are associated with abuse and are characteristic of smothering.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for Andy's death, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of infants during their first year of life. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) and SIDS or smothering.
The presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are typically indicative of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS. SIDS, by definition, is unexplained and not associated with such specific traumatic injuries.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, implying Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause.
If Jane is not guilty, it means Andy's death was not due to smothering or abuse. The injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are not typical for SIDS. However, it's crucial to understand that the presence of these injuries suggests a different cause of death.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability of the observed injuries in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.
Since the injuries are indicative of non-accidental trauma, their presence is not expected in cases of SIDS. The initial post-mortem suggested natural causes, but the re-examination findings contradict this if they are taken as evidence of smothering or abuse.

## Step 6: Consider the probability that Andy had such injuries if he died of SIDS or a similar natural cause.
Given that SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death, the presence of significant injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would not be expected. These findings suggest that if Andy died of SIDS, it's coincidentally associated with these injuries, which is highly unlikely because SIDS does not involve such trauma.

## Step 7: Quantify the likelihood based on the assumption that Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or a natural cause, the probability of him having bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would be very low because these are not characteristic of SIDS.

## Step 8: Provide a probability judgment.
The exact probability is difficult to quantify without specific data on the frequency of such injuries in SIDS cases. However, given that these injuries are indicative of non-accidental trauma, their occurrence in a case presumed to be SIDS (if Jane is not guilty) is unlikely.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings and their relevance to the context of SIDS or other non-inflicted causes.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can be indicative of non-accidental injury, but it can also occur due to accidental trauma or be misinterpreted from post-mortem changes or lividity (settling of blood after death). In the context of SIDS, some bruising or marks might be misattributed or represent post-mortem changes.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often considered a sign of non-accidental injury, as it typically results from a direct blow to the mouth. However, it's also possible, though less common, for this injury to occur accidentally.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with a variety of conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or could be related to attempts at resuscitation.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. The findings in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury. However, it's crucial to understand that these signs, while suspicious, are not exclusively diagnostic of smothering or abuse.

For SIDS, by definition, the cause of death remains unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. Some of the findings in Andy could potentially be misinterpreted or represent rare or atypical presentations of other conditions.

However, the presence of a torn frenulum is particularly concerning for non-accidental injury. While not all signs individually point unequivocally to abuse, together they raise significant concerns.

To quantify the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty (i.e., if the deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause), we need to consider how often such signs occur in the context of SIDS or other non-suspicious deaths.

The literature suggests that certain injuries, like a torn frenulum, are rare in SIDS deaths. In general, the constellation of findings in Andy's case (bruising, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not typical for SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that these specific findings would be present in Andy due to SIDS or another non-suspicious cause.

**Probability Judgment: 5**
To address this question, we need to consider the given information and the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty of smothering him.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural cause, given that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes.

The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung upon re-examination are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI) or abuse. However, the presence of these findings doesn't necessarily prove smothering or murder. They suggest that there could have been some form of trauma or abuse.

However, the question is asking us to consider the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, implying we're looking at a scenario where Andy's death is not due to smothering or murder by Jane.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur in infants due to various reasons, not necessarily due to abuse. However, in infants as young as 11 weeks, significant bruising is unusual and typically raises concerns about NAI.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, which is a significant indicator of NAI.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This can be associated with various conditions, including infection, but in the context of other injuries, it might suggest trauma.

If Jane is not guilty of smothering or murdering Andy, the presence of these injuries doesn't fit with a straightforward SIDS diagnosis or a completely natural death without any underlying condition that could cause such injuries.

However, it's also known that some infants who die from SIDS or other natural causes might have minor injuries or marks that are coincidental or due to attempts at resuscitation. The key here is understanding that the presence of these specific injuries (especially a torn frenulum) in an infant is generally considered to be a significant red flag for NAI.

Given that Jane is not guilty implies we're looking at a scenario where these findings need to be explained by other means. While it's possible for an infant to have some of these findings coincidentally (e.g., due to medical conditions or accidental injury), the combination of these specific injuries is highly unusual in the context of a natural death like SIDS.

To directly answer the question: if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes (not smothering or murder by Jane) is considered low, given the implication of NAI associated with these findings.

The probability judgment is: 5
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

Hypoxic damage (damage due to lack of oxygen) and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be indicative of smothering or other forms of asphyxia, which could be consistent with Jane being guilty. However, these findings can also be associated with other medical conditions or accidental causes.

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations for these findings that do not involve her direct action (like smothering). There are medical conditions that can cause hypoxic damage or hemorrhages, such as severe infections, congenital conditions, or accidental asphyxia not related to Jane's actions.

However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) described is highly suggestive of asphyxial injury, which is a strong indicator of smothering or another form of asphyxia. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that these findings would need to be explained by other means, such as an accidental cause or a medical condition that mimics the effects of asphyxia.

While it's not impossible for these findings to occur without Jane being guilty (e.g., due to a rare medical condition or an accident), the described pattern is very specific and typically associated with asphyxial trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) occurring due to other causes is considered relatively low, given the strong association of these findings with asphyxial injury.

The probability judgment is: 10
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the medical evidence and the implications of Jane's innocence.

The allegation by the doctor that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and understanding of how hypoxic damage typically progresses.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not cause the hypoxic damage or smother Ben. However, the question is not directly about Jane's actions but about the timing of the hypoxic damage relative to Ben's death.

The doctor's statement implies a specific timeline for when the hypoxic damage occurred. If Jane is not guilty, the critical issue is whether the hypoxic damage could have occurred due to other causes or circumstances not related to Jane's actions, within the timeframe suggested by the doctor.

Given that the medical evidence (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) points towards an asphyxial event, and assuming the doctor's assessment of the timing is correct, if Jane is not guilty, it suggests that someone or something else caused the hypoxic damage within the specified timeframe.

The probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on the likelihood of another cause or person being responsible for this damage within that timeframe.

Since the medical evidence is used to infer the timing and cause of the damage, and if we assume Jane's innocence, we are left to consider other potential causes or explanations. However, the doctor's statement directly ties the timing of the hypoxic damage to the events leading to Ben's death.

Therefore, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, still largely depends on accepting the medical evidence and its interpretation. 

The probability judgment is: 20
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the nature of these similarities and how likely they are to occur by chance or due to other factors.

The similarities mentioned are:
1. Both babies were about the same age when they died.
2. They both died at a similar time of day.
3. They both died after just being fed.
4. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where both deaths are not due to her actions (e.g., SIDS or other natural causes).

1. **Same age at death**: It's not uncommon for siblings to be close in age, and infant mortality can occur at various ages within the first year. The likelihood of two siblings dying at roughly the same age could be considered relatively low but is influenced by various factors, including the age gap between them and the underlying causes of death.

2. **Similar time of day and after being fed**: SIDS can occur at any time and has been observed to sometimes cluster around certain times of the day or night. Feeding is a common activity for infants, and deaths occurring after feeding could be coincidental, especially if both deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause.

3. **Found unconscious by Jane when alone with them**: This circumstance is more related to the caregiving arrangement and the fact that Jane was the primary caregiver. It's plausible that as the primary caregiver, Jane would be the one to discover both infants unresponsive.

If both deaths are due to SIDS or other natural causes (Jane not being guilty), the similarities could be considered coincidental. However, some of these similarities are more likely to occur by chance or due to the circumstances of infant care (e.g., being found by Jane because she was the caregiver).

The probability that these similarities occur by chance if Jane is not guilty involves considering the likelihood of these events happening independently. While some factors (like being found by Jane) are more circumstantial, others (like dying at a similar age or time of day) could be considered in the context of the overall incidence of SIDS or infant mortality.

The probability judgment is: 20

To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplainable nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries found in Ben, is not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when no other cause of death is found after thorough investigation.

However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering. The findings of hypoxic damage, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages are not typical for SIDS and usually suggest some form of trauma or asphyxiation. 

The critical question here is whether, in the context of SIDS or a similar natural cause, it's plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. 

If we are to assume Jane's innocence and thus potentially attribute the deaths to SIDS or a similar condition, the presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic brain damage, rib injuries, and other hemorrhages is unusual. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with such findings.

However, there is some evidence to suggest that certain infants who die of SIDS may have experienced some level of hypoxia or stress prior to death, though this is not the same as the significant traumatic or asphyxial injuries described.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage being "a matter of hours before death" may not directly correlate with the typical understanding of SIDS. The described autopsy findings for Ben are more suggestive of an asphyxial event or trauma rather than SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider SIDS or a similar natural cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death being directly related to the cause of death under SIDS is low, primarily because the autopsy findings are not typical for SIDS.

The probability judgment is: 20
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if these findings can be attributed to a cause other than smothering or violent trauma, such as SIDS or another natural cause.

The described autopsy findings (hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are typically associated with asphyxiation or significant trauma. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis made when other causes of death are ruled out, and it is not typically characterized by such significant pathological findings.

While SIDS can sometimes be associated with minor pathological changes, the extent of the findings in Ben's case (hypoxic damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, and hemorrhages) is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis. Some studies suggest that certain infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly may have some evidence of prior stress or hypoxia, but the presence of significant hemorrhages and other traumatic injuries is unusual.

If Jane is not guilty, attributing these specific findings to a natural cause like SIDS becomes challenging due to the nature and extent of the injuries. It's possible that some other, less common natural condition could potentially result in similar findings, but this would be exceptional.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages being due to a natural cause is low, primarily because these findings are more suggestive of trauma or asphyxiation.

The probability judgment is: 10
The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's re-examined autopsy are indicative of significant trauma or abuse. A torn frenulum is often associated with a traumatic injury, such as a blow to the mouth, and blood in the lung can be indicative of asphyxiation or significant trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of her children were not due to her actions, and thus, the injuries found in Andy should be explainable by other means. However, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical findings for SIDS or other natural causes of infant death.

Some of these findings could potentially be attributed to accidental injury or other medical conditions, but the combination of these specific injuries (especially a torn frenulum and blood in the lung) is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, attributing these findings to a non-suspicious cause becomes challenging. There might be alternative explanations for some of the findings, but collectively, they are highly unusual for a natural death or SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings occurring without any foul play is low.

The probability judgment is: 5
If Jane is not guilty, the deaths of her two sons, Andy and Ben, would likely be attributed to natural causes or accidents. The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day they died after being fed, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could be considered coincidental if Jane is not guilty.

SIDS, the proposed alternative explanation, is known to occur more frequently in certain circumstances and at certain ages (typically within the first year, with a peak around 2-4 months). Both babies dying at around the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks) could be seen as a coincidence given that SIDS can occur within a range of ages.

However, the combination of several specific similarities (age at death, time of day, recent feeding, and being found by Jane while alone with them) might initially seem unlikely to occur by chance. But, upon closer inspection, some of these factors are not entirely independent. For instance, the fact that both were infants and died suddenly might make it more plausible that they died under somewhat similar circumstances (e.g., time relative to feeding).

Despite these similarities, if one assumes that the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause and not related to Jane's actions, the likelihood of these similarities occurring is not as low as it might initially seem. The age and the circumstance of being found by Jane while alone could be attributed to the natural circumstances of infant care (e.g., being cared for by the primary caregiver).

Therefore, while the similarities are striking, attributing them to coincidence under the assumption that Jane is not guilty is more plausible than it initially seems, especially given the context that both incidents involve infant deaths, which can sometimes occur under similar circumstances due to their dependency on caregivers and the nature of their vulnerability.

To solve this, let's analyze the given information step by step, considering the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, which implies that the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane.

1. **Understanding SIDS**: SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant under one year of age. The exact cause is unknown, but there are identified risk factors.

2. **Frequency and Demographics of SIDS**: It's given that SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 infants in the UK and is more common among boys.

3. **Injuries Found in Andy**: The re-examination revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are taken as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering in the context of the case against Jane.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood of Injuries if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries might not be due to her actions (i.e., smothering). We need to consider alternative explanations for these injuries.

   - **Bruises to Arms and Legs**: These could result from various causes, not necessarily abuse. Infants can suffer bruises from accidents or even from medical procedures.
   
   - **Torn Frenulum**: This is often associated with blunt trauma to the mouth, which could be accidental or non-accidental.
   
   - **Blood in the Lung**: This could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection or trauma.

5. **Relating the Injuries to SIDS**: The question then becomes whether these findings are consistent with SIDS or if they necessarily imply foul play. SIDS is diagnosed when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

6. **Probability Assessment**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the injuries found would need to be explained by other means.

The key here is understanding that the presence of these injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) is not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes are ruled out. The presence of these injuries suggests that the death might not be a straightforward SIDS case, as they indicate possible trauma.

However, it's also possible for infants to suffer from accidental injuries or conditions that might cause some of these findings. The crucial aspect is determining the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring in the context of SIDS or another natural cause.

Given that SIDS is not typically associated with significant trauma or the specific injuries described, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present due to other, non-abusive causes is still relatively low. However, it's not zero, as accidents or undiagnosed medical conditions could potentially cause some of these findings.

**Quantifying this is challenging without specific data on the incidence of such injuries in SIDS cases or in infants generally.**

Given the above considerations and the fact that these injuries are not characteristic of SIDS but could potentially occur through other means, the probability that Andy would have these injuries if Jane is not guilty (and thus the death was not due to smothering) is difficult to quantify directly from the given information.

However, acknowledging that these injuries are not typical for SIDS and assuming they are not due to Jane's actions if she is not guilty, we must consider alternative, less common explanations.

**Probability Judgment: 5**

This reflects a low probability, acknowledging that while the injuries are not typical for SIDS, there could be other, less common explanations if Jane is not guilty. However, the exact probability depends on various factors not fully detailed here, such as the incidence of similar injuries in SIDS cases or accidental injuries in infants. 

**5**
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings. 

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of accidental injury or non-accidental injury (abuse). In the context of SIDS or other natural causes, minor bruises could potentially occur accidentally, but significant or multiple bruises are less likely to be accidental in a very young infant with limited mobility.

2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, as it typically results from a significant force being applied to the mouth area, such as a blow or forced feeding. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with smothering or other forms of asphyxia but can also be seen in cases of natural disease or other conditions.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries could be due to natural causes or accidents rather than intentional harm. The presence of these specific injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy, given that Jane is not guilty, would be unusual if they were supposed to be indicative of smothering or abuse.

However, it's also possible that these findings could be misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause that was not identified. 

The key issue here is that the original autopsy concluded natural causes, and it was only upon re-examination, potentially with a bias towards finding evidence of smothering given the second child's autopsy results, that these injuries were noted.

Given that Jane is not guilty, we are working under the assumption that the deaths were not due to smothering or abuse. The likelihood of these specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) being present due to other causes (accidental injury, misinterpretation, etc.) is low because they are generally considered indicative of significant trauma.

However, without specific evidence or a detailed medical analysis that these findings are definitely not related to SIDS or another natural cause, we must consider the general improbability of such significant injuries being present without a clear history of accidental trauma.

The probability that these findings are present in Andy if Jane is not guilty involves assessing the likelihood that these are either misinterpreted or due to an accidental cause not related to her actions.

Given the information and the need to think about alternative explanations for these injuries if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood is considered to be low.

The probability judgment is: 20
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the medical evidence and the implications of Jane's innocence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by her. Hypoxic damage to the brain can result from various causes, including but not limited to, asphyxia or smothering.

The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a medical finding that is based on the interpretation of the autopsy results. If Jane is not guilty, the cause of the hypoxic damage would need to be attributed to other factors.

1. **Alternative Causes**: There could be other medical or accidental reasons for the hypoxic damage. For instance, an underlying medical condition, an accidental asphyxia, or an undetermined cause related to SIDS could be considered.

2. **Medical Interpretation**: The timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is a medical interpretation. If this interpretation is based on sound medical evidence and understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxic brain damage, then the timing could be plausible regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence.

However, the critical question is whether the hypoxic damage's timing is directly linked to Jane's actions or if it could have occurred due to other reasons. If Jane is not guilty, we must consider that the hypoxic damage could have resulted from an accidental or natural cause.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death does not directly depend on Jane's guilt or innocence but rather on the medical evidence and its interpretation. 

Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty, is still relatively high because it is more about the medical interpretation of the evidence rather than Jane's actions.

The probability judgment is: 70
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings that do not involve intentional harm by Jane.

1. **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This can result from various causes, including asphyxia or other conditions that lead to oxygen deprivation. If Jane is not guilty, other accidental or natural causes for the hypoxic damage need to be considered.

2. **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are often associated with trauma or asphyxia. However, they can also occur due to other medical conditions or birth-related trauma, though the latter is less likely given Ben's age.

If Jane is not guilty, we are looking for alternative explanations that could result in these findings. 

- **Accidental asphyxia or other medical conditions**: These could potentially cause hypoxic damage and haemorrhages. However, the specific pattern of injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is more typically associated with asphyxia or smothering.

- **SIDS or other natural causes**: While SIDS is a consideration for infant deaths, the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis.

Given that Jane is not guilty implies that the cause of Ben's death was not due to her intentional actions. The likelihood of these specific findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) occurring due to other, non-intentional causes is lower because they are strongly indicative of asphyxia or trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings is considered low because they are more typically associated with non-accidental injury.

The probability judgment is: 10
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these similarities could occur by chance or due to other factors unrelated to Jane's actions.

1. **Age at death**: Both babies being about the same age could be coincidental, given that they are siblings and might have similar routines or vulnerabilities at similar ages.

2. **Time of day and recent feeding**: Infants are often fed and monitored around the same times of the day, and it's not uncommon for incidents or observations to occur around feeding times.

3. **Found unconscious by Jane when alone with them**: This aspect is more specific and relates to the circumstances under which Jane was alone with the babies.

If Jane is not guilty, the similarities could be attributed to a combination of coincidence, the natural routines and vulnerabilities associated with infant care, and the fact that both incidents involved the same caregiver (Jane).

The probability of these similarities occurring by chance is not extremely low because some factors (like age and time of day relative to feeding) could be considered somewhat common or related to normal infant care routines. However, the cumulative effect of these similarities, especially the fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious, contributes to a perception of improbability.

To quantify this, let's consider:
- The probability that both are around the same age when they die might not be extremely low given they are siblings.
- The similarity in the time of day and the circumstance of being recently fed could be moderately likely due to routine.
- The fact that Jane was alone with both when they were found unconscious is a significant factor but not necessarily highly improbable given she was their primary caregiver.

Given these considerations, while the exact probability is difficult to quantify without more specific context or statistical data, the occurrence of these similarities by chance, if Jane is not guilty, is not extremely high.

To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of accidental injury or non-accidental injury (abuse). If Jane is not guilty, the bruises could be accidental.

2. **Torn frenulum**: This is often considered a sign of non-accidental injury, particularly in the context of a child who is not yet mobile. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common.

3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding can be associated with various conditions, including infection, accidental injury, or non-accidental injury (such as smothering or other forms of trauma).

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries to Andy could be due to other causes, such as SIDS or accidental injuries. SIDS is not typically associated with significant external or internal injuries like those described. However, it's crucial to differentiate between the cause of death (which could potentially be SIDS if we were not considering the suspicious injuries) and the presence of injuries that are not typical for SIDS.

The injuries described (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are not typical for SIDS. If Jane is not guilty, we would have to consider that these injuries might have been misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause, though the latter is less likely given the nature of the injuries.

The likelihood of these specific injuries occurring in the context of a SIDS death or an accidental death (without any negligence or intent by Jane) is low because such injuries are generally associated with some form of trauma.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming the injuries were not due to her actions, we are left to consider how likely these injuries are under other scenarios. The scenario that comes closest is an accidental or unexplained cause. However, the presence of multiple types of injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is highly unusual for SIDS or typical accidental injuries in a non-mobile infant.

Given this, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that Andy would still have these specific injuries is relatively low because they are indicative of some form of trauma or non-accidental injury.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the context of the case and the given information
The case involves Jane, who is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The initial autopsy on Andy suggested natural causes of death, but upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy showed signs of injury, Andy's autopsy photographs revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 2: Analyze the findings related to Andy's death
The findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are indicative of potential abuse. A torn frenulum is often associated with physical abuse, as it can be caused by a blow to the mouth. Bruises on the arms and legs, and blood in the lung, can also be indicative of trauma.

## Step 3: Consider the alternative explanation - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion for sudden and unexplained infant deaths. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK. While SIDS can occur, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is not typical for SIDS, as SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanatory cause for death upon thorough investigation.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of the findings if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any intentional act by her. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy could still occur due to accidental trauma or other non-intentional causes. However, these findings are not characteristic of SIDS.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability of such injuries in a SIDS context
SIDS deaths are not typically associated with significant external or internal injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, or blood in the lung. The presence of these injuries suggests that the death may not be solely attributed to SIDS.

## Step 6: Consider the probability of accidental injuries that could be misinterpreted
While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental injuries, the combination of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is concerning for non-accidental injury.

## Step 7: Assess the likelihood of these findings occurring naturally or accidentally in the context of SIDS
Given that SIDS is a diagnosis that implies a lack of other explanatory causes for death, the presence of significant injuries makes it less likely that Andy's death was due to SIDS alone.

## Step 8: Consider the overall context to estimate the probability
If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of finding such injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) would be low because these are not characteristic of SIDS. However, it's also possible that these could be misinterpreted or that there was an accidental cause.

## Step 9: Estimate the probability based on the information given
The probability that Andy would have such injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is not guilty (implying his death was not due to smothering or her intentional act) is related to how likely these injuries are to occur by chance or accident in the context of an infant death attributed to SIDS or other natural causes.

## Step 10: Provide a final probability judgment
Given that the presence of such injuries is not typical for SIDS and suggests potential non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present in Andy is relatively low because they do not align with the expectation of SIDS or natural causes. However, quantifying this requires understanding that these injuries are not characteristic of SIDS, suggesting an alternative explanation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and possible explanations for these findings.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any form of intentional harm by her. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

1. **Understanding the findings**: 
   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of trauma. However, infants can sometimes get bruised due to accidental injuries or even during medical procedures or handling.
   - **Torn frenulum**: This is often considered a sign of potential abuse as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible for a torn frenulum to occur accidentally, though this is less common.
   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of significant trauma or other serious conditions.

2. **Relating the findings to SIDS or accidental causes**:
   - SIDS is diagnosed when the death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung typically rules out SIDS as these findings suggest that the death might not be entirely unexplained.

3. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it means we are looking at the scenario where the injuries and death are either due to SIDS or some other accidental or natural cause.
   - The specific injuries mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical of SIDS. SIDS deaths are not usually associated with such significant traumatic findings.
   - However, it is theoretically possible for an infant to die of SIDS and still have some injuries or signs that could be misinterpreted. The key here is whether these findings are consistent with an accidental or SIDS-related death.

4. **Probability Judgment**:
Given that the presence of these injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not typical for SIDS and generally indicates some form of trauma or significant event, if Jane is not guilty (implying no intentional harm), the likelihood of these specific findings being present due to other (non-intentional harm) causes is low.

The probability judgment is: 5
To assess the likelihood of the similarities between the incidents involving Andy and Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of these similarities.

The similarities mentioned are:
1. Both babies were about the same age when they died.
2. They both died at a similar time of day.
3. They both died after just being fed.
4. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her intentional actions (e.g., smothering). In this case, we're considering whether these similarities could occur by coincidence or due to other factors.

1. **Age at death**: SIDS can occur at any age during the first year, but it peaks between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which is not uncommon for SIDS cases. The similarity in age could be coincidental given that both were infants and within the age range susceptible to SIDS.

2. **Time of day and feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time. However, there isn't a well-established correlation between SIDS and the time of day relative to feeding. Some research suggests that SIDS might be more common during certain periods, such as the early morning hours, but these patterns are not strongly tied to feeding times.

3. **Being found unconscious by Jane when alone**: This circumstance is more related to the household dynamics and Jane's role as the primary caregiver rather than the cause of death. It's plausible that as the primary caregiver, Jane would be the one to discover both children unresponsive.

To assess the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty, we consider that:
- The age similarity could be somewhat expected given the age range for SIDS.
- The time of day and relation to feeding might be less directly correlated but could still occur by coincidence.
- Being alone with the children is a circumstance related to caregiving responsibilities.

However, the combination of these specific similarities, while not impossible, becomes less likely under the assumption of natural or accidental deaths (like SIDS), as SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained and the circumstances around them can vary widely.

The probability judgment is: 20
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the medical evidence and the implications of Jane's innocence.

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it suggests that Ben experienced a period of insufficient oxygenation before death.

2. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death implies that there was a significant event or period of hypoxia relatively close to the time of death.

3. **Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not intentionally cause harm or smother Ben. In this scenario, any hypoxic damage would be due to other, non-intentional causes.

4. **Assessing Likelihood**: 
   - If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typical. SIDS deaths are sudden and unexpected, and while there can be some pathological findings, significant hypoxic damage hours before death is not characteristic of SIDS.
   - Other natural or accidental causes could potentially result in hypoxic damage, but the timing and context would be crucial in determining the likelihood.

Given that significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of infant death, if Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering or causing the hypoxic damage intentionally), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred due to natural causes or accident a matter of hours before death is relatively low.

The probability judgment is: 10
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the nature of these findings and their association with smothering or other violent trauma.

1. **Understanding the Findings**: 
   - Hypoxic damage to the brain indicates a lack of oxygen, which can be caused by various factors including smothering.
   - Hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids can be associated with increased pressure or trauma, which can also be seen in cases of smothering or other forms of asphyxia.

2. **Association with Smothering or Violent Trauma**: These findings are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma. Smothering can cause hypoxic damage due to the obstruction of airflow, and the struggle or pressure applied during smothering can potentially lead to hemorrhages.

3. **Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother or cause violent trauma to Ben.

4. **Alternative Explanations**: 
   - SIDS or other natural causes of death typically do not present with significant hypoxic damage or hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids as primary findings. 
   - Accidental causes could potentially lead to some of these findings, but they would be unusual and not typically characteristic of SIDS.

5. **Assessing Likelihood**: 
   - Given that these findings are more characteristic of non-accidental injury (like smothering) rather than SIDS or other natural causes, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings is relatively low.

The presence of these specific injuries (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) is more indicative of a non-natural cause of death. Thus, if Jane is not guilty, it is less likely to observe these findings.

## Step 1: Understand the given information
The problem presents a case where Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The background includes the circumstances of their deaths and the findings from autopsies. It's also mentioned that an alternative explanation for their deaths could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

## Step 2: Analyze the autopsy findings for both children
For Ben, the autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Further investigation on Andy based on autopsy photographs found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

## Step 3: Understand the condition of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain
Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor alleged that this damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death.

## Step 4: Consider the implications of Jane being NOT GUILTY
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of intentional act by Jane. In this context, SIDS becomes a relevant consideration.

## Step 5: Relate SIDS to the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain
SIDS is characterized by a sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The pathophysiology of SIDS is not fully understood, but it is known that it can involve episodes of hypoxia or apnea (pauses in breathing) before death.

## Step 6: Assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death if Jane is not guilty
If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage could still occur due to underlying conditions or events leading to SIDS. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) and the nature of the hypoxic damage need to be considered in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.

## Step 7: Evaluate the doctor's allegation in the context of Jane's innocence
The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is significant. If Jane is innocent, the critical question is whether SIDS or another condition could result in hypoxic damage hours before death.

## Step 8: Consider the pathology of SIDS and hypoxic damage
SIDS can involve agonal (pre-death) events that might include hypoxia. However, the specific timing and nature of these events can vary.

## Step 9: Assess the probability based on the given information and context
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause. The occurrence of hypoxic damage hours before death, as alleged, would need to be plausible under such circumstances.

## Step 10: Determine the likelihood
The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty depends on whether such damage can occur in the context of SIDS or other natural causes. While SIDS is associated with unexplained deaths, some research suggests that infants who die from SIDS may have experienced stress or hypoxia before death.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the possible causes of hypoxic damage in infants.

Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it suggests that there was a period where his brain was deprived of sufficient oxygen. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane.

The given autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. If we consider that Jane is not guilty and thus did not smother Ben, we need to consider alternative explanations for the hypoxic damage. 

1. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly cause hypoxic damage in the manner described. However, if Ben's death was due to SIDS, it's not directly related to the timing of hypoxic damage.

2. **Other Accidental or Natural Causes**: There are conditions or events that could lead to hypoxic damage, such as respiratory infections, congenital conditions, or accidental suffocation (not related to Jane's actions).

The statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical assertion based on the autopsy findings. The likelihood of this being true if Jane is not guilty depends on whether there are plausible alternative explanations for Ben's condition.

If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage might still be explained by events immediately preceding his death. 

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, we're assessing the likelihood that the medical assertion about the timing of hypoxic damage is correct regardless of the cause of death.

The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise and the condition found during the autopsy. The guilt or innocence of Jane does not directly influence the timing of when the hypoxic damage occurred; it's more related to the cause.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a cause other than smothering by Jane, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is still dependent on the medical evidence and its interpretation.

The medical evidence suggests that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. Whether Jane is guilty or not, the medical fact remains. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the damage is a result of some other cause, it is still plausible that it occurred a matter of hours before death.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and the given information.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural cause rather than smothering by Jane. The pathologist's findings on Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were interpreted as indicative of smothering. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact mechanism of SIDS is unknown, research has identified certain risk factors and correlations. However, the presence of hypoxic damage, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and other findings in Ben's autopsy are not typical characteristics used to define SIDS.

The assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar condition, the timing of the hypoxic damage would be less relevant to Jane's actions (since she is presumed not to have caused it).

However, the critical issue here is whether the hypoxic damage's timing (a matter of hours before death) is consistent with a scenario where Jane is not guilty. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the hypoxic damage might not be directly related to Jane's actions. 

The question then becomes about the likelihood of the medical expert's assertion being correct under the assumption that Jane is not guilty. 

If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS or a similar natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing (hours before death) may not directly implicate Jane. However, the specific timing of hypoxic damage is a medical determination based on the nature of the injury or condition.

SIDS does not typically involve a clear agonal period (the period of struggle or distress before death) that results in significant hypoxic damage detectable upon autopsy. The presence of such damage suggests an event or process leading to hypoxia.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death is still a matter of medical interpretation.

The pathologist's assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on their professional judgment. If we are to consider Jane's innocence and the possibility that the death was due to a natural cause, we must consider that the medical findings (like hypoxic damage) could be interpreted differently or have different implications.

However, the fact that hypoxic damage was found suggests there was some form of distress or issue before death. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming a natural cause, one might still need to reconcile the presence and timing of such damage with the circumstances.

Therefore, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, hinges on the interpretation of the medical evidence in the context of possible natural causes of death.

Given the complexity of determining the cause and timing of hypoxic damage and considering Jane's innocence, the probability judgment will be based on the plausibility of the medical expert's assertion under the assumption of Jane's innocence.

**85**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of smothering her two sons, Andy and Ben. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of both children, which suggested injuries that could be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to damage caused by a lack of oxygen.

3. **Implication of Hypoxic Damage**: The presence of hypoxic damage suggests that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen at some point before his death.

4. **Prosecution's Interpretation**: The prosecution alleges that this damage was caused by smothering, implying that Jane caused the hypoxic damage a matter of hours before Ben's death.

5. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense might argue that both deaths could be attributed to SIDS, which is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant.

6. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of abuse by Jane. In this scenario, if we are to consider SIDS or another natural cause as the reason for their deaths, the hypoxic damage found in Ben needs to be explained by an alternative mechanism.

7. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by its unexplained nature. While some SIDS cases might involve findings that could be interpreted as hypoxic damage (since the exact cause of death is not always clear), attributing the specific timing of such damage (e.g., a matter of hours before death) to SIDS is challenging without a clear understanding of the pathophysiology leading to SIDS.

8. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (being a matter of hours before death) as suggested by the prosecution, may not directly correlate with the typical understanding of SIDS. However, it's known that infants can suffer from episodes of hypoxia or apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) that might not necessarily be fatal immediately but could potentially lead to death.

9. **Conclusion**: The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty hinges on whether one believes the death was due to a natural cause or an unexplained event like SIDS. The autopsy findings could be seen as inconsistent with a straightforward SIDS diagnosis due to the presence of specific injuries. However, there is ongoing debate among medical professionals about the interpretation of such findings.

Given the provided context and the complexity of determining the exact cause and timing of hypoxic damage in the context of SIDS or other natural causes, and assuming Jane is not guilty implies looking for alternative explanations.

**Probability Judgment: 40**
To determine the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for the deaths of Andy and Ben, and how they relate to the timing of the hypoxic damage.

1. **Understanding the condition**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen before he died.

2. **Considering SIDS as an alternative explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes of death are ruled out. If Jane is not guilty, then SIDS or another natural cause could be considered as an explanation for the deaths.

3. **Analyzing the timing of hypoxic damage in SIDS or other natural causes**: In cases of SIDS or other natural causes, the process leading to death might not necessarily be instantaneous or occur just hours before death. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, but the pathophysiology can sometimes involve a process that unfolds over a period, though this is not typically quantifiable in hours in the same way that might be suggested by the prosecution's interpretation.

4. **Evaluating the statement in the context of innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of her children could be attributed to SIDS or another medical condition. The presence of hypoxic damage in Ben could be consistent with a severe medical event or condition leading to death.

5. **Assessing the likelihood**: The key issue is whether the hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours before death" is consistent with an innocent explanation. The prosecution's interpretation implies a deliberate act causing the hypoxic damage. An innocent explanation (like SIDS) doesn't directly explain the timing of hypoxic damage in the same causative manner.

However, it's known that some infants who die from SIDS may have some pathological changes indicative of stress or possible asphyxia, though these are generally not as pronounced or attributed to a clear cause as in Ben's case. The medical evidence presented might suggest that Ben suffered an asphyxial event or another severe condition. 

If Jane is not guilty, the deaths are due to natural causes or SIDS. In such cases, attributing the hypoxic damage to a specific timing (like "a matter of hours before death") due to a deliberate act is not applicable. However, if we are to consider the possibility that some natural process or condition could result in hypoxic damage, we are still left with understanding that the specific timing and nature (i.e., a matter of hours) could be subject to interpretation based on the underlying cause.

**The critical point here is the implication that if Jane is not guilty, the medical evidence still indicates some form of asphyxial or hypoxic event leading to Ben's death, but it doesn't necessarily align with the prosecution's narrative of a deliberate act.** 

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane's innocence and attributing the death to a natural cause, hinges on whether such natural causes can result in a similar timeline of injury and death.

**Given the information, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, is relatively low because the scenario provided (hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death) is more directly associated with a traumatic or non-natural causation than with the typical understanding of SIDS or other natural causes.**

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, typically under one year of age. The exact cause or mechanism of SIDS remains unknown, but it is associated with various risk factors. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries found in Ben, is not typically a characteristic used to define or diagnose SIDS, as SIDS is generally diagnosed after excluding other causes of death through autopsy and investigation.

The injuries found in Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, suggest a non-natural cause of death, potentially indicative of smothering or another form of asphyxia. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.

The key issue here is whether the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, alleged to have occurred a matter of hours before death, is consistent with SIDS or another explanation if Jane is not guilty. SIDS is not typically associated with significant pathological findings like hypoxic brain damage that can be timed to a matter of hours before death. Such findings usually suggest an antemortem event or process that led to the hypoxia.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are considering SIDS or another natural/accidental cause for Ben's death, the presence of significant hypoxic brain damage and other injuries is not easily explained by SIDS alone, as SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and does not typically present with such clear evidence of antemortem trauma or hypoxia that can be timed.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death becomes less plausible because SIDS does not typically involve such clear signs of hypoxia or trauma that can be timed.

**Probability judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the given information.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS. The description of SIDS as a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life is crucial. SIDS is known for occurring unexpectedly in apparently healthy babies.

The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that Ben's death might not have been due to smothering or any deliberate act by Jane. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries (like injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) complicates the picture because these are not typical or characteristic findings for SIDS.

SIDS is diagnosed when other causes of death are excluded, and it is not associated with specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage or the other injuries found in Ben. The presence of these findings suggests that Ben's death may not be attributed to SIDS in a straightforward manner.

If we are to assume Jane is not guilty and consider an alternative explanation such as SIDS for Ben's death, we must reconcile this with the autopsy findings. The hypoxic damage, indicative of a lack of oxygen, could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. However, the doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a specific timeline for when the damage occurred.

To evaluate the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether SIDS or another natural cause could result in such damage. SIDS, by definition, involves an unexplained death, and the presence of significant pathological findings like hypoxic brain damage is not characteristic.

The assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical expertise. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation for the death, the timing of the hypoxic damage would need to align with a plausible natural or accidental cause.

However, the detailed autopsy findings and the specific timing of the hypoxic damage as stated by the doctor raise questions about the compatibility of these findings with a diagnosis of SIDS or another natural cause.

Given the information and focusing on the condition that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death hinges on whether there's a plausible alternative explanation that fits the given autopsy results and the scenario of innocence.

The presence of significant injuries and the doctor's assertion about the timing of the hypoxic damage make it challenging to attribute Ben's death to SIDS or a similar natural cause without contradicting the given autopsy findings.

Therefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and considering the provided autopsy findings, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, as per the doctor's allegation, is not directly supported by the hypothesis of innocence and the characteristics of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of Ben, which included hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it suggests that Ben experienced a period of insufficient oxygen supply before death.

3. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

4. **Alternative Explanation (SIDS)**: SIDS is a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, with no clear cause identified after thorough investigation. The frequency and characteristics of SIDS are provided but do not directly explain the specific autopsy findings on Ben.

5. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The key issue is whether the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the timing and cause of the hypoxic damage need to be reconsidered.

6. **Medical Understanding and SIDS**: SIDS deaths are by definition unexplained. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben's autopsy does not align with typical SIDS cases, as SIDS does not usually present with such specific pathological findings indicative of a hypoxic event shortly before death.

7. **Assessing Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and we consider an alternative cause like SIDS, the specific finding of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typical for SIDS. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly explain the hypoxic damage. However, it might be argued that some form of underlying condition or accidental cause (not related to Jane's actions) could potentially be responsible for both the death and the hypoxic damage.

8. **Conclusion**: The assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical evidence. If Jane is not guilty, the cause of this damage and its timing would need to be explained by an alternative mechanism or condition that does not involve Jane's actions. The presence of such damage is not characteristic of SIDS, which is a diagnosis given when other causes are ruled out.

Given that the hypoxic damage is not typically associated with SIDS and indicates a specific pathological process, if Jane is not guilty, it's less likely that the damage occurred as a result of an event related to her actions (since she's not guilty). However, the medical evidence suggests that there was a significant hypoxic event before death, which is not directly explained by SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death being a result of an unexplained or natural cause (not related to Jane's guilt) is still plausible because the medical evidence supports that such damage occurred. The uncertainty lies in its cause.

**Probability Judgment: 50**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The prosecution's case partly relies on the autopsy findings of both children, which suggested injuries indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, hypoxic damage to the brain indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen before he died.

3. **Assessing the Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is significant because it implies a relatively short timeframe in which the damaging event (potentially smothering, according to the prosecution) happened.

4. **Jane's Innocence and SIDS**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature.

5. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing become critical. SIDS is not typically associated with clear signs of hypoxic damage or specific injuries found in Ben's autopsy. However, if we are to assume Jane's innocence and that the death could be due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, we must look at how likely it is for such conditions to cause hypoxic damage hours before death.

6. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is not typically characterized by significant hypoxic damage hours before death because it is a sudden event. However, some research suggests that some infants who die from SIDS may have had episodes of hypoxia or other stressors before death, but these are not usually quantifiable or directly linked to a specific timeframe like "a matter of hours."

7. **Natural Causes and the Timing**: If the cause of death was natural (like SIDS), it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage would be observed and specifically dated to "a matter of hours" before death, as SIDS deaths are typically sudden and not preceded by a prolonged period of hypoxia that would cause detectable brain damage.

8. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty and the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the scenario that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is less plausible because SIDS is characterized by its suddenness. However, the presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries suggests a possible non-natural cause.

Given these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar condition, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death in the context of a natural death. The presence of such damage, as described, is not typical for SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about the case and the condition of Ben's brain.
The problem states that Ben, the second son of Jane and Frank, was found unwell and later pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, with no clear cause. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK.

## Step 3: Analyze the implications of Jane being not guilty on the cause of Ben's death.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. Therefore, the deaths could be attributed to other causes, including SIDS.

## Step 4: Examine the specifics of Ben's autopsy findings and the timing of the hypoxic damage.
The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, which the doctor claimed occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, we need to consider if SIDS or another natural cause could explain Ben's condition.

## Step 5: Consider the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death in the context of SIDS or other natural causes.
SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death. However, the presence of hypoxic damage suggests some form of asphyxia or lack of oxygen. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the condition leading to death might not be directly related to a prolonged period of hypoxia caused by smothering.

## Step 6: Evaluate the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering. The hypoxic damage could still occur due to other reasons such as a natural cause leading to asphyxia or another medical condition. However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) and its relation to the alleged crime (smothering) needs to be assessed in the context of alternative explanations.

## Step 7: Assess the doctor's allegation in light of Jane's innocence.
If Jane is innocent, the doctor's allegation about the timing of the hypoxic damage might not directly relate to her actions. The critical question is whether the hypoxic damage could occur naturally or due to an unforeseen medical condition a matter of hours before death.

## Step 8: Relate the given frequency of SIDS and its characteristics to the likelihood of the hypoxic damage.
SIDS is more common among boys and has an unknown cause. While SIDS itself doesn't directly explain hypoxic damage, the presence of such damage suggests an event or condition leading to asphyxia. However, the condition of Ben (hypoxic damage) doesn't directly align with typical SIDS cases, which are often characterized by a lack of clear cause or warning signs.

## Step 9: Consider the probability based on the information given and the condition that Jane is not guilty.
Given Jane's innocence, if we consider alternative causes for Ben's death, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to natural causes or other non-criminal factors is not directly quantifiable based on the information about SIDS alone.

## Step 10: Make a judgment on the likelihood based on the context provided.
The doctor's statement implies a specific cause (likely smothering) for the hypoxic damage. If Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage's cause and timing need an alternative explanation. The condition could potentially occur due to various medical reasons. However, the problem doesn't provide a direct link between SIDS or other natural causes and the specific timing of hypoxic damage.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, potentially SIDS, given it's mentioned as an alternative explanation.

2. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, as seen in Ben's autopsy, could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. Hypoxic damage typically indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen.

3. **Interpreting Hypoxic Damage Timing**: The allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is significant. In cases of SIDS or natural causes, it's unusual to pinpoint such damage to a specific timeframe before death without other explanatory factors.

4. **Considering Alternative Causes**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming SIDS or a similar natural cause is the reason for Ben's death, the expectation would be that the death was sudden and without a prolonged period of hypoxia that could be timed.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood**: The critical question is whether the hypoxic damage, if occurring a matter of hours before death, aligns with a scenario where Jane is not guilty. SIDS deaths are typically unexpected and without a clear cause or preceding period of observable distress that would lead to significant hypoxic damage hours before death.

Given that SIDS is sudden and unexplained, the presence of significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death might not align well with a typical SIDS death, as it suggests a potentially observable period of distress or issue. However, it's also known that some infants can have underlying vulnerabilities or conditions that might predispose them to SIDS, and the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

The information about SIDS does not directly inform us about the timing of hypoxic damage before death. However, the nature of SIDS as sudden and unexpected makes it less likely that there was a period of significant hypoxia hours before death that was not associated with observable distress or immediate medical emergency.

**Therefore**, if Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS or a similar cause, it is less likely that there was significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before Ben's death, as this suggests a more complex scenario than the sudden nature typically associated with SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, it indicates that Ben experienced a period of low oxygen levels before death.

2. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to SIDS. SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature.

3. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is critical. SIDS, by definition, is sudden and unexpected. The pathophysiology of SIDS is not fully understood, but it is not typically associated with a prolonged period of hypoxia before death that would be diagnosable or observable as significant hypoxic damage.

4. **Analysis**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the expectation is that the death would be sudden and without significant prior distress that would result in diagnosable hypoxic damage hours before death. While SIDS deaths can involve some level of hypoxia, the idea that there was significant hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours before death" is not typically aligned with the sudden nature of SIDS.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**: The condition described (hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death) is less likely to be associated with SIDS if we consider SIDS to be a sudden event without a prolonged preceding period of significant distress or hypoxia.

Given Jane is not guilty, and assuming both deaths were due to SIDS, the likelihood that Ben's hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is not supported by the typical understanding of SIDS. However, it's acknowledged that SIDS is not fully understood, and there can be variations in presentation.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying SIDS), the scenario of hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before Ben's death is less likely because it suggests a process that might not be entirely consistent with the suddenness associated with SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries, initially suggested to the investigators that the death might not be due to natural causes or SIDS, leading to the suspicion of smothering. However, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause.

The condition described for Ben - hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids - is not typical for a straightforward diagnosis of SIDS, as SIDS is generally defined by the absence of a clear cause of death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

However, the presence of certain findings at autopsy does not necessarily preclude a diagnosis related to SIDS or a similar condition if those findings can be explained by other mechanisms or if they are considered to be within the spectrum of possible SIDS-related changes.

The key question is whether the hypoxic damage could occur a matter of hours before death in a scenario where Jane is not guilty. Hypoxic damage (lack of oxygen) can occur due to various reasons, not necessarily due to smothering. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained condition, it's possible that the hypoxic damage could be part of the pathological process leading to death, although the typical understanding of SIDS doesn't usually involve such clear evidence of hypoxia as a preceding event.

However, research and some pathological studies suggest that some infants who die of SIDS may have had preceding hypoxia or stress, though this is still a matter of debate and not conclusively linked to the timing (e.g., "a matter of hours") before death.

Given the context that Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative explanation like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death due to natural causes or a complex pathological process is difficult to quantify directly from the given information. However, if we are to consider SIDS or a similar condition as the cause, the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage as described (and its relation to the cause of death) are not typical characteristics used to define or diagnose SIDS.

Therefore, without more specific medical evidence or expert opinion directly linking such hypoxic damage to a natural or SIDS-related process occurring hours before death, we would be speculating.

However, given the requirement to provide a probability judgment, we can say that if Jane is not guilty and the death is attributed to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, the scenario that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is not directly supported by the typical understanding of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben (and Andy) was not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm caused by Jane. The alternative explanation given is that the deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, however, suggests that his death was not a typical case of SIDS, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

The findings in Ben's autopsy are indicative of a possible non-accidental injury, which raises the suspicion of smothering or another form of abuse. However, we're tasked with evaluating the scenario assuming Jane is not guilty.

If Jane is not guilty, and we are to consider an alternative explanation for Ben's condition, we must examine if SIDS or another natural cause could potentially explain the hypoxic damage. Hypoxic damage typically results from a lack of sufficient oxygen. While SIDS is associated with various risk factors, there isn't a clear-cut mechanism that directly links SIDS to hypoxic damage occurring hours before death in a straightforward manner.

However, some research suggests that certain SIDS cases might involve underlying vulnerabilities or episodes of hypoxia prior to death, though this is still speculative and not conclusively linked to the timing (e.g., "a matter of hours before death") as suggested by the doctor's allegation.

Given that the scenario presumes Jane's innocence, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or a similar unexplained natural cause, the assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" is not directly supported by the typical understanding of SIDS. SIDS cases are, by definition, unexpected and without a clear cause after thorough investigation.

Therefore, if we are to consider that Jane is not guilty and that the condition leading to Ben's death could be related to SIDS or a similar condition, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death as a result of natural causes or SIDS (and not as a result of smothering or other foul play) becomes a complex medical judgment.

The medical evidence presented (hypoxic damage, injuries) is not typical for SIDS, suggesting an underlying issue that might not be directly related to SIDS. Thus, attributing the hypoxic damage to a natural cause or SIDS in the context provided is challenging.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Jane is charged with murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, such as SIDS.

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death is significant because it suggests a timeline for when the cause of the hypoxic damage might have occurred.

3. **Considering SIDS as an Alternative Explanation**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, given when the death of an infant cannot be explained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of risk factors and the age of the infants (both under 3 months) could be consistent with SIDS.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it means we are considering a scenario where the deaths are not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). SIDS is an unexplainable cause of death, and while it doesn't directly explain the specific autopsy findings in Ben (like hypoxic damage), some of these findings could potentially be misinterpreted or consistent with other natural causes or agonal (dying) processes.

5. **Medical and Forensic Considerations**: The interpretation of hypoxic damage and its timing is a medical and forensic matter. If Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage might still occur as part of the dying process, not necessarily as a result of a violent act like smothering.

6. **Likelihood Assessment**: The critical question is whether the hypoxic damage's timing (a matter of hours before death) is consistent with a natural death or SIDS. In cases of SIDS or other natural deaths, the process leading to death can sometimes involve hypoxia. However, the timing and nature of such hypoxia can vary.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to a natural cause like SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is uncertain. It could be argued that if the death was due to a natural cause, the hypoxic damage could still be part of the dying process. However, the doctor's statement implies a specific timing that might not align with a typical SIDS death, which is usually unexpected and without a clear agonal period.

Given these considerations and the information provided, it's challenging to directly correlate the timing of hypoxic damage with innocence or guilt without more context on how SIDS or other natural causes could result in such damage.

To still provide an assessment based on the given scenario and instructions:

**60**
Let's analyze the information given. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The question pertains to the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before his death, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.

First, we need to understand that hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. In the context of Ben's death, the autopsy findings of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries, were initially interpreted as indicative of smothering, potentially implicating Jane.

However, if Jane is not guilty, and if we consider alternative explanations for the infants' deaths, we must assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring hours before Ben's death in the context of a natural or accidental cause.

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact mechanisms behind SIDS are not well understood, it is not typically associated with clear evidence of hypoxic damage or other specific injuries found during an autopsy. The presence of significant hypoxic damage, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages in Ben's autopsy suggests a more complex scenario than what is typically seen in SIDS.

If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death would be unusual because SIDS does not typically present with clear signs of prolonged hypoxia before death. The infants are generally found dead without prior signs of distress that would be expected to cause such significant hypoxic damage.

However, without a clear understanding of the exact circumstances leading to Ben's death, it's challenging to definitively state the timing or cause of the hypoxic damage. If we were to consider an alternative explanation that doesn't involve smothering by Jane, we would still need to reconcile the autopsy findings with the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty.

Given the information and assuming Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death due to a cause other than smothering (like some form of natural or accidental asphyxia or another mechanism not related to Jane's actions) is difficult to quantify directly from the given data. However, it's worth noting that the detailed autopsy findings (hypoxic damage, injuries) are not typical for SIDS, which complicates the assessment.

The probability judgment should reflect the likelihood based on the given scenario and available information.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To address this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively).

2. **Autopsy Findings**: 
   - For Ben, the autopsy revealed injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.
   - Further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs (initially attributed to natural causes) showed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.

3. **The Allegation**: The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, implying that this was a sign of a traumatic or violent act (potentially smothering) rather than a natural cause.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The deaths could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition with no clear cause or mechanism but associated with certain risk factors.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**:
   - If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to smothering or any intentional act by her.
   - SIDS is a possible alternative explanation for both deaths, given that it is a recognized, though unexplained, cause of infant death.

6. **Hypoxic Damage in the Context of SIDS or Natural Causes**:
   - Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by insufficient oxygen. In the context of infant death, it could be related to various factors, including but not limited to, smothering.
   - If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage might still be observed due to the underlying cause of death or the circumstances surrounding it.

7. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**:
   - The allegation that hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is based on medical interpretation. 
   - If Jane is not guilty, and assuming the death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the timing and cause of hypoxic damage would need to be considered in that context.

8. **Analyzing the Statement**:
   - The doctor's statement about the timing of hypoxic damage is an expert opinion based on observed injuries and autopsy findings, which are used to infer that the damage occurred a short time before death.
   - If Jane is not guilty, and the death was natural (e.g., SIDS), the observed hypoxic damage could still be a part of the natural dying process or a terminal event rather than a separate act of smothering.

9. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, given Jane is not guilty, depends on understanding that hypoxic damage can occur due to various reasons leading to death, not just smothering.
   - In cases of SIDS, the exact mechanism of death is often unclear, but it is known that some infants may show signs of distress or struggle before dying.

Given Jane is not guilty, and thus assuming the death was due to a natural cause or SIDS, the hypoxic damage could still be a part of the dying process. Therefore, it's plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred in the period leading up to Ben's death.

The probability judgment is: **50**
## Step 1: Understand the given information about the case and the condition of Ben's brain.
The case involves Jane being charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben. Ben's autopsy revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. The prosecution alleges that this hypoxic damage was caused by smothering, which occurred a matter of hours before death.

## Step 2: Consider the alternative explanation for the deaths, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of infants, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. It is more common among boys. The question implies that if Jane is not guilty, SIDS could be a possible explanation for the deaths.

## Step 3: Analyze the condition of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and its implications.
Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The allegation is that this damage was caused by smothering a matter of hours before Ben's death. However, the timing and cause of hypoxic damage can vary and may not always be directly linked to an immediate cause of death like smothering.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty.
If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to other causes, such as SIDS. SIDS is characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation. Hypoxic damage could potentially occur in various scenarios, not just smothering. However, if Ben died of SIDS, the hypoxic damage might not necessarily be linked to a specific event like smothering occurring hours before death.

## Step 5: Evaluate the probability based on the given condition that Jane is not guilty.
Given that Jane is not guilty, we are considering alternative explanations for Ben's death, such as SIDS. The presence of hypoxic damage does not directly imply smothering or guilt. Research and medical understanding suggest that infants who die from SIDS may have had underlying vulnerabilities or conditions that could lead to hypoxic damage or other pathological findings.

## Step 6: Consider the medical and pathological aspects of SIDS and hypoxic damage.
In cases of SIDS, the exact cause of death is unknown, but it is believed that a combination of factors contributes to the death. Hypoxic damage could potentially occur due to various reasons, including but not limited to, respiratory issues or other health conditions.

## Step 7: Assess the likelihood of hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death in the context of SIDS or other non-homicidal causes.
If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the hypoxic damage could have occurred due to a process related to his death, but not necessarily due to smothering. The timing and causation would be different from the alleged smothering.

## Step 8: Determine the probability judgment.
Since Jane is not guilty, implying the deaths might be due to SIDS or another cause, the specific allegation about the timing of hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) due to smothering becomes less relevant. The actual cause of hypoxic damage could vary. However, the question is asking for the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, which requires considering if SIDS or other natural causes could result in such damage.

## Step 9: Final consideration for the probability.
The hypoxic damage could potentially be related to the process leading to death, regardless of the cause. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming SIDS or a similar condition is a plausible explanation, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death might still be considered in the context of the underlying condition leading to death.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
To analyze the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively). The autopsy on Ben revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries.

2. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing**: Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, then the death of her children could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other natural or accidental causes.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths could be due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions. SIDS is mentioned as a possible alternative explanation for the deaths. However, the presence of specific injuries (like bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung for Andy, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids for Ben) complicates this explanation because SIDS is typically characterized by a lack of explanation for the death after thorough investigation, including autopsy.

4. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could potentially be attributed to other causes. However, the specific allegation that the damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" suggests a relatively acute event. 

5. **Considering Alternative Causes**: For Ben's death, if not due to smothering by Jane, other explanations could involve accidental or natural causes that led to hypoxia. However, the detailed autopsy findings (e.g., injuries to the ribs and spinal cord) are not typical for SIDS.

6. **Likelihood Assessment**: Given that Jane is not guilty, we are exploring alternative explanations for Ben's death and the timing of the hypoxic damage. If we were to consider that the deaths were not due to Jane's actions (i.e., not smothering), we still need to reconcile the autopsy findings with possible causes.

7. **Conclusion**: The presence of significant autopsy findings (like hypoxic brain damage, rib and spinal cord injuries) in Ben points towards a non-SIDS cause. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative cause for the hypoxic damage, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred "a matter of hours before death" would depend on the nature of that alternative cause.

However, the detailed medical evidence (hypoxic damage, specific injuries) doesn't directly support SIDS or other 'natural causes' as an explanation. Thus, while we're considering Jane's innocence, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage as "a matter of hours before death" is still tied to understanding the cause of that damage.

If Jane is innocent, and we consider an alternative scenario where the hypoxic damage's timing is evaluated, we must remember that the prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation of these medical findings as indicative of smothering. If not smothering, the medical evidence still suggests a severe, acute event.

**Given this context and the complexity of attributing the cause and timing of hypoxic damage without a clear alternative explanation**, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is still relatively plausible because it doesn't directly contradict the hypothesis of innocence or guilt; it's a medical fact that needs to be reconciled with the cause of death.

The judgment on the likelihood is thus related to how one interprets the medical evidence in the context of possible innocence.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

First, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to other causes, one of which could be Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact cause or mechanism of SIDS is not known, it is associated with various risk factors. The presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, among other findings in Ben, is not typical for a straightforward SIDS diagnosis, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when other causes of death are ruled out and there's no clear explanation for the death.

However, the presence of hypoxic damage, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages could suggest that there was an event or condition leading to these findings before death. If Jane is not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where these findings need to be explained by other means.

The critical piece of information here is whether the hypoxic damage could have occurred a matter of hours before death in a scenario where Jane is not guilty. Hypoxic damage (due to lack of oxygen) can occur in various contexts, not all of which imply foul play or smothering by another person.

If we assume Jane is not guilty and consider alternative explanations, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a crucial question. For SIDS or other natural causes to be considered, the autopsy findings should be scrutinized for alternative explanations.

Research into SIDS has shown that some cases may involve underlying vulnerabilities or previous episodes of hypoxia or other stressors, though these are not typically quantifiable or directly linked to the timing of death in a straightforward manner.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a significant assertion. If Jane is not guilty, for this statement to be true, there would need to be an alternative explanation for the hypoxic damage occurring around the time of death.

However, if the death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the expectation of hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours before death" may not directly correlate with the typical understanding of SIDS, as SIDS is generally an unexpected death without a clear preceding illness or condition that would cause such specific damage.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a result of an external, non-fatal event, because SIDS is characterized by its lack of clear cause.

Given the scenario and focusing on the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we would lean towards a lower probability for this specific timing being directly related to the cause of death if it were SIDS or a similar natural cause, mainly because the specific timing and nature of such damage would be unusual for a straightforward SIDS case.

**20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

First, let's understand that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries, was initially taken as evidence of smothering. However, if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider whether these findings could be consistent with SIDS or another natural cause.

The specific finding of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death is critical. Hypoxic damage typically results from a lack of oxygen. In the context of SIDS or other natural causes, it's not straightforward to attribute the timing of hypoxic damage directly to a specific event like smothering without other corroborating evidence.

However, the fact that Ben was found unwell and attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful could imply that there was a period of distress or illness before his death. If we are to assume Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death is attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the issue is whether the hypoxic damage could be consistent with this scenario.

Some research suggests that certain pathological features, including hypoxic changes, can be seen in SIDS cases, potentially due to agonal or pre-terminal events. However, the interpretation of these findings can be complex and subject to debate among experts.

Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death could be due to SIDS or a similar cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death would depend on whether such damage can occur in the context of a natural or unexplained death.

The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death suggests a causal link between this damage and the events leading to Ben's death. If Jane is not guilty, one possible interpretation is that the hypoxic damage could be related to the terminal events or agonal period associated with Ben's death, which could be consistent with a natural cause if we accept that such causes can lead to observable hypoxic damage in the hours preceding death.

However, attributing the exact timing and cause of hypoxic damage in the context of SIDS or a similar syndrome is challenging without more specific evidence.

Therefore, considering the possibility that Jane is not guilty and Ben's death could be due to a natural or unexplained cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death could be considered plausible if one accepts that natural or unexplained causes can lead to such damage.

**80**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the alternative explanation provided for the deaths of Andy and Ben, which is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. The provided information states that there are risk factors correlated with SIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is noted to be more common among boys than girls.

The key issue here is whether the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, allegedly occurring a matter of hours before death, is consistent with SIDS if Jane is not guilty (i.e., if the deaths are due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering).

Research and medical understanding suggest that SIDS is associated with various pathological findings, including intrathoracic petechiae (tiny hemorrhages), pulmonary edema, and other signs. However, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain, along with injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as found in Ben's autopsy, is not typical for SIDS. These findings suggest a possible traumatic or asphyxial cause.

The specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is critical. If Jane is not guilty, and the death is due to SIDS, the expectation would be that the infant died suddenly and unexpectedly without a prolonged period of hypoxia preceding death that could be pinpointed to "a matter of hours before death."

However, some infants who die of SIDS may have had some agonal (dying) changes, and it's conceivable that some form of hypoxic damage could occur in the process of dying. Yet, the described injuries and the implication of a distinct period of hypoxia before death are not characteristic of the typical presentation of SIDS.

Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (and assuming SIDS as an alternative explanation), it is less likely that the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain (occurring a matter of hours before death) would be consistent with SIDS, given that SIDS typically involves a sudden death without a clear agonal period that can be timed in such a manner.

Given this context and understanding, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty (and thus, assuming SIDS or a similar natural cause) would be considered low because the described autopsy findings and the timing of hypoxic damage are not typical for SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The deaths were initially considered potentially natural, but after the autopsy on Ben showed significant injuries, further investigation into Andy's death was conducted, revealing potential signs of trauma.

2. **Hypoxic Damage**: The autopsy on Ben revealed hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. The prosecution's expert suggested this damage occurred a matter of hours before death.

3. **Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, then the implication is that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by her. An alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death.

4. **SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of death have been ruled out. It is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage, along with other injuries found in Ben, complicates the attribution of his death to SIDS, as SIDS typically does not present with such clear signs of trauma or hypoxic damage.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for the hypoxic damage. SIDS does not typically involve hypoxic damage as a characteristic feature. The presence of hypoxic damage, along with other traumatic injuries, suggests that the death may not be attributed to SIDS. However, if we are to consider that Jane is not guilty, we need to think of other scenarios where hypoxic damage occurs without being a result of her actions.

6. **Causes of Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage can result from various causes, including, but not limited to, respiratory problems, cardiac issues, or accidental asphyxiation. However, attributing it to happening "a matter of hours before death" under the assumption that Jane is not guilty requires considering if there are plausible alternative explanations that could result in such a timeline.

7. **Conclusion**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage's timing is still linked to the circumstances of Ben's death. The presence of significant injuries suggests that the death was not simply SIDS. However, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring "a matter of hours before death" under alternative, non-criminal explanations is difficult to assess without more context on potential causes.

Given the complexity and the need to consider alternative explanations for Ben's death that do not involve Jane's guilt, and acknowledging that the injuries and hypoxic damage are indicative of a non-SIDS cause, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty depends heavily on the plausibility of alternative explanations for the observed injuries.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the context and evidence.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. The presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries, complicates the picture because such specific pathological findings are not typical descriptions of SIDS, which is generally diagnosed after excluding other causes of death.

However, the assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a medical interpretation that could be scrutinized. If Jane is not guilty and the death is due to SIDS or another natural cause, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes less directly relevant to Jane's guilt or innocence.

The key issue is whether the hypoxic damage can be reconciled with a non-homicide explanation. Some research and medical understanding suggest that certain conditions leading to SIDS might involve episodes of hypoxia or other stressors before death, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.

The prosecution's case hinges on the interpretation that the hypoxic damage and other injuries were indicative of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming an alternative cause of death such as SIDS, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a result of natural causes or an accident rather than smothering is less clear.

However, the detailed pathological findings in Ben (and the re-examination findings in Andy) were used to build a case against Jane, implying that they are considered significant and not typical for SIDS. 

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are attributed to SIDS or a similar natural cause, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death due to natural processes or an accident is still uncertain. The presence of such damage and its timing would be subject to different interpretations.

Given the complexities and the fact that the prosecution's case relies heavily on the interpretation of these medical findings as evidence of smothering, if Jane is not guilty, it suggests an alternative explanation for the hypoxic damage. However, SIDS or natural causes wouldn't typically be described with such specific damage unless it's part of a broader syndrome or condition.

Therefore, considering the context that the question is asking for a probability judgment under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and linking it back to the nature of SIDS or other potential natural causes, we have to assess the likelihood based on the given information and known facts about SIDS.

The condition described is not typical for SIDS, but the question is about the likelihood under the assumption of innocence.

**50**
To address the question, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Case**: Jane is charged with the murder of her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering. The death of both children occurred when they were very young (11 weeks and 8 weeks old, respectively).

2. **Autopsy Findings for Ben**: The autopsy on Ben revealed injuries including hypoxic damage to the brain, which indicates a lack of sufficient oxygen. The prosecution's expert testified that this hypoxic damage must have occurred a matter of hours before death.

3. **Implication of Hypoxic Damage**: Hypoxic damage to the brain in infants can result from various causes, including smothering, which would be consistent with the prosecution's case against Jane. However, it can also be caused by other factors that lead to asphyxia or reduced oxygen supply.

4. **Alternative Explanation - SIDS**: The defense might argue that the deaths could be due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition where infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, typically during their first year, without a clear cause.

5. **Assessing the Likelihood if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (i.e., not due to smothering or any other form of intentional harm). In this scenario, we are to consider how likely it is that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before death.

6. **Analyzing the Hypoxic Damage in the Context of Innocence**: If Jane is innocent, then the cause of Ben's death might be related to natural or accidental factors. However, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) as suggested by the prosecution's expert is more indicative of a specific event or action causing the hypoxia rather than a prolonged or chronic condition.

7. **Considering SIDS and Hypoxic Damage**: SIDS is by definition an unexplained death. While SIDS deaths can sometimes be associated with findings that might suggest hypoxia (since death often occurs during sleep and could potentially involve some degree of asphyxia or respiratory distress), the presence of significant hypoxic damage to the brain, along with other injuries (like rib injuries and hemorrhages in the eyes), is not typical for a SIDS death. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with such significant pathological findings.

8. **Evaluating the Probability**: Given that Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths were due to some other cause (potentially SIDS or another natural cause), the presence of significant hypoxic damage and other traumatic findings is unusual. The expert testimony suggesting that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death implies a specific event. If Jane is innocent and did not cause the hypoxic damage through smothering or another action, then one would have to consider alternative explanations for both the hypoxic damage and the other injuries found.

However, the presence of such significant and specific injuries (hypoxic damage, rib injuries, etc.) makes it less likely that the death was simply due to SIDS or another natural cause without any foul play.

**Given the Context and Assuming Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to a natural or unexplained cause, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death as a result of some non-criminal, natural process is relatively low. This is because significant hypoxic damage, as described, is not characteristic of SIDS.

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and possible explanations for the damage.

If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant. The autopsy findings in Ben's case, including hypoxic damage to the brain, injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical of SIDS, as SIDS is generally diagnosed when no other cause of death is found after a thorough investigation, including autopsy.

However, the presence of hypoxic damage indicates a lack of oxygen to the brain, which could be due to various causes, not necessarily smothering. The fact that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death suggests an acute event.

If Jane is not guilty and the deaths are not due to smothering, we must consider other explanations for the hypoxic damage. While SIDS is not typically associated with such specific pathological findings, other natural or accidental causes might potentially explain some of the findings.

However, the specific timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) as alleged is critical. In cases of SIDS or other natural deaths, significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typically expected as it suggests an acute event leading to hypoxia.

Given that Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage to have occurred a matter of hours before Ben's death, there would need to be an alternative explanation for this damage that is consistent with a lack of culpability on Jane's part. 

The information provided suggests that if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death by an event not related to smothering or her actions is potentially low because the described autopsy findings are indicative of a significant and acute event.

However, it's also important to consider that the exact cause and timing of such damage can be complex and subject to various interpretations.

**Given the lack of direct evidence linking the timing of hypoxic damage to Jane's guilt or innocence directly and considering alternative explanations are not typically characterized by such damage, a reasonable inference might lean towards a lower likelihood under the not guilty scenario for the specific timing being as alleged.**

**Probability Judgment: 20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

First, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

SIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature. While the exact mechanisms behind SIDS are not fully understood, research has identified various risk factors, including the infant's age, sleep environment, and genetic predispositions.

The post-mortem findings for Ben included hypoxic damage to the brain, among other injuries. Hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage could be interpreted in different ways. However, SIDS diagnosis is typically one of exclusion, meaning that other causes of death must be ruled out before SIDS can be considered.

The statement that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain "must have been caused a matter of hours before death" is a medical opinion that implies a specific timeline for when the hypoxic damage occurred relative to Ben's death.

If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death is considered to be due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and its timing becomes a critical issue. SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexpected and unexplained, but they do not typically present with clear evidence of hypoxic damage occurring hours before death in the medical literature.

However, given that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and involves the absence of a clear cause of death, if we are to assume Jane's innocence and explore alternative explanations like SIDS, we must consider that the medical interpretation of the hypoxic damage might not directly align with typical SIDS cases.

The likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, assuming Jane is not guilty (and thus potentially considering SIDS or a similar natural cause), hinges on whether such damage is consistent with known or possible mechanisms of SIDS or other natural causes.

The key here is understanding that if Jane is not guilty, and we are considering an alternative like SIDS, the specifics of Ben's autopsy findings (like hypoxic damage) might still be subject to interpretation. 

However, the specific timing (a matter of hours before death) is a detail that could be crucial. 

If Ben died of SIDS, one might expect the hypoxic damage to be more closely associated with the agonal period (the period around death) rather than being clearly separated by "a matter of hours."

Given the available information and the nature of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, the assertion that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death may not directly correlate with typical understandings of SIDS or natural infant death.

To directly assess the probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is complex and involves interpreting the medical evidence in the context of potential innocence.

The probability judgment is: **20** 

(This reflects a low likelihood given the context of innocence and SIDS, as the specific timing and nature of hypoxic damage might not typically align with SIDS or could be subject to different interpretations.)

**20**
To assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Jane is accused of murdering her two sons, Andy and Ben, by smothering them. The autopsy on Ben revealed hypoxic damage to the brain among other injuries. The prosecution's case partly relies on the timing and interpretation of these injuries.

2. **Assessing the Hypothesis that Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering by Jane but could be attributed to other causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural or accidental causes.

3. **Hypoxic Damage and Its Timing**: The hypoxic damage refers to injury caused by a lack of oxygen. If Ben died from SIDS or another cause not related to smothering by Jane, the hypoxic damage could have occurred due to various reasons, such as a medical condition or an accident.

4. **Evaluating the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, and assuming that Ben's death was due to a cause other than smothering (like SIDS or another medical condition), the presence of hypoxic damage doesn't directly support or refute Jane's guilt. However, the doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is a critical piece of information.

Given that SIDS is by definition an unexplained death and does not typically involve a clear, identifiable cause of hypoxic damage shortly before death, if Ben's death was SIDS or a similar unexplained cause, it's less likely that there would be clear evidence of hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death unless the underlying cause of death somehow led to such damage.

However, if Ben's death was due to SIDS or a similar natural cause, it's still possible for there to be some agonal or pre-terminal hypoxia (lack of oxygen) as part of the dying process, which might not be directly related to an action by Jane.

Therefore, the assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death could be plausible under various scenarios, including natural causes, but it is not directly related to Jane's guilt or innocence regarding smothering.

**The probability judgment here hinges on understanding that if Jane is not guilty, the cause of hypoxic damage would be attributed to other factors. While SIDS doesn't typically involve a clear, prolonged hypoxic episode before death, other natural causes or conditions could potentially result in such damage.**

Probability Judgment: 50
To evaluate the likelihood of the similarities between the incidents involving Andy and Ben if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the similarities.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). Infants are most vulnerable to SIDS during the first few months of life, with the peak incidence typically around 2-4 months. Thus, dying at around the same age could be coincidental if both deaths were due to SIDS or a similar natural cause.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both babies died after being fed and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. The timing and circumstances could be coincidental, especially if both incidents occurred under similar daily routines.

3. **Assessing the Likelihood of Similarities if Jane is Not Guilty**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that both deaths were due to natural or accidental causes rather than smothering by Jane. The similarities could be due to various factors:
   - **Coincidence and Shared Circumstances**: Both babies being cared for by Jane under similar conditions and routines could result in similarities in the circumstances of their deaths, even if those deaths were due to independent natural causes.
   - **Environmental or Genetic Factors**: Shared environmental or genetic factors could potentially contribute to both babies being at risk for similar types of natural or accidental deaths.

However, some of the observed similarities are more likely to occur if there is a common underlying cause or circumstance. The fact that both deaths occurred under Jane's care and shared certain characteristics (e.g., age, time relative to feeding) could be seen as coincidental or related to the care environment.

The key issue here is assessing how likely it is for two SIDS or naturally caused deaths to share these specific similarities. While SIDS can occur at any time and under various circumstances, the fact that both deaths shared several characteristics (age, timing relative to feeding, and discovery by Jane) is noteworthy.

Given the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and if we consider that both deaths could be due to SIDS or a similar cause, the probability of these similarities occurring is not extremely high but is not negligible either, as some level of coincidence is expected.

Probability Judgment: 30
To assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Hypoxic Damage and Hemorrhages**: These are indicative of a lack of oxygen and potential trauma or stress on the infant's body. While they are consistent with smothering, they can also result from other causes.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages could be due to other medical conditions or accidental causes. However, the presence of these specific findings is more typically associated with traumatic or asphyxial events.

3. **SIDS and Natural Causes**: SIDS or other natural causes might not typically present with such clear evidence of hypoxic damage or hemorrhages unless there was an underlying condition that caused these symptoms. Some natural conditions or accidents could potentially cause similar findings.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) depends on whether there are plausible alternative explanations. While it's possible for natural causes or accidents to result in some similar findings, the specific pattern observed is often associated with asphyxia or trauma.

Given that SIDS is by definition unexplained and typically does not involve clear evidence of hypoxic damage or significant trauma, the presence of these findings is somewhat unusual for a natural or SIDS death.

Probability Judgment: 20
To assess the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider alternative explanations for these findings.

1. **Interpretation of Findings**: These injuries are often associated with non-accidental injury or abuse. A torn frenulum is particularly concerning for inflicted trauma, as it is typically caused by a direct blow to the mouth. Bruises and blood in the lung can also be indicative of significant trauma.

2. **Alternative Explanations**: If Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether there are plausible alternative explanations for these findings. While it's possible for infants to suffer accidental injuries, certain injuries like a torn frenulum are rarely accidental.

3. **Medical or Accidental Causes**: Some medical conditions or rare accidents could potentially result in similar findings, but they are not common explanations for the combination of these specific injuries.

4. **Assessing the Likelihood**: If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific and significant injuries occurring due to natural causes, accidents, or other non-inflicted reasons is relatively low. The presence of multiple signs indicative of trauma (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) suggests a high level of suspicion for non-accidental injury.

Given the seriousness and nature of these injuries and their typical association with non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings is relatively low.

To assess the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the circumstances and the potential explanations for the observed similarities.

1. **Age at Death**: Both babies were approximately the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks). The age range for SIDS is typically within the first year, with a peak around 2-4 months. The fact that both died at a relatively young age could be coincidental or related to the underlying risk factors for SIDS, which are not clearly understood.

2. **Time of Day and Circumstances**: Both deaths occurred after feeding and when Jane was alone with them. SIDS can occur at any time and is not directly linked to feeding, although there might be some debate about the positioning of the infant post-feeding. However, it's plausible that the time of day and the circumstance (being alone with Jane) could be coincidental, given that Jane was the primary caregiver and was likely to be with them during these times.

3. **Discovery by Jane**: Jane found both babies unconscious. This similarity is more related to the household dynamics (Jane being the primary caregiver) than to the cause of death.

If Jane is not guilty, the deaths are likely due to SIDS or another natural cause. The key question is how likely it is for two SIDS deaths in the same family to share these similarities.

SIDS is known to have a familial component, although the exact mechanisms are not well understood. The recurrence risk of SIDS in a family is higher than in the general population, but still relatively low. Studies have suggested that the risk of a second SIDS death in the same family is higher than the general population risk, but quantifying this risk is challenging.

The similarities between the two incidents can be partly explained by the circumstances (e.g., both being cared for by Jane, similar age). However, the probability that both deaths are SIDS and share these specific similarities involves considering both the likelihood of SIDS recurring in a family and the coincidence of the specific circumstances.

While there's an increased risk of SIDS in a family that has already experienced a SIDS death, the absolute risk remains relatively low. The specific similarities (age, time of day, discovery by Jane) could occur by chance, especially given the context that Jane was the primary caregiver and the deaths occurred within a relatively short timeframe.

Quantifying the exact probability of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty is challenging without more specific statistical data on SIDS recurrence and the likelihood of these specific circumstances coinciding. However, it is not implausible that two infant deaths in the same family could share some similarities due to shared circumstances and caregiving arrangements.

If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids need to be explained by other causes. 

Hypoxic damage (lack of oxygen) and hemorrhages in infants can be caused by various factors, including but not limited to smothering, other forms of asphyxia, or natural causes. 

SIDS is generally not associated with significant pathological findings like hypoxic damage or hemorrhages. The presence of these findings in Ben's autopsy is more indicative of an underlying cause that led to asphyxia or trauma.

While it's possible that there could be other natural or accidental explanations for these findings, the specific combination of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is often associated with asphyxial events, which includes smothering.

If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider alternative explanations for these findings, such as an undiagnosed medical condition or an accidental cause. However, the presence of these specific autopsy findings is not typical for SIDS.

The likelihood of these findings occurring naturally or by accident, without any foul play, is relatively low given the specific nature of the injuries.

20
If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's autopsy would need to be explained by other causes.

These injuries are often associated with non-accidental trauma or abuse. A torn frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum) is particularly concerning for non-accidental injury, as it can be caused by a blow to the mouth or forced feeding.

However, it's also possible that some of these findings could be due to other causes, such as accidental trauma or medical conditions. Nevertheless, the combination of these specific injuries is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma.

The original autopsy concluded that Andy's death was due to natural causes, and it's possible that these injuries were not initially detected or were not considered significant at the time. However, if Jane is not guilty, it would be challenging to explain the presence of these injuries, which are indicative of trauma.

The likelihood of these specific injuries occurring without any foul play is relatively low, given their nature and the fact that they are indicative of non-accidental trauma.

If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could be due to various causes unrelated to her actions. The doctor's statement that the hypoxic damage must have occurred a matter of hours before death is a medical opinion based on the autopsy findings.

If Ben's death was due to a natural cause or an accident, it's possible that the hypoxic damage could have occurred due to a medical condition or an event that happened hours before death. However, the doctor's assessment is that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death, which suggests a relatively acute event.

The timing of the hypoxic damage is a matter of medical interpretation. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death would depend on the underlying cause of the damage.

The fact that the doctor is confident in the timing of the hypoxic damage suggests that it is based on the autopsy findings. However, without more information on the underlying cause, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of this timing.

If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to a natural cause or an accident, it's still possible that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death. However, the likelihood of this would depend on the specific circumstances.
