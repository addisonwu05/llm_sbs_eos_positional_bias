The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the
hospital.
Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering
were found, such as petechiae (tiny red or purple spots that can appear on the skin).
The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the
dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.
Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such
injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.
