  "Let's carefully analyze this case:\n\n1. Ben's autopsy revealed:\n- Hypoxic damage to the brain\n- Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\n- Injuries to ribs and spinal cord\n\n2. These specific findings are medically consistent with:\n- Deliberate smothering\n- Violent trauma\n- Direct physical compression of the infant's body\n\n3. While SIDS is mentioned as a possible explanation:\n- SIDS typically does not cause specific localized injuries\n- SIDS does not typically result in brain hypoxia or eye haemorrhages\n- The additional physical trauma findings are NOT characteristic of SIDS\n\n4. The medical evidence strongly suggests non-accidental injury:\n- The specific pattern of injuries\n- Occurrence in two successive children\n- Precise medical indicators of intentional trauma\n\n5. Medical experts would likely conclude these injuries are extremely unlikely to occur naturally or through SIDS\n\nGiven the medical evidence, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability of these specific injuries occurring naturally is very low.\n\nConsidering the specificity and clear medical indicators of deliberate trauma, and excluding natural explanations:\n\n50",
