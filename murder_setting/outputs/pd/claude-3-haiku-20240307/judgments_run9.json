  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents is quite high. The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare but well-documented phenomenon that can account for the unexpected deaths of apparently healthy infants. The risk factors associated with SIDS, such as age, gender, and time of day, could explain the similarities between the two incidents.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the similarities between the two incidents would occur if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents is also quite high. The fact that both babies died at a similar age, time of day, and while Jane was alone with them suggests a pattern of behavior that is consistent with intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the similarities between the two incidents would occur if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These types of injuries are more commonly associated with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages would occur if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high. These types of injuries are commonly associated with intentional harm, such as smothering, which is consistent with the charges against Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages would occur if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is often characterized by a rapid and unexpected death, without clear signs of preceding medical issues.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused in the hours preceding death is consistent with intentional harm, such as smothering, which would result in a rapid and acute decline in oxygen supply to the brain.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low. These types of injuries are more commonly associated with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these injuries would be present in Andy if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high. These types of injuries are characteristic of smothering and other forms of intentional harm, which would be consistent with the charges against Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these injuries would be present in Andy if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is quite likely. The lack of these additional injuries could suggest that Ben's death was not due to intentional suffocation, but rather a result of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that petechiae and other typical smothering injuries would be absent in Ben if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is less likely. The presence of hypoxic damage and other injuries found in Ben's case would suggest that he was subjected to some form of intentional harm, and the lack of additional visible injuries does not necessarily mean that smothering did not occur.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that petechiae and other typical smothering injuries would be absent in Ben if Jane is guilty is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high. If the injuries were a result of natural causes or SIDS, it is plausible that they were not evident or noticeable to the nurses at the time of the hospital visit.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low. If the injuries were the result of intentional harm, such as smothering, it is more likely that they would have been present or at least noticeable to the nurses at the time of the hospital visit.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is quite high. These types of injuries can be associated with natural causes of death or occur as a result of resuscitation attempts, which would be consistent with a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is moderate. While these types of injuries can occur in natural deaths or as a result of resuscitation attempts, their presence does not necessarily rule out the possibility of intentional harm. The other injuries found, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, would still suggest a more deliberate cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben if Jane is guilty is:\n\n50%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can commonly occur as a result of the physical efforts made to revive a baby, especially in a situation where the cause of death is unclear and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a possibility.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely due to resuscitation attempts is lower. The presence of the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, along with the subsequent finding of hypoxic damage and other injuries in Ben's case, suggests a pattern of intentional harm that is less likely to be explained by the resuscitation efforts alone.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is guilty is:\n\n40%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murder of her two children is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the overall analysis of the evidence, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
