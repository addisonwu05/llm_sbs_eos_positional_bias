  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a well-recognized phenomenon that can occur without any clear underlying cause, and the autopsy findings could potentially be attributed to natural causes or non-abusive incidents.\n\nGiven the information provided, a reasonable probability judgment would be:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case are highly likely to be indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma is relatively high, as these findings can also be associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at similar times of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, is relatively high. These similarities could be consistent with a natural phenomenon like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which can have a clustering effect.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at similar times of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are highly likely. These similarities would be consistent with a pattern of intentional, deliberate actions by the perpetrator.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively high. In cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the underlying mechanism that leads to hypoxia and death is not well understood, and the timeline can be unpredictable.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high. This timeline would be consistent with a deliberate, intentional act of smothering or other violent trauma that led to the infant's death.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The lack of documentation of the injuries by the nurses suggests they may have developed or become more apparent after the initial hospital visit, which would be more consistent with natural causes or accidental injury rather than intentional harm.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is very unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. A guilty party would have likely inflicted the injuries shortly before the hospital visit, and the nurses would have missed or failed to document them, which seems improbable.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm. These findings can be common in cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural infant deaths.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively low. These injuries would be more likely to be the result of intentional, violent trauma inflicted by the perpetrator.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is highly likely. The lack of these telltale signs would be consistent with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes of death.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively unlikely. The perpetrator would be expected to have left more clear signs of the violent trauma that caused the infant's death.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are highly likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts, as such injuries are common in the process of reviving a baby. The initial assessment of the injuries being due to the resuscitation efforts would be plausible if Jane was not the perpetrator.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were solely due to the resuscitation attempts is relatively low. Given the pattern of injuries and the subsequent findings on the re-examination, it is more likely that at least some of the injuries were caused by intentional harm, such as smothering, prior to the resuscitation efforts.\n\n30",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence provided, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n80",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
