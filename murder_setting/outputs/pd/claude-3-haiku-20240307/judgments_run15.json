  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low. These findings are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of abuse, which would be unexpected if the death was due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these findings in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n50",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case would be highly likely. These findings are characteristic of smothering or other forms of abuse, which would be expected if the death was due to intentional suffocation rather than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these findings in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These findings are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be unexpected if the death was due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these findings in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n30",

  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. This specific timeline of the brain damage would be more characteristic of intentional suffocation rather than a natural cause of death such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n30",

  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is relatively high. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) can affect infants of similar ages, and it is not uncommon for SIDS-related deaths to occur after feeding and when the parent is alone with the child.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these similarities occurring in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is extremely high. The close timing, age of the victims, and circumstances of the deaths would be highly unlikely to occur by chance and would be more characteristic of a deliberate, repeated pattern of behavior.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these similarities occurring in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high. These findings can occur naturally or as a result of resuscitation attempts, and do not necessarily indicate intentional abuse.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these findings in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is also relatively high. These findings can occur naturally or as a result of resuscitation attempts, and do not necessarily indicate intentional abuse in the case of a guilty party.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of these findings in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high. Injuries can sometimes be missed or not visible initially, especially in an emergency situation. This would be more consistent with a natural death rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low. If the injuries were inflicted by Jane, it would be expected that they would have been visible upon admission, rather than only discovered later during the autopsy.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high. Injuries such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can commonly occur during CPR and other resuscitation efforts, especially on a small infant.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely due to resuscitation attempts is relatively low. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would be more indicative of intentional harm and smothering, rather than just the result of CPR and reviving efforts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high. The presence of some injuries like the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages is concerning, but the lack of other hallmark signs of smothering would be more consistent with a natural death rather than intentional suffocation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of the absence of petechiae and other typical smothering injuries in Ben in the absence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low. The presence of other concerning injuries like the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, coupled with the absence of hallmark signs of smothering, would be less consistent with intentional suffocation and more suggestive of a natural cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability of the absence of petechiae and other typical smothering injuries in Ben in the presence of abuse is estimated to be:\n\n30",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n70",
  "Based on the evidence provided and my analysis, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
