  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low. These findings are more indicative of abuse and smothering, rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these injuries being present in Andy's case is estimated to be:\n\n35%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high. These findings are highly indicative of abuse and smothering, which would be consistent with Jane being guilty of the murders.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these injuries being present in Andy's case is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These findings are more indicative of abuse and smothering, rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these injuries being present in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n25%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. This close timing between the brain damage and death is more indicative of an intentional act, such as smothering, rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic brain damage occurred just hours before Ben's death is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high. This close timing between the brain damage and death is highly indicative of an intentional act, such as smothering, which would be consistent with Jane being guilty of the murder.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic brain damage occurred just hours before Ben's death is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is relatively low. The close timing, age of the babies, and circumstances of the deaths are more suggestive of a deliberate pattern of behavior rather than a coincidence.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities between the two incidents is estimated to be:\n\n20%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is relatively high. The spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, rather than being indicators of abuse.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is moderate. While the spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, the overall pattern of injuries raises suspicion of potential foul play.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high. The lack of these typical smothering injuries would be more consistent with a natural or accidental death, rather than intentional suffocation.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of petechiae and other smothering injuries in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low. The lack of these typical smothering injuries would be less consistent with an intentional suffocation, and would raise questions about the cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of petechiae and other smothering injuries in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n35%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high. Injuries such as bruises and a torn frenulum can commonly occur during efforts to revive an infant, and would not necessarily indicate abuse or intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy's case being due to resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low. Given the pattern of injuries, including bruises and a torn frenulum, these findings would be more indicative of abuse and smothering, rather than just resulting from attempts to revive the infant.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy's case being due to resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high. The lack of documentation of these injuries by the hospital staff would suggest they developed later, potentially from resuscitation attempts or other natural causes, rather than being inflicted intentionally.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low. The absence of documentation of these injuries by the hospital staff would be less likely if they were the result of intentional harm inflicted by Jane prior to the baby being brought in.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the presence of injuries indicative of smothering, and the lack of typical SIDS-related findings, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murders of her two children is:\n\n75%",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 75% that the defendant, Jane, is guilty, my verdict is:\n\nGUILTY"
