  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents occurring by chance is relatively low.\n\nThe similarities, such as the babies being of similar age, dying at similar times of the day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone, are highly unlikely to happen by chance if the deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which means the probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely low. Additionally, the discovery of the injuries and haemorrhages in the second son's autopsy further reduces the likelihood of these incidents being due to natural causes or SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring by chance is:\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is very high.\n\nThe similarities, such as the babies being of similar age, dying at similar times of the day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone, would be expected if Jane had intentionally caused the deaths of both children.\n\nIn a case where a person intentionally harms or kills their children, it is common for the method of harm to be similar across multiple incidents, and for the circumstances surrounding the incidents to be alike. This can be due to the perpetrator following a similar pattern or modus operandi.\n\nGiven the evidence of injuries and haemorrhages found in the second son's autopsy, and the subsequent discovery of additional injuries in the first son's autopsy, the likelihood of these similarities occurring if Jane is guilty is extremely high.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe findings of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages are typically associated with violent trauma, such as smothering, which would be inconsistent with a natural or accidental death. These types of injuries are not commonly seen in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS occurrences (1 in 4,000 in the UK) and the improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, the presence of these specific injuries in Ben's autopsy significantly reduces the likelihood of Jane's innocence.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high.\n\nThe findings of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben's autopsy are highly consistent with the act of smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be expected if Jane intentionally caused the death of her second child.\n\nThe presence of these specific injuries, along with the additional injuries found in the first son's autopsy upon further investigation, strongly suggests a pattern of intentional harm and a modus operandi used by the perpetrator.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have occurred a few hours before death is concerning, as it suggests a deliberate and recent act of harm, rather than a natural or accidental cause.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, the presence of this specific type of injury with a relatively short timeline is highly unlikely to have occurred naturally or accidentally if Jane is not guilty.\n\nThe timing of the injury, as described by the doctor, points more towards an intentional act of harm, rather than a natural or unexpected event.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have occurred a few hours before death is highly consistent with an intentional act of harm, such as smothering, committed by the perpetrator.\n\nIn cases where a caregiver intentionally causes harm to a child, the injuries are often inflicted relatively close to the time of death, as the perpetrator aims to cover up their actions and avoid detection.\n\nGiven the other evidence, such as the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children and the additional injuries found in the first son's autopsy, the timeline provided by the doctor aligns with the pattern of a deliberate and recent act of violence if Jane is guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low.\n\nThe findings of these specific injuries, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, would be highly unlikely to occur in a natural or accidental death, particularly in a case of SIDS.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS occurrences and the improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, the presence of these types of injuries in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy significantly reduces the likelihood of Jane's innocence.\n\nThese findings, combined with the evidence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben's case, strongly suggest a pattern of intentional harm rather than natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high.\n\nThe findings of these specific injuries, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, are highly consistent with a pattern of intentional harm if Jane is the perpetrator.\n\nThe discovery of these injuries in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy, in addition to the evidence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben's case, suggests a modus operandi used by the perpetrator to harm both children.\n\nThe similarity of the injuries across the two incidents, as well as the timing of the deaths, would be expected if Jane is guilty and has intentionally caused the deaths of both of her children.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe explanation that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were caused by the resuscitation efforts is plausible, as these types of injuries are commonly seen in attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\n\nGiven that the initial autopsy had concluded Andy's death was due to natural causes, the re-examination findings that identified these injuries could reasonably be attributed to the resuscitation attempts, rather than an indication of abuse or smothering.\n\nWithout stronger evidence to the contrary, and considering the rarity of SIDS, it is more likely that the injuries in Andy's case were the result of the medical intervention to save his life, rather than a sign of intentional harm if Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is low.\n\nThe presence of the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are characteristic of smothering, would be more consistent with a pattern of intentional harm rather than injuries sustained during resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies, the time of day, and Jane being alone with the children, the discovery of these specific injuries in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy suggests a modus operandi used by the perpetrator.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the explanation that these injuries were caused by resuscitation attempts is less likely, as the evidence points towards a deliberate course of action resulting in the deaths of both children.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is relatively high.\n\nPetechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering or asphyxiation, as they are caused by the burst capillaries due to the increased pressure during the suffocation process.\n\nHowever, the absence of such typical smothering injuries in Ben's case, despite the presence of other injuries like hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, suggests that the cause of death may not have been solely due to smothering.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, the lack of petechiae or other classic smothering injuries, in addition to the other evidence, increases the likelihood that Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is relatively low.\n\nThe presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben's autopsy is highly indicative of smothering or asphyxiation, which typically results in the appearance of petechiae or other classic signs of suffocation.\n\nThe absence of these typical smothering injuries, despite the other evidence of harm, suggests that the perpetrator may have used a different method or technique to cause Ben's death, or that the autopsy failed to detect these injuries.\n\nGiven the similarities between the two incidents and the pattern of intentional harm suggested by the other evidence, the lack of petechiae or other classic smothering injuries in Ben's case would be less likely if Jane is guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe medical examiner's assessment that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and that the dislocated ribs were likely caused post-mortem or during resuscitation efforts, provides a plausible explanation for these injuries if Jane is not guilty.\n\nThese findings, unlike the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are not typically associated with intentional harm or smothering. Their presence in the autopsy results can be reasonably attributed to natural causes or the medical intervention, rather than an indication of foul play.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, the medical examiner's assessment of these specific injuries increases the likelihood that Jane is not guilty of the charges.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nWhile the medical examiner's assessment of these specific injuries may be plausible in isolation, the overall evidence in the case points to a pattern of intentional harm if Jane is the perpetrator.\n\nThe presence of the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, which are characteristic of smothering or asphyxiation, along with the similarities between the two incidents, suggest a modus operandi used by the perpetrator.\n\nIn such a scenario, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs may have been caused by the same intentional act that led to the other injuries, rather than being the result of natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the other evidence of deliberate harm, the medical examiner's assessment of these specific injuries becomes less compelling if Jane is guilty of the charges.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n35%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note the injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that these injuries may have developed or become more apparent later on.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and the deaths of both children were due to natural causes or SIDS, the lack of observed injuries upon the initial hospital admission increases the probability that the findings during the autopsy were not present at that time.\n\nThis would be consistent with a scenario where the injuries were either not yet visible, or developed after the initial medical examination, rather than being present when Ben was brought in.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nGiven the evidence suggesting a pattern of intentional harm, it is more likely that the injuries observed during the autopsy, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, were present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, but were not detected or properly documented by the nurses.\n\nIf Jane is the perpetrator, she may have intentionally concealed or minimized the appearance of the injuries to avoid suspicion and detection. The lack of observed injuries upon the initial hospital admission would be less plausible if Jane is guilty of causing harm to her child.\n\nThe overall evidence, including the similarities between the two incidents and the findings in the autopsies, points to a scenario where the injuries were likely present but overlooked or downplayed when Ben was brought to the hospital, rather than developing later on.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the two counts of murder is:\n\n75%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
