  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is quite low. The evidence suggests that the brain damage was a result of suffocation or smothering, which is inconsistent with SIDS. SIDS typically does not involve injuries or trauma to the body.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Jane's first son, Andy, also died under suspicious circumstances, with evidence of bruises and other injuries, further weakens the possibility that the deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very low.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Jane suffocated or smothered both of her children, leading to their deaths. The injuries and trauma found during the autopsies, including the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, are consistent with this method of murder.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was most likely caused by Jane's actions shortly before his death, rather than due to natural causes or SIDS.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is quite high.\n\nThe fact that both babies were about the same age, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could simply be a coincidence. These are common occurrences that may happen in cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is more prevalent in young infants.\n\nThe similarities do not necessarily imply that Jane is guilty of murdering her children. SIDS is a tragic and unpredictable event, and the presence of these similarities alone does not provide conclusive evidence of foul play.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is quite high.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe fact that both babies were about the same age, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, strongly suggests a pattern of behavior. These similarities are highly unlikely to occur by chance, especially given the tragic outcome in both cases.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering her children, she likely followed a similar modus operandi in both incidents, leading to the observed similarities. The similarities would serve to support the prosecution's case and provide evidence of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low.\n\nThe presence of these injuries and physical findings is more characteristic of smothering or other forms of abuse, rather than natural causes or SIDS. While it is possible for some minor injuries to occur in infants due to natural causes, the combination of these specific findings is highly suggestive of non-accidental trauma.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then the explanation for these injuries would need to be accounted for by an alternative scenario, such as an unintentional accident or a medical condition. However, the medical evidence seems to point more towards intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high.\n\nThe presence of these specific injuries and physical findings is highly characteristic of smothering or other forms of intentional harm to the infant. These types of injuries are not typically seen in cases of natural causes or SIDS.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering her children, then the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death would be consistent with her actions of smothering or suffocating the baby. These injuries provide strong evidence to support the prosecution's case against Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe specific injuries found during the autopsy, including the hypoxic damage to the brain and the eye/eyelid haemorrhages, are more indicative of smothering or other intentional trauma, rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then an alternative explanation would be needed to account for these severe injuries. While it is possible that they could have occurred due to unintentional circumstances, the medical evidence points more towards intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\n20%",

These types of injuries are not typically seen in cases of natural causes or SIDS.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering her child, Ben, then the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages would be consistent with her actions of suffocating or violently harming the infant. These injuries provide strong evidence to support the prosecution's case against Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note any injuries when Ben was admitted suggests that the severe injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, likely occurred sometime after he was brought to the hospital, rather than before.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it would be reasonable to assume that the injuries were either missed by the initial medical examination or developed later due to medical complications or unintentional causes. The absence of observed injuries upon admission makes it more plausible that the injuries were not present at that time.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very low.\n\nGiven the evidence that the injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are consistent with smothering or other intentional trauma, it is highly unlikely that these injuries would have developed after Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering her son, Ben, she most likely inflicted these severe injuries on him prior to bringing him to the hospital. The lack of observed injuries upon admission suggests that Jane may have concealed or hidden the evidence of her actions.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very low.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe initial assessment that the injuries, such as the bruises and torn frenulum, were caused by the resuscitation efforts is a plausible explanation. These types of injuries are commonly seen in cases where medical professionals have to perform CPR and other life-saving measures on infants, especially when the child is in a fragile state.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then there is no reason to suspect that the injuries were caused by any intentional harm. The medical professionals who tried to revive Andy would be the most likely source of these injuries, rather than any wrongdoing on Jane's part.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, in addition to the later findings of other injuries, suggests a pattern of intentional harm rather than accidental or medically-induced trauma.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the injuries found in Andy's case are more likely to be the result of her actions, such as smothering or other forms of abuse, rather than simply being due to resuscitation efforts.\n\nThe medical evidence, when considered in the context of Jane's potential guilt, points more towards intentional harm as the cause of Andy's injuries, rather than an innocent explanation related to the resuscitation attempts.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high.\n\nThe absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, suggests that the cause of Ben's death may not have been due to intentional suffocation or asphyxiation.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then the hypoxic damage and other injuries found in Ben's case could have alternative explanations, such as an underlying medical condition or SIDS, which may not necessarily produce the full range of expected injuries from smothering.\n\nThe lack of petechiae and other typical smothering injuries makes it more plausible that Ben's death was not the result of intentional harm, if Jane is indeed not guilty of the alleged crimes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high.\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low.\n\nThe presence of other severe injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, suggests that Ben's death was likely due to intentional suffocation or asphyxiation. The absence of typical smothering injuries, like petechiae, would be unusual if Jane is indeed guilty of murdering her son.\n\nPetechiae are commonly associated with smothering or strangulation, as they are caused by the burst capillaries in the skin due to the lack of oxygen. The fact that they were not found, despite the other evidence of trauma, raises questions about the completeness or accuracy of the medical examination.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the lack of petechiae and other typical smothering injuries would be unexpected and less likely, as the overall evidence points to intentional harm as the cause of Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben is quite high.\n\nThe medical evidence indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred either post-mortem or due to the resuscitation attempts. These injuries do not necessarily point to intentional harm or foul play.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then the cause of Ben's death was likely due to natural causes or SIDS, which would be consistent with the medical examiner's findings regarding the spinal bleeding and rib injuries. These findings do not provide strong evidence of Jane's involvement in Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is quite high.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is relatively low.\n\nThe medical evidence indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred either post-mortem or due to the resuscitation attempts. However, if Jane is guilty of intentionally harming or smothering Ben, these injuries may not fully align with the manner of death.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the presence of the more severe injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, would be expected to be the primary cause of Ben's death, rather than the spinal bleeding or rib dislocations. These latter injuries may not be as consistent with a deliberate act of suffocation or intentional trauma.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is relatively low.\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is quite high.\n\nThe key factors that contribute to this assessment are:\n- The similarities between the two incidents, including the ages of the babies, the timing of the deaths, and Jane being alone with the children when they became unconscious.\n- The medical evidence of injuries, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and hypoxic damage, which are highly characteristic of smothering or intentional harm.\n- The lack of a clear alternative explanation for the injuries and deaths, especially given the recurrence of these tragic events.\n- The improbability of the injuries and similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty.\n\nTaking all of this evidence into account, the probability that Jane is guilty of murdering her two children is quite high.\n\n80%",
  "Based on the evidence provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
