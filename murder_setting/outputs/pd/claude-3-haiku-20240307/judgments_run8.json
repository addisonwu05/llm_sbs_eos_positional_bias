  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the presence of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death is highly unlikely.\n\nThe characteristics mentioned are more indicative of abuse and smothering, rather than SIDS, which is typically sudden and unexplainable. SIDS is not typically associated with such physical injuries.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these findings would be present in a SIDS case, if Jane is not guilty, is very low.\n\n20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents, such as the babies being of similar age, dying at similar times of day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are somewhat likely.\n\nIn the case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), it is not uncommon for there to be similarities between incidents, as SIDS can occur under similar circumstances, particularly regarding the age of the infants and the time of day.\n\nHowever, the combination of these similarities, along with the other evidence suggesting potential abuse, makes it less likely that these similarities would occur if Jane is truly not guilty.\n\n60",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is moderately likely.\n\nIn cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), there can be a period of hypoxia (low oxygen) that occurs shortly before the death, which can lead to brain damage. This is not necessarily indicative of intentional harm, but rather a complication of the sudden and unexplained nature of SIDS.\n\nGiven the other factors involved, such as the lack of clear evidence of abuse, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is not certain, but is reasonably likely if Jane is truly not guilty.\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her child, the hypoxic damage to the brain would be the result of the perpetrator's actions, likely occurring shortly before the child's death. This would be consistent with a deliberate act of suffocation or deprivation of oxygen, rather than a sudden and unexplained event like SIDS.\n\nGiven the other evidence of potential abuse, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is very high if Jane is indeed guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is low.\n\nThe described injuries are highly indicative of smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be inconsistent with a sudden, unexplained death like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is not typically associated with such specific physical injuries.\n\nGiven the context that Jane is not guilty, the probability that these severe injuries would be present is low, as they would be more likely to occur in a scenario of intentional harm rather than a natural, unexplained death.\n\n20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is moderately likely.\n\nIn cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the sudden and unexplained nature of the death may not always result in the presence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae. The lack of these specific injuries does not necessarily rule out SIDS as the cause of death.\n\nGiven the context that Jane is not guilty, the probability that Ben's death would not have the full range of smothering-related injuries is reasonably high, as the absence of these injuries would be more consistent with a natural, unexplained death rather than intentional harm.\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is unlikely.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of intentionally smothering or harming her child, the typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be expected to be present.

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is high.\n\nIn cases where a baby's death is sudden and unexplained, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the initial injuries observed during resuscitation attempts would be expected to be present. These types of injuries, including bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are commonly seen as a result of the vigorous efforts to revive the infant.\n\nGiven the context that Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case are attributable to the resuscitation attempts, rather than any intentional harm, is quite high.\n\n80",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely the result of post-mortem changes or resuscitation efforts.

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very high.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death is due to natural causes or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the injuries observed during the autopsy would not have been present or visible when he was initially brought to the hospital. The medical staff would not have noted these injuries at that time.\n\nThe absence of the injuries being observed by the nurses upon Ben's arrival to the hospital is much more consistent with a natural, unexpected death, rather than one involving intentional harm.
