  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that both children died from natural causes, with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) being the alternative explanation provided. We must, for the purpose of answering this conditional question, set aside the strong forensic evidence of injuries that typically contradict a SIDS diagnosis. We are asked to determine the likelihood of the observed similarities if both deaths were indeed SIDS.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of each similarity occurring in the context of two SIDS deaths:\n\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died (Andy: 11 weeks, Ben: 8 weeks):** SIDS has a peak incidence between 2 and 4 months (8 to 16 weeks). Both ages fall squarely within this peak window. Therefore, it is quite probable for two SIDS deaths in a family to occur around these ages. Let's estimate this probability as **0.5** (reasonable, as not all SIDS deaths occur in this narrow window, and for two independent events to occur so close in age is still a coincidence, though common for SIDS).\n\n2.  **Both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed:** SIDS deaths often occur during sleep, and infants are frequently put to sleep after feeding. This is consistent with typical SIDS occurrences. Let's estimate this probability as **0.5** (similar to age, it's common for SIDS, but for two distinct events to have such similar timing is still a specific coincidence).\n\n3.  **Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** This is the most crucial and suspicious similarity if the deaths were natural.\n    *   For a single SIDS death, it's common for a parent to be alone when finding the baby.\n    *   However, for *two* SIDS deaths, for the *same* parent to be alone with *both* children when they are found unresponsive, this is a strong circumstantial similarity.\n    *   If we assume Jane and Frank share childcare responsibilities somewhat, or Frank is sometimes home, then the probability of Jane being alone with the child at the moment of discovery for *each* SIDS event is not 1.\n    *   Let's consider the probability of Jane being alone when a baby is found unresponsive by natural causes. If Jane and Frank are equally likely to be alone with the child at the critical time, the probability of Jane being alone is 0.5. For this to happen twice, independently, the probability would be 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n    *   If Jane is the primary caregiver and is alone with the children more often (e.g., 70% of the time), then the probability of her being alone twice would be 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.\n\nThe problem states that \"The similarities between both incidents are astonishing.\" This implies that the overall probability of these similarities, even if Jane is not guilty, should be low. The \"astonishing\" nature would typically correspond to a single-digit percentage.\n\nLet's use the more conservative estimate for Jane being alone twice, which contributes to the \"astonishing\" quality of the similarities. If we take the 0.25 probability for Jane being alone twice (assuming roughly equal chance for either parent to be alone if SIDS occurs), and combine it with the probabilities for the other similarities:\n\nP(Similarities | Jane is NOT GUILTY) = P(Age Similarity) * P(Time of Day/Feeding Similarity) * P(Jane Alone Twice)\nP(Similarities | Jane is NOT GUILTY) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nThis calculation yields a probability of approximately 6.25%. This value is low enough to be considered \"astonishing\" in a legal context, particularly when viewed alongside the extreme rarity of two SIDS deaths in one family (even though we're conditioning on the \"not guilty\" premise).\n\n6",
