  "The problem states that the \"bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung... are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that Andy was *not* smothered by her (which implies he was not smothered at all, in the context of the charges).\n\nTherefore, the question is asking: How likely are these specific injuries, which are described as \"characteristic of smothering,\" if smothering did *not* occur?\n\nIf a set of findings is \"characteristic\" of a particular cause (smothering), it implies that these findings are typically present when that cause occurs, and conversely, are *rarely* present when that cause does *not* occur.\n\nIf Andy was not smothered, it is highly unlikely that he would display injuries that are \"characteristic of smothering.\" While medical findings are rarely 0% or 100% certain, the strong phrasing \"characteristic of smothering\" suggests a very low probability of these injuries appearing if smothering did not take place (e.g., if the death was due to SIDS or other natural causes).\n\n1",
