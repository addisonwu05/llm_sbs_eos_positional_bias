Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The case presents Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as an alternative explanation for the deaths if Jane is innocent.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of \"hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\" *if Jane is NOT GUILTY*.\n\nThese specific findings – hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids (especially when combined with rib and spinal cord injuries as mentioned in the broader context of Ben's autopsy) – are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" This implies that these injuries are indicators of trauma, often associated with non-accidental injury or asphyxia.\n\nSIDS, by definition, is a \"sudden and unexplainable death\" where \"no clear mechanism or cause has been identified.\" Crucially, SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is only considered when all other causes of death, including trauma, have been ruled out. The presence of specific traumatic injuries like hypoxic damage, retinal hemorrhages, and other internal injuries typically rules out a diagnosis of SIDS. These are not findings associated with natural causes or SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it would imply that Ben's death was due to natural causes, such as SIDS, or some other non-violent event not caused by Jane. In such a scenario (death by SIDS or natural causes), the likelihood of finding injuries that are highly indicative of violent trauma (and inconsistent with SIDS) is extremely low. It would be an exceedingly rare or unprecedented occurrence for these specific traumatic findings to be present in a death genuinely due to SIDS or other natural causes.\n\n1"

The doctor alleged that this damage \"must have been caused a matter of hours before death.\"\n\nRegardless of the ultimate cause of death (violent trauma or natural causes like SIDS), if an infant experiences severe hypoxic brain damage that is part of the fatal event, that damage would necessarily occur in the final, acute stages of life. Fatal hypoxia is an immediate precursor to death. It is highly improbable for \"hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain\" (of a severity linked to the death) to have occurred days or weeks before death, with the child subsequently dying \"unwell\" but from natural causes that same day.\n\nTherefore, whether the hypoxia was caused by violent trauma (if Jane were guilty) or by a natural terminal event like the acute cardiorespiratory failure characteristic of SIDS (if Jane is not guilty), the period of severe oxygen deprivation leading to such brain damage and death would occur very close to the time of death – \"a matter of hours before death\" is a medically consistent timeframe for such an acute terminal event.\n\n95"

The question asks how likely it is to observe the specified similarities between the two incidents *given* that Jane is not guilty.\n\nThe similarities are:\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks):** SIDS has a peak incidence between 2 and 4 months (8 to 16 weeks). If two infants die from SIDS, it is quite likely they would fall within this age range.\n2.  **They both died at similar times of the day after just being fed:** SIDS often occurs during sleep, and infants are typically put down to sleep after feeding. This is a common pattern for SIDS deaths and reflects typical infant routines.\n3.  **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** If Jane is the primary caregiver, and these incidents occurred during typical sleep times when she would be alone with the children (e.g., spouse at work, or during the night while others sleep), then it is plausible that she would be the one to discover the child on both occasions.\n\nHowever, the prompt explicitly states that \"The similarities between both incidents are astonishing.\" In legal and forensic contexts, when such a striking pattern of similarities occurs in two infant deaths attributed to the same caregiver, especially when the caregiver is alone, it is generally considered to be highly improbable if the deaths were purely natural and coincidental. The term \"astonishing\" implies that such a coincidence is highly unlikely. While each similarity might individually be plausible for a SIDS death, the combination and repetition of these specific circumstances are often seen as statistically very improbable for natural causes. This perceived low probability is precisely why these similarities are highlighted as significant in a criminal case.\n\nTherefore, to reflect the \"astonishing\" nature of these similarities *if Jane is NOT GUILTY* (i.e., if the deaths were natural and coincidental), the probability must be judged as very low.\n\n5"

This implies that while they are often observed in smothering cases, their presence is not universal, nor is their absence impossible. However, if an injury is \"typical,\" it means it occurs in a majority of cases. Therefore, the *absence* of a typical injury would be less likely than its presence, but still possible.\n\nMedical and forensic literature confirms that petechiae are not present in 100% of smothering or asphyxial deaths. The proportion can vary, but it's generally accepted that a significant minority of cases (e.g., 20-40% or more, depending on various factors) may not exhibit petechiae even when smothering has occurred.\n\nGiven that petechiae are \"typical\" (suggesting presence in more than 50% of cases), their absence would be less likely than their presence.

The problem text itself labels these similarities as \"astonishing,\" implying that such a coincidence in two natural SIDS deaths in the same family is highly improbable.\n\n**Evidence that might weaken the case for guilt or support alternative explanations:**\n\n1.  **Absence of Petechiae in Ben:** \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" While petechiae are typical, their absence does not definitively rule out smothering, as they are not present in all cases. This offers a minor point against guilt.\n2.  **Ben's Injuries Not Noted by Nurses:** \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If \"not noted\" implies \"not present,\" this would be a very strong point against guilt. However, \"not noted\" often means they were not externally obvious or documented during an emergency, which is plausible even if injuries (especially internal ones like brain hypoxia or subtle rib fractures) were present.\n3.  **Andy's Initial Autopsy/Resuscitation Explanations:** Andy's initial post-mortem \"suggested natural causes of death,\" and some injuries \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts.\" Also, for Ben, \"spinal bleeding... is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" These points provide alternative, non-abusive explanations for *some* findings. However, these alternative explanations do not cover all the specific traumatic injuries (e.g., Andy's torn frenulum or Ben's eye hemorrhages and brain hypoxia), and Andy's initial autopsy was superseded by re-examination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe core evidence of specific, multiple, and forensically significant traumatic injuries found in *both* children, explicitly linked to abuse and smothering, combined with the \"astonishing\" and highly improbable similarities in the circumstances of two infant deaths, provides extremely strong evidence of guilt. While some points might introduce minor doubt or offer alternative explanations for *some* findings, they do not sufficiently counter the overwhelming weight of the direct evidence of trauma in two separate incidents. The extremely low probability of observing these combined traumatic findings and circumstances in two natural SIDS deaths makes guilt highly probable.\n\n99"
