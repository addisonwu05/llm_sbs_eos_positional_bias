Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

SIDS peaks between 2-4 months, so both deaths occurring in this window (8-11 weeks) aligns with SIDS risk periods.\n- Similar time of day: SIDS deaths often occur during sleep periods after feeding, which follow predictable patterns in infant care routines.\n- Being found by Jane while alone: This could simply reflect typical childcare arrangements where Jane was the primary caregiver.\n- Genetic factors: Siblings might share genetic vulnerabilities that predispose them to similar medical issues.\n\nHowever, the physical evidence is concerning:\n- The second child had rib and spinal injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and eye hemorrhages - findings consistent with trauma.\n- Reexamination of the first child found bruises and lung blood, which could indicate trauma rather than natural death.\n\nWhile SIDS occurs in about 1 in 4,000 births, the probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family would be much rarer - approximately 1 in 16 million. The additional physical trauma evidence further reduces the likelihood these were natural deaths.\n\nGiven the combination of suspicious physical findings and the extreme rarity of double SIDS deaths, the similarities would be quite unlikely if Jane were not guilty.\n\n55"

These specific injury patterns (particularly the torn frenulum, hypoxic damage with eye hemorrhages) are highly characteristic of smothering and have few innocent explanations. The statistical improbability of two natural deaths with these specific findings is extremely significant.\n\nWhile some individual findings might have alternative explanations, the complete pattern forms a coherent picture that aligns with the prosecution's theory. The similar circumstances of both deaths further strengthens the case.\n\nBased on the medical evidence presented and the extraordinary coincidence required for an innocent explanation, I assess the probability of guilt at:\n\n90"
