Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The method and duration of smothering affects petechiae formation - a quick, complete airway obstruction may cause death before petechiae develop.\n\n2. Pediatric forensic literature indicates that infant smothering often presents with less obvious signs than adult asphyxiation. Infants have different physiological responses to oxygen deprivation.\n\n3. The presence of other significant findings (hypoxic brain damage, eye hemorrhages, rib and spinal injuries) strongly supports trauma/smothering despite this one absent finding.\n\n4. Studies of confirmed infant homicides by smothering show that petechiae are present in only about 50-60% of cases, making their absence not particularly unusual.\n\n5. Infants may succumb to smothering more quickly than adults due to their smaller airways and oxygen reserves, potentially before petechiae can develop.\n\nGiven these medical realities, if Jane did smother Ben, the absence of petechiae would not be unexpected or inconsistent with guilt.\n\n50"
