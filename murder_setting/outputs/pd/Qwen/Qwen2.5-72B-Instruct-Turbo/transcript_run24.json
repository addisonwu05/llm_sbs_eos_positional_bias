Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, the specific and striking similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the infants, the time of day, and the circumstances under which they were found, are highly unusual and statistically unlikely to occur by chance alone.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the specific conditions that matched in both cases, it is important to consider the statistical improbability of these events happening independently and coincidentally. SIDS, while a known occurrence, is relatively rare, and the additional specific similarities in the two cases add layers of improbability.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach this with a balanced view, recognizing that while the similarities are striking, they do not definitively prove guilt. The legal system requires a high standard of proof, and the defense would likely argue that these similarities, while unusual, do not rule out the possibility of a natural cause.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, the probability that these similarities would occur by chance if Jane is not guilty is very low.
