  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis of the circumstances, injuries, and likelihoods, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability that the deaths of Andy and Ben were the result of deliberate actions, as supported by the specific and consistent injuries found in both children, the unusual patterns of the incidents, and the low likelihood of these events occurring naturally or by coincidence."
