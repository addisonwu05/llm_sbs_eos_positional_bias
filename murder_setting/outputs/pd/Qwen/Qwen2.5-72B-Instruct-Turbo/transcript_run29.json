Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Given the context, one of the possible explanations for the hypoxic damage is sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which can indeed cause hypoxic brain damage. However, SIDS is typically not associated with a specific time frame for the hypoxic injury; it can occur over a period of time, but it often results in sudden and unexpected death.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death is more consistent with active smothering, as it would lead to a rapid onset of hypoxia and subsequent brain damage. If Jane is not guilty, other natural causes, including SIDS, would be more plausible, but these causes are less likely to result in such a temporally specific injury.\n\nGiven the information and the rarity of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low, as it is more likely to have occurred over a broader time frame or due to a different mechanism.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30"
