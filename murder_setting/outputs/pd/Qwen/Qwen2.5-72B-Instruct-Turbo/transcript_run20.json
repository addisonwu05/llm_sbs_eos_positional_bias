Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Petechiae can sometimes fade or be less noticeable after death.\n\n4. **Other Injuries**: The presence of other injuries such as hypoxic damage, rib and spinal cord injuries, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are more indicative of smothering and can still support the hypothesis that Ben was smothered, even in the absence of petechiae.\n\nGiven these factors, the absence of petechiae in Ben is less likely but still possible if Jane is guilty.

This high degree of similarity is less likely to be a coincidence if Jane is not guilty.\n\n2. **Injuries in Ben**: The hypoxic damage, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, rib and spinal cord injuries in Ben are strongly consistent with smothering or other forms of violent trauma. The absence of petechiae does not rule out smothering, given the variability in the presentation of these injuries.\n\n3. **Injuries in Andy**: The bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy are also consistent with smothering or abuse. While these injuries could be attributed to resuscitation efforts, the combination of injuries is more indicative of deliberate harm.\n\n4. **Post-Mortem Findings**: The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben can be explained by natural causes or post-mortem factors, but the other injuries are more specific to abuse.\n\n5. **Statistical Rarity**: The rarity of two SIDS deaths in the same family, combined with the specific and unusual circumstances, makes a natural explanation less likely.\n\n6. **Behavioral Consistency**: If Jane is guilty, the consistency in the method and timing of the deaths is more easily explained by a pattern of behavior.\n\nGiven the strong consistency of the injuries with smothering and the high degree of similarity in the circumstances of both deaths, the probability that Jane is guilty is relatively high.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the probability judgment that Jane is guilty is approximately 80.\n\n80"
