  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the key points, my verdict for the defendant is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability that the defendant, Jane, is responsible for the deaths of her children, Andy and Ben, due to the consistent and compelling evidence of non-accidental trauma and the unusual similarities in the circumstances of both deaths."
