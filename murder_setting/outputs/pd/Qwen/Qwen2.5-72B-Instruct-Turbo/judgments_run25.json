  "Based on the evidence provided and the analysis of the circumstances, the injuries, and the patterns observed, my verdict is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability (85%) that Jane is responsible for the deaths of her children, given the strong evidence suggesting deliberate actions and the highly suspicious circumstances surrounding both deaths."
