  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the injuries and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Andy and Ben, the probability that Jane is guilty is high. However, the final verdict in a legal context should be made by a jury or judge based on the standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nGiven the strong evidence of non-accidental trauma and the specific injuries found in both infants, my assessment leads me to conclude:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis verdict is based on the high probability that the injuries and circumstances are consistent with deliberate actions, but it is important to note that the legal system requires a thorough and fair evaluation of all evidence."
