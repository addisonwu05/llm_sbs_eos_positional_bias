Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

For example, a fall or an accidental injury during routine care might have caused the bruises and other injuries without Jane intending any harm.\n\n2. **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions or disorders can cause symptoms that mimic those of abuse. For example, some rare genetic disorders or bleeding disorders can lead to bruising and internal bleeding.\n\n3. **SIDS**: While SIDS is generally considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion, it is still a possibility. SIDS can sometimes present with signs of trauma, such as bruising, due to the infant's struggle before death.\n\n4. **Post-Mortem Artifacts**: Some injuries might be post-mortem artifacts, meaning they occurred after the infant's death, during the handling of the body or the autopsy process.\n\nHowever, the combination of these specific injuries, particularly the torn frenulum and blood in the lungs, is highly indicative of non-accidental trauma, such as smothering.

These injuries are highly consistent with smothering or other forms of non-accidental trauma.\n\n3. **Injuries to Ben**: Ben's body showed hypoxic damage to the brain, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and other injuries that are characteristic of smothering. The hypoxic damage was determined to have occurred a matter of hours before death, which is consistent with a deliberate act.\n\n4. **Spinal Bleeding and Dislocated Ribs**: While spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths and dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation, these findings are less specific to intentional harm and do not significantly alter the overall assessment.\n\n5. **Absence of Petechiae**: The absence of petechiae in Ben, while less typical in smothering cases, does not rule out the possibility of smothering. The variability in the presence of petechiae and other individual factors can explain this absence.\n\n6. **Pattern of Behavior**: The consistent pattern of both incidents, with Jane being alone with the infants when they were found unconscious, strongly suggests a deliberate and repeated act.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty. However, it is important to note that the final determination should be made by a court based on all the evidence and legal standards.\n\nThe probability that Jane is guilty is estimated to be **85**.\n\n85"
