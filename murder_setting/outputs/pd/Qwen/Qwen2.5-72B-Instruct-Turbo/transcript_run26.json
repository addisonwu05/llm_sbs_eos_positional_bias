Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The coincidence of both deaths occurring at a similar age, shortly after feeding, and when Jane was alone with them, can be statistically quite improbable, but not impossible. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a known, albeit rare, phenomenon, and while the statistical frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000, the probability of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family is extremely low.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider that SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other possible causes of death, including foul play, must be thoroughly investigated and ruled out before a diagnosis of SIDS can be made. The presence of physical injuries and hypoxic damage in Ben, as well as the subsequent findings in Andy, complicates the case further and makes it even less likely that both deaths were due to SIDS.\n\nGiven the specific and unusual similarities in the circumstances of both deaths, and the presence of injuries, the probability that these similarities would occur by chance if Jane is not guilty is very low. However, without definitive proof, it is not impossible, and the legal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" must be considered.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance is estimated to be **1%**. 1"
