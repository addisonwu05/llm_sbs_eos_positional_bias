Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The exact mechanisms that lead to SIDS are not fully understood, but it can involve a combination of factors such as sleep environment, brain abnormalities, and respiratory issues. Hypoxic damage can occur rapidly in SIDS cases, and it is plausible that such damage could have occurred a matter of hours before death.\n\n2. **Natural Causes**: Other natural causes, such as infections (e.g., respiratory infections), metabolic disorders, or congenital abnormalities, can also lead to hypoxic damage. These conditions can deteriorate quickly, resulting in significant brain damage in a short period.\n\n3. **Accidental Suffocation**: Accidental suffocation, which can occur if an infant is placed in an unsafe sleeping environment (e.g., with soft bedding or in a prone position), can also lead to hypoxic damage in a matter of hours.\n\nGiven these possibilities, it is reasonable to consider that the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain could have occurred a matter of hours before his death even if Jane is not guilty.

In the context of other injuries, the spinal bleeding is more likely to be trauma-related.\n\n2. **Dislocated Ribs**: Dislocated ribs can occur during resuscitation efforts, but they can also be the result of physical trauma. Given the presence of other injuries, the dislocated ribs are more likely to be related to a violent act rather than natural causes or post-mortem changes.\n\n3. **Combination of Injuries**: The combination of spinal bleeding, dislocated ribs, hypoxic damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is more consistent with a pattern of deliberate harm. Each of these injuries, when considered together, suggests a higher likelihood of violence rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is less likely to be due to natural causes or post-mortem changes if Jane is guilty.\n\nConsidering the above points, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is guilty is estimated to be **30**.\n\n30"

Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Similarities in Incidents**: Both Andy and Ben died at similar ages, after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities are highly unusual and raise suspicion.\n\n2. **Injuries in Andy**: The bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lungs in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation, but their presence is more consistent with deliberate harm, especially in light of the subsequent findings in Ben.\n\n3. **Injuries in Ben**: The hypoxic damage to the brain, hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the timing of the hypoxic damage are strongly indicative of smothering or other violent trauma. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, while potentially explainable by natural causes or resuscitation, are more consistent with trauma when considered in the context of the other injuries.\n\n4. **Absence of Petechiae**: The absence of petechiae in Ben is less likely to be a definitive indicator of guilt or innocence, but it does not rule out smothering, especially given the variability in the presentation of such injuries.\n\n5. **Natural Causes**: While SIDS and other natural causes can explain some of the findings, the combination of injuries and the consistent pattern in both incidents make natural causes less likely.\n\nGiven the cumulative evidence and the strong association of the injuries with deliberate harm, the probability that Jane is guilty is estimated to be **80**.\n\n80"
