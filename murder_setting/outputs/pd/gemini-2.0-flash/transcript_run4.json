Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is innocent, we need to consider the following:\n\n1.  **Approximate Age at Death:** Both babies died at a very young age (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is most common in the first few months of life. The fact that the deaths occurred at roughly the same age (within a few weeks of each other) in early infancy is somewhat notable.\n\n2.  **Time of Day and After Feeding:** Infants often die while sleeping after feeding regardless of the cause of death.\n\n3.  **Jane Being Alone:** This is the most crucial factor to consider from a coincidence standpoint. If the mother is always present at or shortly before the death of both children, this makes the scenario far less likely to be due to chance.\n\n4.  **SIDS base rate**: SIDS is statistically uncommon. The death of one child to SIDS is traumatic but plausible. The death of a second child to SIDS, in the same family, is highly unusual. While there are some genetic or environmental risk factors for SIDS, it would be very rare to have two children in the same family die of it.\n\nGiven the low base rate of SIDS, especially occurring twice in the same family, combined with the fact that Jane was alone with the children during both incidents, the probability of all these similarities happening by chance is low if she is not guilty.\n\nProbability: 1\n"
