Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "Let's consider the likelihood of these similarities arising purely by chance if Jane is innocent and the deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes. We need to assess how common each of the similarities is:\n\n*   **Similar age at death (11 weeks and 8 weeks):** SIDS is most common between 2 and 4 months of age. Both deaths falling within this timeframe makes this similarity moderately likely, perhaps around 40%.\n*   **Similar time of day after feeding:** Infant feeding schedules are generally consistent, meaning the time of day the baby is fed will be approximately the same, so dying soon after being fed on both occasions makes this similarity moderately likely, let's say about 50%.\n*   **Found unconscious by Jane when alone:** This depends on the parental setup. Since Jane was often alone with the babies, it's quite plausible she would be the one to discover them, given one parent has to find the baby, so this similarity is highly likely, say 70%.\n*   **Both were boys**: SIDS is slightly more common in boys, increasing the likelihood of this similarity, maybe 60%.\n*   **Both babies died:** Probability of a SIDS death is 1/4000, or 0.00025. Probability of two independent SIDS deaths is 0.00025*0.00025 = 0.0000000625. This means the probability of both babies dying of SIDS is extremely low, maybe only 1%.\n\nTo combine these probabilities, we can multiply them (assuming independence), but that results in a very very low probability, close to 0. However, independence might not apply in this case as many of these factors are intertwined.\n\nGiven the low baseline rate of SIDS, the multiple coincidences increase the suspicion that the deaths are not accidental. However, we are asked about the likelihood assuming Jane is NOT guilty. Therefore, these combined similarities happening *purely by chance* are still unlikely.\n\nWe're asked for a probability judgement. Given the very low probability based on SIDS alone and considering the other similar factors in play as moderately likely if we assume Jane is innocent, let's place the probability at 5.\n\n5\n"
