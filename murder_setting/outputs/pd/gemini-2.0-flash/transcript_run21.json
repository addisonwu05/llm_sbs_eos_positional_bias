Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The torn frenulum is harder to explain with this, but perhaps forceful feeding or a minor fall could have caused it given fragile tissues.\n*   **Inappropriate Resuscitation:** If Andy had some kind of medical emergency, attempts to resuscitate him, especially if performed incorrectly or forcefully, could have caused some bruising and potentially the torn frenulum. Blood in the lung is less likely from this scenario.\n*   **Accidental Trauma:** While the injuries are suggestive of abuse, it's remotely possible that Andy sustained them accidentally. A fall or other accidental injury, even if seemingly minor, could theoretically cause these findings in a very young infant.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Autopsy Findings:** There is also a small chance the autopsy findings were misinterpreted or that the correlation between the injuries and abuse is overstated in this particular case.
