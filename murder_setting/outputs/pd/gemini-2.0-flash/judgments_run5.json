  "Given that Jane is not guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would likely have another explanation. While these symptoms *are* consistent with smothering, they are not exclusively indicative of it. Other possibilities need to be considered, especially in the context of infant deaths.\n\nSince SIDS is a possibility, and there are other potential, less-clear causes for such symptoms in infants, it is unlikely these symptoms *guarantee* foul play if Jane is innocent. Therefore, it is not impossible, but less likely, that these symptoms would appear if Jane is innocent.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic damage to his brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be very likely, as these are stated to be consistent with that act.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would have to be explained by something other than abuse or smothering. While these are indicative of such, they are not conclusive. There could be other explanations related to a pre-existing medical condition or other form of accidental injury that wasn't noted in the initial report. The question states that it is unlikely, not impossible, that these signs indicate abuse.\n\n30\n",
  "Given that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, if Jane is guilty, it is highly likely these findings would be present.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the incidents would need to be explained by coincidence or some other shared factor unrelated to foul play by Jane. While the similarities are striking, SIDS is mentioned as a possibility, and it's mentioned the babies died at similar ages. Given the vulnerability of infants at a young age, and the fact that one child died of SIDS, and the other suffered similar trauma, the odds are still not negligible that those similarities occur even when she is innocent.\n\n25\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities in the incidents become much more probable. The similar age, time of day, and Jane's presence alone with the children strongly suggest a pattern of behavior, making the similarities highly likely.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, but Ben suffered hypoxic brain damage a matter of hours before death, it implies a rapid, acute event unrelated to Jane's actions. Given other possible causes for SIDS or similar unexplained infant death, it remains possible.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the doctor alleges the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death, then that statement supports the smothering theory, making it very likely to be true.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were not noted by nurses, it implies either the injuries were subtle and difficult to detect or occurred rapidly in the time between the incident and arrival at the hospital. However, the autopsy *did* reveal injuries, so it is less likely that there were absolutely no injuries when arriving to hospital.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of inflicting the injuries, it's still plausible that the injuries weren't immediately obvious to the nurses upon arrival at the hospital. Some internal injuries might not be readily apparent, or the focus might have been on resuscitation. Therefore, it's reasonably likely the injuries weren't noted right away, but it's not a certainty.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being explained by natural causes, post-mortem changes, or resuscitation attempts makes it very likely that those findings would be present.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs is still reasonably likely because the information states that the spinal bleeding is common in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation. Therefore, even if Jane inflicted other injuries, these particular findings would still be expected.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, then it is likely that those injuries were found on Andy.\n\n80\n",
  "Even if Jane is guilty of inflicting other injuries, the fact that these particular injuries are consistent with resuscitation means they would still likely be present on Andy's body. The attempts to revive Andy happened regardless of whether Jane committed a crime.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the death was due to other causes, it would be likely that the injuries typical of smothering, such as petechiae, would be absent. This aligns with an alternative explanation for the death.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the *absence* of typical signs of smothering, such as petechiae, makes it less certain she is guilty via that method. However, it is still possible she committed the crime and those specific indicators weren't present.\n\n35\n",
  "There's substantial evidence pointing towards Jane's guilt, particularly the similarities between the two deaths, the specific injuries found (or re-discovered) during the autopsies, and the doctor's claim of the hypoxic damage occurring just before death. However, there are counterarguments, such as the possibility of SIDS, the injuries potentially being caused by resuscitation, and the absence of some typical smothering signs. Balancing these conflicting points, it seems more likely than not that she is guilty, but there is also considerable uncertainty.\n\n70\n",
  "Based on the evidence presented, it is impossible to definitively state a verdict of guilty or not guilty. A legal verdict requires a standard of proof (e.g., beyond a reasonable doubt) that cannot be determined from the provided information alone. Therefore, I cannot state a verdict.\n"
