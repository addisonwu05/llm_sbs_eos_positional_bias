Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This is a highly simplified estimation, as we lack precise statistical data.\n\n*   **Similar Age at Death:** Andy died at 11 weeks, Ben at 8 weeks. While not exactly the same, they both fall within a sensitive period for infants. SIDS risk is highest between 1 and 4 months. The window of \"similar age\" is subjective, but we can say it's reasonably likely that two SIDS deaths would occur within a few weeks of each other. Let's estimate this at 30%.\n\n*   **Similar Time of Day After Feeding:** Babies often sleep after feeding, making this a high-risk time for SIDS events to be noticed. It is reasonable that SIDS would occur after feeding in both instances. Let's estimate this at 40%.\n\n*   **Found Unconscious by Jane While Alone:** This is the most crucial and potentially damning similarity. The fact that Jane was the sole caregiver present during both events is a major factor that contributes to suspicion. But if we assume innocence, it could simply be that Jane was the primary caregiver, and therefore most often alone with the babies. Let's assume a scenario where Jane spends 80% of her time alone with the babies. Therefore, the probability of this situation happening in each of the two cases, respectively, is 80%. So, the probability that this would happen in both cases by chance is 80% * 80% = 64%\n\nNow, we must combine these probabilities. This is tricky as we don't know if the events are independent. To simplify, we'll treat them as largely independent and multiply them, then scale the result to an integer.\nP(all similarities) = P(similar age) * P(similar time) * P(alone with Jane both times) = 0.30 * 0.40 * 0.64 = 0.0768\n\nThis result 0.0768 means that given the assumption that Jane is not guilty, there is a 7.68% chance of the listed similarities between the two incidents happening by pure chance. Scaled to an integer, this is 8%.\n\n8\n"

Let's re-evaluate each similarity:\n\n*   **Similar Age at Death:** A perpetrator might choose a vulnerable age range for both incidents. This reflects planning. The babies are likely to die in the same few weeks of age if the perpetrator is the same. We'll estimate this probability at 80%.\n\n*   **Similar Time of Day After Feeding:** This could be a strategic choice to mask the crime as SIDS. After feeding is a natural time for babies to be sleeping. This makes detection less likely.

The question becomes: how likely are these injuries to appear *without* intentional harm?\n\n*   **Bruises to arms and legs:** Infants can bruise relatively easily due to thin skin and developing bone structure. Accidental bumps and minor handling can cause bruises. However, extensive bruising is less common. Let's estimate a 5% chance of unexplained, *noticeable* bruising significant enough to be flagged on autopsy.\n\n*   **Torn Frenulum:** The frenulum (the small piece of tissue connecting the upper lip to the gums) can tear during feeding, crying, or even due to a fall. However, it's not an extremely common occurrence. Let's estimate a 3% chance of a tear significant enough to be noticed during autopsy without trauma.\n\n*   **Blood in the Lung:** Blood in the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage) can be caused by various factors, including infections, congenital heart defects, or even resuscitation efforts. Given a previously declared natural cause of death, we should focus on causes other than smothering. We'll estimate a 2% chance of significant blood in the lungs without trauma, which is significant enough to be found in the autopsy.\n\nNow we combine these probabilities. Again, independence is questionable, but it simplifies calculation:\n\nP(all injuries | not guilty) = P(bruises) * P(frenulum tear) * P(blood in lung) = 0.05 * 0.03 * 0.02 = 0.00003\nThis percentage represents a very rare event.

For the damage to occur hours prior, we need to consider other possibilities that aren't deliberate harm by Jane, but also aren't SIDS. These include:\n\n*   **Undiagnosed medical conditions:** Ben could have had an undiagnosed heart or respiratory condition that caused intermittent episodes of low oxygen levels hours before a final, fatal event (which could still be mistaken for SIDS).\n*   **Accidental airway obstruction:** While less likely given Jane's care, Ben could have experienced episodes of airway obstruction (e.g., from reflux, or positional asphyxia) during the hours leading up to his death, without Jane being aware.\n*   **Seizures:** Seizures can cause hypoxic brain damage, and in infants, can sometimes be difficult to detect.\n\nSince the doctor specifically stated that the damage occurred just *hours* before death, this cannot be explained by SIDS.
