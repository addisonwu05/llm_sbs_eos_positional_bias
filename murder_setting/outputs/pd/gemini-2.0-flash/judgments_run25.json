  "Given the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before Ben's death hinges on alternative explanations for his condition. SIDS is mentioned as a possibility, but the autopsy findings (rib and spinal cord injuries, haemorrhages) make it less likely that SIDS alone explains everything.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then another person would need to be responsible for the injuries. If another person is responsible then, the hypoxic damage would most likely need to happen a few hours before Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, even if Jane is not guilty.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, then the hypoxic damage to his brain would almost certainly have occurred in the hours leading up to his death, as smothering directly causes oxygen deprivation.\n\n99\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, these similarities would have to arise from some other coincidental factors or underlying causes. SIDS is mentioned as a possibility, and certain risk factors correlate with SIDS, potentially explaining some of the similarities. However, the combination of all these similarities (age, time of day after feeding, being alone with Jane) occurring by chance is quite low. While not impossible, it would be unusual.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the incidents become far more probable. A perpetrator often develops a pattern or method. The age of the babies, the timing after feeding, and Jane being alone with them all point to a deliberate action on her part. It suggests a specific window of opportunity and a consistent approach to the crimes.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then another explanation must account for the injuries found on Andy's body. These injuries are stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" so their presence strongly suggests foul play. If Jane is innocent, this means someone else inflicted these injuries, or they arose from an incredibly rare and unusual combination of natural events that mimic abuse. Given the statement linking these injuries to abuse and smothering, the likelihood of them being present if Jane is not guilty is relatively low.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, and the injuries found during the re-examination are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" then the presence of these injuries is highly likely.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then an alternative explanation is needed for the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages. These findings are stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Thus, for Jane to be innocent, these symptoms would have to be caused by something else. Although possible, these are more likely indications of smothering/trauma than a natural cause.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering or inflicting violent trauma on Ben, and the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are consistent with these actions, then their presence is very likely.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the injuries were present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it would be expected that medical professionals would have noticed them. The fact that they were not noted suggests either the injuries were very subtle and easily missed, or that they occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital. If we assume the injuries were significant, then the injuries probably were not present when he arrived to the hospital.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, it's plausible that she inflicted the injuries shortly before calling for help, meaning they would have been present when Ben arrived at the hospital. However, it's also possible she inflicted some injuries earlier, and then a final, fatal act caused the hypoxic damage. The injuries may have also been missed by the nurses due to the urgency and focus on resuscitation. Given the possibilities, it's more probable they were present.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, then it becomes quite probable that these findings would be present in Ben. This would support a scenario where a natural event (perhaps related to SIDS) led to his death, and subsequent events explained the other findings.\n\n80\n",
  "Even if Jane is guilty, it's still possible the spinal bleeding occurred naturally or that the ribs were dislocated post-mortem or during resuscitation efforts. These findings aren't necessarily directly caused by her actions (smothering or violent trauma). So the likelihood remains moderate.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to other causes (natural or accidental), the absence of petechiae, a typical sign of smothering, would be expected. The absence of a symptom consistent with smothering supports the view that Ben's death wasn't due to smothering, thus making it likely if she is not guilty.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae is somewhat unexpected, as they are considered a typical sign of smothering. However, their absence doesn't rule out smothering entirely. Petechiae may not always be present in every case of smothering, depending on the method used and the individual's physiology. So, the absence of petechiae in a smothering case is plausible but not highly likely.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries found on Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts, then the presence of such injuries is likely, as resuscitation was performed. However, we know some injuries found on Andy are NOT consistent with resuscitation attempts, but more associated with abuse (bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung). Therefore the injuries from resuscitation could be there, but the other injuries are less likely if she's not guilty.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of harming or smothering Andy, the initial explanation that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts provides a convenient cover story. The fact that some injuries are indeed consistent with resuscitation helps mask the true cause of death. Therefore, some injuries could occur through smothering, and some during attempts to revive him (after she had already hurt him). Therefore, the injuries found are fairly likely.\n\n70\n",
  "Weighing all the evidence, the similarities between the two deaths, the specific injuries found on both children (some inconsistent with natural causes or resuscitation), and the fact that Jane was alone with both children when they became unresponsive points towards a higher probability of guilt. The alternative explanation of SIDS becomes less convincing with the presence of injuries indicative of abuse. However, the absence of some typical signs of smothering in Ben introduces some uncertainty. There is no explicit direct evidence that Jane hurt the children, it is all circumstantial.\n\nTaking all factors into account, the probability lies somewhere between leaning towards guilt, but acknowledge there are a few data points that don't quite fit.\n\n75\n",
  "Based on the presented information, a definitive verdict is not possible. A real-world jury would need to consider all the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense, and would need to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. However, based on the information given, the likelihood of guilt is fairly high. Therefore my verdict is:\n\nGuilty\n"
