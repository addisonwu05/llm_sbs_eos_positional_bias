Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\nLet's assess each similarity individually if Jane is not guilty:\n\n1. **Similar Age:** SIDS is most common in the first few months of life. So, it's plausible that two infants in the same family could be victims of SIDS at roughly similar ages.\n2. **Similar Time of Day After Being Fed:** Babies are often put down to sleep after feeding. If the babies had similar feeding schedules, it's plausible they'd be found at similar times after feeding, especially if SIDS is a factor.\n3. **Found Unconscious by Jane when Alone:** This is the most difficult to explain without Jane's involvement. If the babies died of SIDS or other natural causes while Jane was caring for them, she would naturally be the one to find them.\n\nWhile each individual similarity could arise independently, the *combination* of all three is less likely to occur purely by chance.

The primary alternative in this scenario is SIDS, or some other undiagnosed medical condition.\n\nWhile SIDS itself does not directly cause hypoxic brain damage as a primary mechanism, a related event *could* lead to hypoxia just before death. For instance, if Ben had a sudden, severe respiratory event (like a choking episode, or an arrhythmia causing reduced blood flow to the brain) due to an undiagnosed condition, this could have resulted in hypoxic damage in the hours leading up to his death.

If Jane is innocent, this suggests that the injuries were present but missed.\n\nConsidering both options:\n\nGiven that rib and spinal cord injuries are involved, it is unlikely, although not impossible, that the injuries were completely missed.
