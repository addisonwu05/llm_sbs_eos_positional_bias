Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, the specific findings in Ben's autopsy, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are stated to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\n\nSIDS is characterized by its sudden and unexplained nature, but it typically does not present with specific pathological findings like hypoxic damage to the brain or haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids that are indicative of a violent or traumatic cause of death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, implying that she did not smother her children, the presence of these specific injuries in Ben would need an alternative explanation. While it's possible for infants to suffer from various conditions that could result in similar findings (e.g., accidental trauma, other medical conditions), the specific constellation of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is more typically associated with asphyxia or smothering.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that some research and medical literature suggest that certain findings like retinal hemorrhages can occur in a small percentage of SIDS cases, though this is not the same as saying these are typical or characteristic of SIDS.\n\nGiven this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are due to some other cause (not smothering by Jane) is relatively low because these findings are not typical for SIDS or other natural causes.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 20"
