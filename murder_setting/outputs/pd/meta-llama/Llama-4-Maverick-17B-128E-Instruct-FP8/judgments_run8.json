  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the probabilities, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe cumulative weight of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of the two children, the presence of non-accidental injuries, and the medical findings, strongly supports the conclusion that Jane is responsible for the deaths of her children.\n\nWhile there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations for certain findings, the overall pattern of evidence is highly suggestive of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, my verdict is: **Guilty**."
