Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, in the context of an 11-week-old infant who was found dead and initially attributed to natural causes or SIDS, the presence of bruises might be considered unusual but not entirely impossible due to accidental injury or handling. The key issue is whether these are more likely due to abuse or other causes.\n\n2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly in infants who cannot move around or inflict such injuries on themselves. It is considered a significant indicator of potential abuse.\n\n3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of several conditions, including infection, accidental or non-accidental injury (such as suffocation or smothering), or other medical conditions.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and we are considering an alternative explanation like SIDS for both deaths, we must assess whether the findings could be consistent with SIDS or other non-abusive causes.\n\nSIDS is diagnosed when an infant's death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are generally not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS deaths are typically not associated with significant pathological findings that would explain death, although minor changes can sometimes be present.\n\nThe re-examination findings (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) suggest that Andy's death might not have been a straightforward case of SIDS or natural causes. If Jane is not guilty, these findings need an alternative explanation. \n\nHowever, if we are to consider the probability of these specific findings occurring in Andy if Jane is not guilty (implying that the cause of death and injuries might be unrelated to her actions), we are essentially evaluating how plausible it is that these signs could be present without being related to smothering or abuse by Jane.\n\nThe injuries found are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury. If Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider other potential perpetrators or alternative explanations. However, the scenario doesn't directly support an alternative perpetrator or cause for these specific injuries.\n\nGiven this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes or being misinterpreted is relatively low because they are typically associated with non-accidental injury.\n\nThe probability judgment: 5"

Both Andy and Ben died at around 2-3 months, which, while not extremely common, is within the range of typical ages for SIDS or other infant deaths. This similarity could be coincidental given the relatively narrow age range for heightened vulnerability.\n\n2. **They both died at a similar time of day after just being fed**: Infant deaths can occur at any time. The fact that both occurred after feeding might be coincidental, as feeding is a regular activity for infants. The timing could be related to the natural rhythms of infant care and the vulnerabilities associated with certain times of the day or activities.\n\n3. **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them**: This is perhaps the most striking similarity. However, it's also a circumstance that could arise due to Jane being the primary caregiver and thus being the one to discover the infants unresponsive.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities depends on how probable it is for these events to occur coincidentally. SIDS deaths or unexplained infant deaths share some common characteristics due to the age and vulnerability of the infants. However, the specific combination of these similarities (age, timing relative to feeding, and being found by Jane) is less common.\n\nThe probability of all these specific similarities occurring by chance is relatively low because it involves a combination of factors. However, assessing the exact probability is challenging without a large dataset of SIDS or infant death cases for comparison.\n\nGiven the uniqueness of the combination of these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring naturally is relatively low.\n\nThe probability judgment: 20"
