  "Based on the analysis of the evidence presented, the verdict is: Guilty.\n\nThis verdict is based on the cumulative weight of the evidence, which suggests that Jane was responsible for the deaths of her two sons, Andy and Ben, through smothering or other forms of non-accidental injury. The similarities between the two deaths, the presence of injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma, and the medical evidence supporting asphyxia or smothering all contribute to this conclusion."
