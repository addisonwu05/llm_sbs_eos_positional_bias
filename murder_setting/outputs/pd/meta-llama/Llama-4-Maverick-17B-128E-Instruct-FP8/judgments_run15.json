  "Based on the analysis of the evidence presented, it is highly probable that Jane is guilty of the charges brought against her. The presence of significant and similar injuries in both children, the suspicious circumstances surrounding their deaths, and the low likelihood of these events occurring naturally or being coincidental all contribute to this conclusion.\n\nVerdict: Guilty"
