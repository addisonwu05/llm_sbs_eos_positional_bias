Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To address this question, we need to consider the given information and the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) in Andy if Jane is not guilty of smothering him.\n\nFirst, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another natural cause, given that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes.\n\nThe findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung upon re-examination are generally considered indicative of non-accidental injury (NAI) or abuse. However, the presence of these findings doesn't necessarily prove smothering or murder. They suggest that there could have been some form of trauma or abuse.\n\nHowever, the question is asking us to consider the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty, implying we're looking at a scenario where Andy's death is not due to smothering or murder by Jane.\n\n1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur in infants due to various reasons, not necessarily due to abuse. However, in infants as young as 11 weeks, significant bruising is unusual and typically raises concerns about NAI.\n\n2. **Torn frenulum**: This is often associated with a blow to the mouth or forced feeding, which is a significant indicator of NAI.\n\n3. **Blood in the lung**: This can be associated with various conditions, including infection, but in the context of other injuries, it might suggest trauma.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty of smothering or murdering Andy, the presence of these injuries doesn't fit with a straightforward SIDS diagnosis or a completely natural death without any underlying condition that could cause such injuries.\n\nHowever, it's also known that some infants who die from SIDS or other natural causes might have minor injuries or marks that are coincidental or due to attempts at resuscitation. The key here is understanding that the presence of these specific injuries (especially a torn frenulum) in an infant is generally considered to be a significant red flag for NAI.\n\nGiven that Jane is not guilty implies we're looking at a scenario where these findings need to be explained by other means. While it's possible for an infant to have some of these findings coincidentally (e.g., due to medical conditions or accidental injury), the combination of these specific injuries is highly unusual in the context of a natural death like SIDS.\n\nTo directly answer the question: if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the observed injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) being present in Andy due to other causes (not smothering or murder by Jane) is considered low, given the implication of NAI associated with these findings.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 5"

If Jane is guilty, these similarities could indicate a pattern of behavior.\n\n2. **Injuries found in both Andy and Ben**: The presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma in both infants, upon re-examination, supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty. The initial attribution of these injuries to other causes (like resuscitation attempts) does not negate the possibility of Jane's guilt, especially if the re-examination findings are considered more reliable.\n\n3. **Medical evidence and expert testimony**: The medical findings, including hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben, are consistent with asphyxial trauma, supporting the prosecution's case. The timing of these injuries, as assessed by medical experts, is also critical.\n\n4. **Alternative explanations**: The defense could argue that the deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes. However, the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma makes this explanation less plausible.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there are plausible alternative explanations for some of the evidence (e.g., injuries being due to resuscitation or natural causes), the cumulative effect of the evidence, particularly the similarities between the two deaths and the presence of non-accidental injuries in both infants, supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 75"
