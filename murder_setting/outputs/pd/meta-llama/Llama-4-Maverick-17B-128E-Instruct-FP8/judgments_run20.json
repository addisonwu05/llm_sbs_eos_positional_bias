  "Based on the evidence and analysis, I would state that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThis verdict is based on the cumulative evidence of the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma or smothering, and the medical expert opinions supporting asphyxial death. While there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations, the overall pattern and evidence strongly suggest Jane's guilt."
