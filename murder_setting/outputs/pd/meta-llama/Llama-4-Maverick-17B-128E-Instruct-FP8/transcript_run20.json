Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The question then is how likely it is that Ben's autopsy findings (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are consistent with an alternative cause, such as SIDS or another natural or accidental cause.\n\nSIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion where no cause of death is found after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages typically indicates that there was some form of stress or insult to the infant before death, which does not align well with the classic definition of SIDS as lacking any identifiable cause.\n\nHowever, it's known that certain conditions or events can lead to hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in infants, and these can sometimes be associated with natural diseases or accidental causes. But the specific pattern of injuries described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is often associated with smothering or asphyxia.\n\nIf we are to consider Jane not guilty, we must then consider alternative explanations for Ben's injuries. While SIDS is often cited as a potential cause in cases of unexpected infant death, the presence of specific injuries like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. \n\nThe literature and expert opinion in forensic pathology often suggest that such findings are more indicative of asphyxial or traumatic injury rather than SIDS. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying that the death was not due to smothering or other violent trauma caused by her), it becomes challenging to attribute these specific autopsy findings to SIDS or a completely natural cause without other evidence.\n\nGiven the information and the assumption that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings occurring without smothering or violent trauma is relatively low because the autopsy results strongly suggest some form of asphyxiation or trauma.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

The autopsy findings of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with asphyxia or smothering. Such actions would lead to a lack of oxygen being supplied to the brain and other tissues, resulting in hypoxic damage. The physical stress and pressure associated with smothering can also cause petechial hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids due to the increased venous pressure.\n\nForensic pathology literature supports the association between asphyxial deaths (including smothering) and the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain along with hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids. Therefore, if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of observing these autopsy findings is high because they are direct consequences of the asphyxial event.\n\nThe presence of these findings is considered strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that Ben died from asphyxia or smothering, making it more likely that Jane's actions (if she is guilty) resulted in these specific autopsy findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

If Ben experienced a natural or accidental event leading to hypoxia (such as a severe infection, accidental asphyxia not caused by Jane, or another medical condition), the timing of this event relative to his death would depend on the specifics of that condition.\n\nHowever, the statement that the hypoxic damage \"must have been caused a matter of hours before death\" is a medical opinion based on the examination.
