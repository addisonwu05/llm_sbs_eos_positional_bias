Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

While these can be consistent with smothering, they are not exclusive to smothering. Other causes could potentially lead to similar findings, such as accidental suffocation or other forms of asphyxia not related to smothering by Jane.\n\nHowever, given the context that the prosecution is suggesting these findings are due to smothering by Jane, if Jane is not guilty, we have to consider whether these findings could occur through other means or if they could be artefactual or misinterpreted.\n\n1. **Alternative Causes**: There could be medical conditions or accidents that result in similar pathological findings. However, the specific combination of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is quite specific and typically raises suspicion of asphyxial mechanisms.\n\n2. **SIDS or Natural Causes**: The provided information on SIDS indicates it is a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't directly cause the specific injuries described for Ben. SIDS is more about the absence of a clear cause of death rather than a cause itself.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation or Artefact**: The injuries described could be due to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, though the specific pattern described (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) is generally considered to be associated with an asphyxial event.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, for the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to be present, there would need to be an alternative explanation that is equally or more plausible than smothering. Given the specifics of the case and the nature of the injuries, if we are to assume Jane did not smother Ben, we are left with a scenario where either there was an alternative cause for the asphyxial signs or the interpretation of the findings is incorrect.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages could occur if Jane is not guilty (and thus not smothering), we need to consider the plausibility of alternative explanations for these specific findings.\n\nThe specific injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages) are strongly suggestive of an asphyxial event.

However, the specific combination and nature of the injuries, along with the similarities between the two deaths, make these explanations less likely.\n\n5. **Assessment of Guilt**: Considering the cumulative effect of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths, the nature of the injuries, and the pathological findings, it appears that there is significant evidence pointing towards Jane's guilt.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the possibility of alternative explanations and the uncertainty inherent in complex cases like this.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"
