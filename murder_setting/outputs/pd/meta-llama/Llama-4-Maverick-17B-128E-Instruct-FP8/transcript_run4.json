Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

In such a case, we have to consider alternative explanations for the observed injuries and conditions, such as SIDS or other natural causes.\n\nThe presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, along with other injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the subsequent findings in Andy's autopsy, initially suggested to the investigators that the deaths might not have been natural. However, if we are to assume Jane is not guilty, we must consider whether these findings could be consistent with an alternative explanation.\n\nSIDS is often considered when there's no clear cause of death in infants. However, SIDS typically doesn't present with the extensive injuries found in Ben (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages, etc.). These specific findings are more indicative of a traumatic or asphyxial event rather than SIDS.\n\nThe doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death is a critical piece of information. If Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it becomes challenging to explain the hypoxic damage as occurring just before death without attributing it to an external or unnatural cause.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the hypoxic damage could be misinterpreted or that there are rare natural conditions that could result in similar findings. \n\nGiven that Ben's death is being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, and thus looking for alternative explanations, we need to assess the likelihood of the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death under natural or non-criminal circumstances.\n\nThe likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there are plausible natural or accidental explanations for Ben's condition. If we are to assume the death was not due to smothering or a similar act, there are still several other potential causes of hypoxic damage (e.g., accidental asphyxia, undiagnosed medical conditions, etc.), though they are quite rare.\n\nTherefore, while it is less likely for the specific timing and nature of the hypoxic damage to be explained by SIDS or other completely natural causes without any suspicious circumstances, there could be other rare medical or accidental explanations.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 20"

If Jane is guilty and smothered Ben, it's plausible that the act causing the hypoxic damage happened shortly before death, potentially as part of the same event that led to his demise.\n\nThe injuries found on Ben, including the hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, are consistent with a violent or forceful act, such as smothering or shaking.

The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies at the time of death, the time of day, the circumstance of being recently fed, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could initially seem suspicious and suggestive of a pattern.\n\nHowever, if we consider that both deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural causes, some of these similarities can be explained by the circumstances common to both infants. For example, both being around the same age and being fed before being put to bed are common practices and conditions for infants of that age group.\n\nThe fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious is also not surprising, given that she was their primary caregiver. It's plausible that she was with them during their last moments or discovered them because of her caregiving role.\n\nWhile SIDS can occur without warning and is somewhat random, certain risk factors and circumstances (like age and time of day) can be somewhat similar due to the typical patterns of infant care.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of two SIDS deaths occurring under very similar circumstances in the same family is low, not because SIDS is contagious or directly related to familial factors in a deterministic way, but because SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000).\n\nThe probability that both deaths occur under similar circumstances by coincidence is not extremely high, given the rarity of SIDS and the specificity of the circumstances.
