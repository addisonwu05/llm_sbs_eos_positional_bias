Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, the specific autopsy findings for Ben (hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and the re-examination findings for Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of a non-natural cause of death, typically associated with smothering or other forms of trauma.\n\nSIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when no other cause of death can be found after a thorough investigation and autopsy. The presence of significant pathological findings such as hypoxic damage and haemorrhages is not typical for SIDS. SIDS deaths are generally not associated with significant autopsy findings indicative of trauma or asphyxia.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were due to a natural or accidental cause rather than smothering or other violent trauma by her), the likelihood of Ben having hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids due to SIDS or another natural cause is low. These findings are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause rather than SIDS.\n\nHowever, there are other potential causes for such findings, though they are not SIDS. For instance, accidental or non-intentional actions leading to asphyxia or other forms of infant maltreatment could potentially result in similar autopsy findings. Yet, given the specific context that these findings are being considered under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we're examining the possibility that these could occur without her intentional act.\n\nThe probability that Ben's autopsy findings are due to natural or non-criminal causes (in line with Jane not being guilty) would be considered low due to the nature of the findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

However, the specific circumstances surrounding the deaths (e.g., being found by Jane after feeding) might not be directly related to the cause of death (SIDS or otherwise).\n\nGiven these considerations, while the overall probability of two SIDS deaths in one family is very low, the specific similarities mentioned could be considered in the context of other factors.\n\nThe probability that these similarities occur by chance, given that Jane is not guilty (and thus assuming both deaths are not due to her actions), is still relatively low but is complicated by the fact that some of these factors (like being found by Jane) are circumstantial.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"
