Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids in Ben, as well as the re-examination findings in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), are specific pathological changes that are not typically characteristic of SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when the death of an infant is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy.\n\nThe findings in Ben, particularly the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause, such as smothering, rather than SIDS. While it's theoretically possible for an infant to experience hypoxia (low oxygen levels) due to various reasons, the specific constellation of findings in Ben is more commonly associated with asphyxiation or smothering.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). However, the specific autopsy findings in Ben are not typical for SIDS. \n\nThe likelihood of these findings (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages) occurring in the context of SIDS or another non-violent, non-traumatic cause is low because these are not characteristic features of SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS or another natural cause, it would be unusual for Ben to have these specific autopsy findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 20 \n\n(This judgment reflects the low likelihood of the specific autopsy findings being consistent with SIDS or another natural cause, given that they are more commonly associated with asphyxiation or trauma.)\n\n20"
