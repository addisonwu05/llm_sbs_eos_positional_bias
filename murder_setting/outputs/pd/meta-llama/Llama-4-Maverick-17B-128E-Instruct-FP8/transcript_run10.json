Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found in both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes or be indicative of a different underlying condition or circumstance.\n\n1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: Bruising in infants can occur due to various reasons, including accidental injury, birth trauma, or bleeding disorders. However, in the context of a baby who was thought to have died of natural causes initially, the presence of bruises might suggest that there was either an initial misinterpretation of the cause of these bruises or they were not recognized as significant at the time.\n\n2. **Torn frenulum**: A torn frenulum is often associated with non-accidental injury, particularly if it is considered in isolation. However, it can also occur accidentally, though this is less common. The significance of a torn frenulum can depend on the explanation provided for it.\n\n3. **Blood in the lung**: This finding could be consistent with a number of different scenarios, including infection, accidental or non-accidental trauma, or other medical conditions.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, several alternative explanations could be considered for the findings in Andy and Ben. One such explanation is that both deaths were SIDS, but this doesn't directly explain the injuries found. Another possibility is that there was a misinterpretation of the autopsy findings or that there was an underlying medical condition that contributed to these findings.\n\nHowever, given that the injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of possible non-accidental trauma, if Jane is not guilty, it implies these findings should be explained by other means.\n\nSIDS is not typically associated with such injuries, and while it is possible for a child to have underlying conditions or coincidental findings that could be misinterpreted, the presence of these specific injuries in both children raises suspicions.\n\nTo provide a probability judgment, we need to weigh the likelihood of these findings occurring in a context where Jane is not guilty (and thus the deaths and injuries might be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other medical conditions) against the evidence suggesting non-accidental injury.\n\nThe probability that these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are found in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because these are not typical findings associated with SIDS or most natural causes of death in infants. They are more commonly associated with non-accidental injury.\n\nHowever, without more specific information on alternative explanations for these findings and their likelihood, we have to consider that the presence of these injuries is unusual for SIDS or natural deaths.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could have been caused by various factors not directly related to her actions, such as an underlying medical condition or an accident. However, the timing of the hypoxic damage (a matter of hours before death) is what's critical.\n\nFor SIDS or a natural cause, it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage would be observable and attributed to a specific timeframe before death unless there was an identifiable cause or condition leading to that damage. \n\nHowever, the presence of hypoxic damage indicates that there was a period of oxygen deprivation. If this occurred a matter of hours before death, it suggests that there was a significant event or condition that led to this damage.\n\nTo assess the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the plausibility of other causes or explanations for this damage that are not related to Jane's actions. \n\nThe medical evidence and autopsy findings would be crucial in determining the likelihood of this scenario. If the hypoxic damage is confirmed and dated to a matter of hours before death, the question becomes whether this could plausibly occur without Jane being guilty (e.g., due to an underlying condition, accidental cause, etc.).\n\nGiven that the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death suggests a significant and potentially identifiable cause, and if we assume that Jane is not guilty and thus not responsible for causing this damage, the likelihood of this scenario occurring without her guilt still depends on the medical plausibility and alternative explanations.\n\nSince the occurrence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is a factual finding that doesn't directly imply guilt or innocence but rather indicates a medical condition or event, the question is whether this could happen without Jane being guilty.\n\nThe probability that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is dependent on the existence of plausible alternative causes or explanations.

This similarity could be considered coincidental, given that both were infants and the age range for SIDS or other natural causes can cluster around this period.\n\n2. **They both died at a similar time of day after just being fed**: This could be related to the routine care of infants, where feeding often occurs around similar times of the day.

If Jane is guilty, this similarity could indicate a pattern.\n\n2. **Injuries found in both infants**: The presence of injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma in both Andy and Ben supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty.\n\n3. **Medical evidence**: The hypoxic damage and other injuries found in Ben are consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxia, supporting the guilt hypothesis.\n\n4. **Lack of clear alternative explanations**: While SIDS is a possible explanation for both deaths, the presence of injuries and the similarities between the two incidents make this less likely.\n\nConsidering these points, the evidence against Jane is substantial. While each piece of evidence can be interpreted in different ways, collectively, they paint a picture that supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that some of the evidence can be explained by alternative hypotheses (e.g., resuscitation attempts causing some injuries, natural causes for some findings). The absence of certain expected findings in cases of smothering (like petechiae in Ben) introduces some uncertainty.\n\nGiven the cumulative effect of the evidence, while there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations, the overall pattern and the specific details of the case suggest a high likelihood of Jane's guilt.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

The similarities between the two deaths, the presence of injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma, and the medical evidence supporting asphyxia or smothering all contribute to this conclusion."
