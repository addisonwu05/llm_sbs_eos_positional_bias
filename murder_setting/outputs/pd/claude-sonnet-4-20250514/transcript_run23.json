Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, these would be coincidental similarities in two separate SIDS cases.\n\nFor the age similarity: SIDS has a peak incidence between 2-4 months, with most cases occurring between 1-6 months. Having two SIDS deaths occur at similar ages (8-11 weeks) is not particularly unusual given the typical age distribution of SIDS.\n\nFor the timing similarity (after feeding, similar time of day): SIDS can occur at any time, but there are some patterns. Many SIDS cases do occur during sleep periods, and feeding/sleep cycles are regular in infants. This similarity, while notable, is not extremely rare.\n\nFor Jane being alone and finding both babies: As the primary caregiver (common in many families), Jane would statistically be more likely to be the one to discover either child, whether from natural or unnatural causes.\n\nWhile these similarities are striking and warrant investigation, they are not so extraordinarily unlikely that they couldn't occur by chance in two separate natural deaths. The combination of similarities is notable but not astronomically improbable.\n\n75"
