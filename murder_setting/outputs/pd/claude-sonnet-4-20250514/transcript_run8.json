Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both babies were similar ages (8-11 weeks old)\n2. Both died at similar times of day after being fed\n3. Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, these would be coincidental similarities in two separate SIDS cases.\n\nFor the age similarity: SIDS has a peak occurrence between 2-4 months of age, so deaths at 8-11 weeks would fall within the higher-risk period. This similarity is somewhat expected given the typical SIDS age distribution.\n\nFor the timing similarity (after feeding, similar time of day): Many infant care routines follow similar patterns, so feeding times and sleep periods often occur at consistent times. This increases the likelihood of similar timing being coincidental.\n\nFor Jane being alone both times: Given that Jane appears to be the primary caregiver and mothers often spend significant time alone with infants during daily care routines, this similarity, while notable, could reasonably occur by chance.\n\nHowever, the combination of all these specific similarities, along with the extremely low baseline probability of SIDS (1 in 4,000), and having two SIDS deaths in the same family, makes the overall probability quite low.\n\nThe probability of these specific similarities occurring if Jane is not guilty would be relatively low due to the convergence of multiple coincidental factors.\n\n25"
