Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both babies were approximately the same age (8-11 weeks old)\n2. Both died at similar times of day after being fed\n3. Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, these would be coincidental similarities in two separate SIDS cases.\n\nFor the age similarity: SIDS has a peak incidence between 2-4 months, so deaths at 8-11 weeks, while not at the absolute peak, are within a reasonably common age range for SIDS. The probability of both falling in this narrow window is moderate.\n\nFor the timing (after feeding, similar time of day): Many infant care routines are similar, and feeding times often align with when babies are put down to sleep. This timing pattern is relatively common in infant deaths.\n\nFor Jane being alone and finding them: Given typical family routines where one parent may be alone with children for portions of the day, this is not extraordinarily unlikely, though having it happen twice does reduce the probability.\n\nThe combination of all these specific similarities occurring by chance in two separate natural deaths is relatively low, though not impossible given normal infant care patterns and SIDS characteristics.\n\n25"
