Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone\n\nIf these were natural deaths (SIDS), let me consider each similarity:\n\n**Age similarity (8-11 weeks):** SIDS has a known age distribution with peak incidence between 2-4 months, so deaths in this age range are actually quite common for SIDS cases. This similarity is fairly likely.\n\n**Time of day after feeding:** SIDS often occurs during sleep periods, and feeding followed by sleep is a normal infant pattern. This timing would be somewhat common for natural infant deaths.\n\n**Found by Jane when alone:** As the primary caregiver (typical for mothers), Jane would statistically be the most likely person to discover either child in distress, and caregivers are often alone with infants during routine care. This is quite probable.\n\nHowever, the combination of ALL these similarities occurring together in two separate natural deaths, while each individual element might be somewhat expected, creates a pattern that becomes less likely when considered collectively.\n\nThe medical evidence (injuries found in Ben, and retrospectively in Andy) also weighs against the natural death hypothesis, though the question focuses specifically on the behavioral similarities.\n\nConsidering the statistical likelihood of such a specific pattern of similarities occurring twice by chance in natural infant deaths:\n\n**75**"

This would be virtually certain.\n\n**Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** During smothering, the obstruction of airways causes increased pressure in the head and facial blood vessels as the victim struggles for air. This increased pressure commonly causes small blood vessels around the eyes to rupture, creating the characteristic hemorrhages to eyes and eyelids seen in asphyxiation cases. This is a classic forensic finding in smothering cases.\n\n**The combination together:** These two findings together represent the classic pathophysiological response to smothering - oxygen deprivation causing brain damage, combined with increased vascular pressure causing facial/ocular hemorrhages. This pattern is exactly what forensic pathologists expect to see in smothering cases.\n\nIf Jane deliberately smothered Ben, these findings would be the direct and predictable medical consequences of that action.
