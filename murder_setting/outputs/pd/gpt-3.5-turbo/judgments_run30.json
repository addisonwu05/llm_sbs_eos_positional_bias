  "It is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of these similarities occurring if Jane is not guilty, as there could be other factors at play. However, based on the information provided, considering the low frequency of SIDS and the specific circumstances surrounding both incidents, one could estimate the probability to be around 30%. \n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents occurring would be much higher. Given the specifics of the case and the evidence suggesting smothering as the cause of death for both children, the probability of these similarities arising due to Jane's actions could be around 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being present due to other causes apart from smothering would be very low. Given the specific nature of these injuries and medical findings, the probability of these indicators pointing to a different cause of death in Andy could be estimated to be around 10%.\n\n10",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be very high. Given the evidence suggesting smothering as the cause of death for both children, the probability of these injuries pointing to smothering in Andy could be estimated to be around 95%. \n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present due to causes other than smothering or violent trauma would be relatively low. Given the specific nature of these injuries and their consistency with smothering or violent trauma, the probability of these findings pointing to other causes in Ben could be around 20%.\n\n20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death due to other reasons apart from smothering or violent trauma would be relatively low. Given the intricacies of the medical findings and the circumstances surrounding Ben's death, the probability of the hypoxic damage having a different explanation could be around 15%.\n\n15",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death due to smothering or violent trauma would be much higher. Given the evidence suggesting smothering as the cause of death for both children and the specific timing of the damage, the probability of the hypoxic damage being attributable to the actions of Jane could be around 80%. \n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes would be relatively high. Given that resuscitation attempts can lead to injuries, especially in a baby, the probability of these injuries being consistent with resuscitation in Andy could be estimated to be around 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being a result of abusive actions such as smothering would be higher. Although some injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts, the presence of specific indicators of abuse suggests a higher probability that these injuries were not solely the result of resuscitation. Considering the context of the case, the probability of the injuries in Andy being linked to abuse could be around 60%.\n\n60",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being attributed to natural causes, post-mortem changes, or resuscitation attempts would be relatively high. Given the potential explanations for these particular findings in the case that exclude direct abuse, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs having origins other than abuse in Ben could be estimated to be around 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being linked to abusive actions such as smothering or violent trauma would be higher. These specific injuries are more indicative of abuse rather than innocent circumstances. Taking into account the evidence suggesting abuse in the case, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being associated with abuse in Ben could be around 70%. \n\n70",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite other injuries present, could be due to various factors. While petechiae are often associated with smothering cases, their absence does not definitively rule out other potential causes of the injuries observed. Considering the complexity of medical findings, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben in the context of innocence could be around 50%.\n\n50",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, even in the presence of other injuries consistent with abusive actions, could be lower. While petechiae are commonly associated with smothering cases, their absence in a specific instance does not completely rule out the possibility of abuse. Given the potential considerations in this scenario of guilt, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben in the context of guilt could be estimated to be around 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be due to various factors. It is possible that the injuries were overlooked or developed during the hospital stay for additional reasons unrelated to abuse. Considering the uncertainties that can arise in medical assessments, the probability of the injuries not being present initially in the case of innocence could be in the range of 40%.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be lower compared to the scenario where she is not guilty. In cases of abuse, injuries may be inflicted and become more apparent over time or go unnoticed initially. Given the circumstances surrounding the case and the evidence suggesting abuse, the probability of the injuries not being initially present on Ben when he was brought to the hospital in the context of guilt could be around 20%.\n\n20",
  "Based on the evidence provided, including the specific injuries found on both children, the similarities in the circumstances of their deaths, and the medical findings related to abusive actions, the probability that the defendant is guilty could be estimated to be approximately 80%.\n\n80",
  "Guilty."
