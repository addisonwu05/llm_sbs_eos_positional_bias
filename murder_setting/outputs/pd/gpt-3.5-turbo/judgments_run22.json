  "Given the findings of the re-examination of Andy's death, including the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, the likelihood of these injuries occurring due to other causes apart from abuse, such as SIDS, is very low. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the probability of these injuries in Andy being caused by something other than abuse is **0**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy are highly likely to be the result of abuse and indicative of smothering. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of these injuries in Andy being caused by abuse is **100**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is low. Other potential factors such as sudden infant death syndrome or other medical conditions would need to be considered as possible causes of the hypoxic damage. Therefore, the probability of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death in Ben if Jane is not guilty is **10**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the possibility that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is high. Smothering can lead to a lack of oxygen reaching the brain, resulting in hypoxic damage in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death in Ben is **90**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring as a result of causes other than smothering or other violent trauma is very low. Given the medical evidence presented, it is highly indicative of abusive actions. Therefore, the probability of these injuries in Ben being caused by something other than smothering or violent trauma if Jane is not guilty is **5**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely to be a result of the abusive actions, such as smothering or other violent trauma. These types of injuries are consistent with deliberate harm. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages being the result of Jane's actions is **95**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being such striking similarities between both incidents is very low. The consistency in the circumstances surrounding both deaths raises significant concerns and points towards a pattern rather than mere coincidences. Therefore, the probability of these similarities existing between both incidents if Jane is not guilty is **5**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the likelihood of there being such striking similarities between both incidents is very high. The consistent patterns in age, timing, and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Andy and Ben point towards a deliberate and orchestrated series of events. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of these similarities existing between both incidents is **95**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very low. It is improbable that such significant injuries, including rib and spinal cord injuries, as well as hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages, would go unnoticed by medical professionals upon admission to the hospital if they were already present. Therefore, the probability of these injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty is **5**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital is very high. In cases of abuse or smothering, injuries can occur rapidly and may not be immediately visible to the naked eye. It is possible for these injuries to manifest or worsen over time, leading to the discovery of the extent of harm later on. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital is **90**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, despite the other injuries found on Ben, could suggest the possibility of an alternative cause of death or an incomplete understanding of the circumstances. Petechiae are one of the classic signs of smothering or asphyxiation, and their absence in this case raises questions about the cause of death. Therefore, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is **20**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of injuries such as petechiae despite the presence of other injuries may be explained by variations in how the smothering occurred or the specific circumstances of the incidents. While petechiae are commonly associated with smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out the possibility of deliberate harm. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is **40**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy that were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts could indeed be consistent with such efforts, especially in the case of attempting to revive a small child. The presence of these injuries might be explained by the standard procedures followed during resuscitation. Therefore, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty is **70**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found in Andy that were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts may actually be indicative of the harm inflicted during the act of smothering. In cases of smothering, injuries consistent with resuscitation may actually be representative of the trauma caused by the smothering itself. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being related to Jane's actions is **90**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being related to natural causes or occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts is higher in this scenario. Spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural death, and dislocated ribs could potentially occur as a result of handling during resuscitation efforts. Therefore, the probability of these findings in Ben being unrelated to Jane's actions if she is not guilty is **60**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be more likely attributed to the trauma inflicted during the act of smothering rather than to natural causes or post-mortem occurrences. These findings may align with the pattern of deliberate harm in cases of smothering. Therefore, based on the assumption of guilt, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being tied to Jane's actions is **85**.",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the injuries consistent with smothering, the similarities in the circumstances of both incidents, the absence of typical injuries associated with resuscitation, and the presence of injuries indicative of deliberate harm, the probability that the defendant is guilty is high.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant is guilty based on the given evidence is **95**.",
  "Verdict: Guilty"
