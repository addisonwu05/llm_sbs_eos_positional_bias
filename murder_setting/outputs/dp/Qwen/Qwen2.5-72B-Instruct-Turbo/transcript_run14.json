Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

However, the presence of specific injuries like rib and spinal injuries, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, along with the bruising found in Andy, complicates this assessment. These injuries are more consistent with non-accidental trauma than with SIDS, which typically does not leave such marks. \n\nSIDS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other causes of death, including abuse, must be ruled out. The absence of petechiae in Ben could be explained by several factors, such as the specific manner of smothering (if it occurred), the baby's individual physiology, or the timing and duration of the smothering. However, given the significant injuries found in both children, the absence of petechiae does not strongly support a natural cause of death.\n\n考虑到上述因素，如果 Jane 无罪， Ben 死亡时没有出现如 petechiae 等典型窒息伤痕的可能性较低。但鉴于 SIDS 的不确定性，这一可能性依然存在。因此，我判断这一概率为 30。\n\n30"

Petechiae are often associated with suffocation or smothering, as they result from the rupture of small blood vessels in the skin due to increased pressure in the veins. However, the absence of petechiae does not definitively rule out smothering, as the mechanism of suffocation can vary, and not all cases of smothering will result in petechiae.\n\nIn some cases, the pressure applied, the duration of smothering, or the specific method used (e.g., using a soft material) might not cause petechiae. Additionally, the individual physiological response of the infant can play a role. Therefore, while the absence of petechiae is less common in cases of smothering, it is not impossible.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Jane is guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is still possible but less likely.
