Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Petechiae are often, but not always, present in cases of smothering, and their absence does not definitively rule out smothering. However, the absence of petechiae can also be consistent with other causes of death, such as SIDS, which is a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes cannot be identified.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the absence of typical injuries, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is not guilty is relatively high. SIDS is known to be a condition where the cause of death is not always clear, and the lack of petechiae does not necessarily point to a specific cause.\n\nConsidering the above, the probability that the absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with Jane being not guilty is estimated to be around 70%.\n\n70"

    "content": "If Jane is guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is less likely but still possible. Petechiae are often seen in cases of smothering because the pressure on the chest and the blockage of airways can cause small blood vessels to rupture, leading to the appearance of petechiae. However, the presence of petechiae is not guaranteed in all cases of smothering. Factors such as the method of smothering, the duration, and the individual physiology of the infant can influence whether petechiae are present.\n\nIn cases where petechiae are absent, it could be due to the smothering being performed in a way that did not cause enough pressure to rupture the blood vessels, or the infant may have had other underlying conditions that affected the development of petechiae.\n\nGiven these considerations, the absence of petechiae in Ben, if Jane is guilty, is less likely but not impossible. A reasonable estimate for the probability of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is guilty is around 30%.\n\n30"
