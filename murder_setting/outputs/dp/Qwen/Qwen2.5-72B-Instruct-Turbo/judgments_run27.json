  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the various factors, my verdict is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability (85%) that the defendant, Jane, is responsible for the deaths of her children, Andy and Ben, given the consistent pattern of events, the specific injuries found, and the timing of the hypoxic damage."
