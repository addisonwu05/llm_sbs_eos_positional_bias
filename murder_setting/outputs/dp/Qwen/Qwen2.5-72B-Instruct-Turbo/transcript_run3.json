Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The presence or absence of petechiae can be influenced by various factors, including the duration and manner of smothering, the individual characteristics of the infant, and the time elapsed before medical examination.\n\nSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is another potential explanation for Ben's death, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is considered when other causes, such as smothering, have been ruled out. However, SIDS does not typically present with the injuries found in Ben, such as rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and eye hemorrhages.\n\nGiven that the injuries found in Ben are more consistent with smothering or physical trauma than with SIDS, the absence of petechiae does not significantly increase the likelihood of SIDS as the cause of death. However, the absence of petechiae does suggest that if smothering did occur, it may have been performed in a manner that did not cause typical signs of asphyxiation, or that the body may have not been in a state that would show such signs.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, the absence of petechiae in Ben, while not conclusive, is somewhat less likely given the presence of other injuries indicative of trauma. Therefore, the probability that the absence of petechiae would occur if Jane is not guilty is moderate but not very high.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"

Petechiae are often, but not always, present in cases of smothering. The absence of petechiae could be due to several factors, including the specific method of smothering, the duration and force applied, the individual characteristics of the infant, and the timing of the medical examination.\n\nIn cases of smothering, petechiae are typically more likely to be present when the smothering is prolonged or when significant pressure is applied to the chest or neck, causing a rapid increase in intrathoracic or intracranial pressure. However, if the smothering was brief or performed in a way that did not cause a significant pressure differential, petechiae might not form.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of petechiae does not rule out smothering, as other injuries and signs of trauma (such as the rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and eye hemorrhages found in Ben) are more indicative of physical trauma and can still support the conclusion of smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is possible but not highly likely, given the presence of other injuries that are more consistent with smothering.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Similarities in Incidents**: Both Andy and Ben died at similar ages, shortly after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. The similarity in these circumstances is highly unusual and suggests a pattern of behavior.\n\n2. **Injuries Consistent with Smothering**: The injuries found in both Andy and Ben, including hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, bruises, and rib injuries, are strongly indicative of smothering or other forms of violent trauma. These injuries are less likely to occur naturally or as a result of resuscitation alone.\n\n3. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was determined to have occurred a matter of hours before death, which is consistent with a sudden and violent act such as smothering.\n\n4. **Re-examination of Andy’s Death**: The re-examination of Andy’s death revealed injuries that were initially attributed to resuscitation but are more consistent with abuse and smothering. This re-evaluation strengthens the case against Jane.\n\n5. **Absence of Petechiae**: While the absence of petechiae in Ben is notable, it does not rule out smothering, as petechiae are not always present in such cases. The other injuries found in Ben are more indicative of smothering.\n\n6. **Natural Causes vs. Smothering**: While SIDS and other natural causes are possible, the combination of the injuries and the specific circumstances of both deaths make intentional harm a more plausible explanation.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence strongly suggests that Jane is guilty of the murders of her two children.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
