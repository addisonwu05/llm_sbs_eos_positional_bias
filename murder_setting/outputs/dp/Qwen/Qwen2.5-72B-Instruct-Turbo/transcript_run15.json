Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that all other possible causes of death must be ruled out before a diagnosis of SIDS can be made. In cases of SIDS, there are often no obvious signs of trauma or external injuries, which could explain the absence of petechiae.\n\nHowever, the presence of other injuries such as those to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as well as the later discovery of injuries in Andy, significantly complicates the case against the SIDS hypothesis. These injuries are more consistent with non-accidental trauma, such as smothering or shaking.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the presence of other injuries, the absence of petechiae alone does not strongly support or refute the SIDS hypothesis. If Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is still plausible, but it is less likely given the other injuries found. Therefore, the probability that the absence of petechiae in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, is around 30%.\n\n30"

For example, if the smothering was very brief or if the pressure applied was not sufficient to cause petechiae, they might not be present.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of petechiae could be due to errors in the autopsy or the natural variability in how injuries manifest in different individuals.
