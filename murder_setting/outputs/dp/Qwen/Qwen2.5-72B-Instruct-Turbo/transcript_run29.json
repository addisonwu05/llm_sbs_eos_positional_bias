Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Additionally, other conditions or circumstances could have led to the injuries observed in Ben, such as accidental suffocation, undiagnosed medical conditions, or even SIDS, which can sometimes present with injuries that are not typical of SIDS but can occur.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the fact that SIDS can occur without the typical signs of smothering, the absence of petechiae does not strongly support or refute the hypothesis of smothering.

However, the presence or absence of petechiae can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the smothering, such as the method used, the duration, and the individual characteristics of the victim.\n\nIt is possible that the smothering was performed in a way that did not cause petechiae, or that the petechiae were not visible due to the rapid progression of other injuries or due to the infant's small and delicate skin. Additionally, some cases of smothering, particularly in infants, may not always result in the typical signs due to the unique physiology and size of the infant.\n\nGiven these factors, while the absence of petechiae is less common in cases of smothering, it is not impossible.
