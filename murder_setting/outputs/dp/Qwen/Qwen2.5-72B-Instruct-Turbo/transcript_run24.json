Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Resuscitation, especially when performed urgently and by non-professionals, can sometimes result in unintentional injuries to infants. Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are all plausible outcomes of aggressive resuscitation techniques, particularly in a situation where the infant is already fragile and the rescuer is under extreme stress.\n\nHowever, the injuries also need to be considered in the context of the second child, Ben, who also died under suspicious circumstances with more extensive injuries that are less easily explained by resuscitation. This complicates the assessment, as it raises the possibility of a pattern of abuse or neglect. Nonetheless, if we are to consider the case of Andy independently and assume Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are reasonably likely to have occurred during resuscitation attempts.\n\nTaking into account the above considerations and the statistical likelihood of these injuries occurring naturally or during resuscitation, the probability that the injuries in Andy are consistent with an innocent scenario (i.e., not due to Jane's intentional actions) is estimated to be around 70%.\n\n70"

They could be subtle or hidden under clothing and only become apparent during a more detailed post-mortem examination.\n\n2. **Post-Mortem Changes**: Injuries can sometimes appear or become more pronounced after death due to the body's natural processes, such as the pooling of blood (livor mortis) and the stiffening of muscles (rigor mortis).\n\n3. **Handling and Transport**: The process of transporting the body to the hospital and the handling by medical personnel could lead to the appearance of new or more visible injuries.\n\n4. **Nursing Oversight**: It is also possible that the nurses did not conduct a thorough enough examination to detect the injuries initially, or that they were overlooked due to the focus on resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is not guilty, it is reasonably likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present or not noted when he was brought to the hospital.

Factors such as the method of smothering, the duration of the incident, and the individual physiological responses of the infant can affect whether petechiae develop.\n\n2. **Juvenile Anatomy**: Infants, especially very young ones like Ben, may have less pronounced or less visible petechiae due to their smaller and more delicate blood vessels.\n\n3. **Post-Mortem Changes**: The process of death and decomposition can sometimes obscure or prevent the formation of petechiae. If the infant died quickly, there might not have been enough time for these marks to develop.\n\n4. **Alternative Explanations**: The absence of petechiae could also suggest other causes of death, such as SIDS, which does not typically involve the formation of petechiae.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is reasonably likely.

Petechiae are often present in cases of smothering or suffocation, but their absence does not entirely rule out such a cause of death. Several factors can contribute to the absence of petechiae even if smothering occurred:\n\n1. **Method of Smothering**: The specific method used to smother Ben could affect the formation of petechiae. For example, if the smothering was done in a way that did not apply significant pressure to the face or neck, petechiae might not form.\n\n2. **Duration and Intensity**: The duration and intensity of the smothering can influence whether petechiae develop. If the smothering was quick and intense, there might not have been enough time for petechiae to form.\n\n3. **Individual Variability**: Each infant's physiological response to suffocation can vary. Some infants may not develop petechiae even if they have been smothered.\n\n4. **Post-Mortem Changes**: The process of death and the handling of the body can sometimes obscure or prevent the formation of petechiae.\n\n5. **Smothering with a Soft Object**: If a soft object was used to smother Ben, it might not cause the typical pressure marks or petechiae that a harder object would.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the absence of petechiae makes a case of smothering less likely, it is not impossible.

This timing can also make it easier to attribute the infant's unconsciousness to sleep or a medical issue initially.\n\n3. **Being Alone with the Infants**: If Jane is guilty, she would have the opportunity to act when she was alone with the infants, reducing the risk of being caught or having her actions witnessed by others. This is a common scenario in cases of child abuse.\n\n4. **Pattern of Behavior**: The repeated nature of the incidents, with similar circumstances, strongly suggests a pattern of behavior. If Jane is guilty, she would be more likely to repeat the same actions under similar conditions, leading to the striking similarities between the two incidents.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is guilty, the presence of these specific similarities between the deaths of both infants is highly likely. The consistency in the details of the incidents supports the hypothesis of intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these similarities between both incidents are consistent with Jane being guilty is estimated to be around 95%.\n\n95"

Here is a summary of the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Similarities in Circumstances**: Both infants died at a similar age, at similar times of the day, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These striking similarities raise significant concerns about a pattern of intentional harm.\n\n2. **Injuries and Medical Findings**:\n   - **Andy**: Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\n   - **Ben**: Hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, which are also consistent with smothering and violent trauma.\n\n3. **Post-Mortem Findings**: The re-examination of Andy's death revealed injuries that were initially attributed to resuscitation but are now seen as consistent with abuse. This re-evaluation strengthens the case for intentional harm.\n\n4. **Timing of Injuries**: The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages are consistent with smothering occurring a matter of hours before death, which aligns with the possibility of intentional harm.\n\n5. **Lack of Other Explanations**: While other explanations such as SIDS or accidental suffocation are possible, the combination of injuries and the specific pattern of events make these explanations less likely.\n\nGiven these factors, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that Jane is guilty of the murders of both Andy and Ben.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant is guilty is estimated to be around 85%.\n\n85"
