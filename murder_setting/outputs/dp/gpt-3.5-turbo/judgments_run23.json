  "Given that no typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found on Ben, it is highly unlikely for there to be an absence of injuries such as petechiae. The presence of these injuries would typically be expected in cases of smothering. Therefore, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is approximately 10 out of 100. \n\n10",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it is highly likely that injuries such as petechiae would be present on Ben. The absence of petechiae, given the circumstances and evidence presented, would be highly improbable. Therefore, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is guilty is approximately 5 out of 100.\n\n5",
  "Given that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that dislocated ribs may have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that these findings in Ben are not directly related to foul play or smothering. In this case, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is approximately 90 out of 100.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is highly unlikely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found as a result of natural causes or post-mortem factors. These findings would be more in line with intentional harm caused by smothering. Therefore, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is guilty is approximately 15 out of 100.\n\n15",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy, initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, could indeed be consistent with efforts to revive a person, especially a baby. In this scenario, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts would be high. Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries being found in Andy if Jane is not guilty is approximately 95 out of 100.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, it is unlikely that the injuries found in Andy can be solely explained by resuscitation attempts. The presence of additional injuries such as bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung suggests signs of intentional harm rather than just resuscitation-related injuries. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely due to resuscitation attempts is approximately 20 out of 100.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is quite likely that these injuries were not present at the time he was admitted. This could indicate that the injuries developed post-admission, were not visibly apparent, or could have been missed during the initial assessment. Therefore, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty is approximately 75 out of 100.\n\n75",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The nature and severity of the injuries, including spinal bleeding, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages, suggest that these injuries would have been visible and evident at the time of admission. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 10 out of 100. \n\n10",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by smothering or other violent trauma. These specific injuries, especially the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are more indicative of non-accidental trauma or harm. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present on Ben is approximately 20 out of 100.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly indicative of intentional harm caused by smothering or violent trauma. These specific injuries are consistent with the act of smothering and suggest deliberate actions leading to these severe outcomes. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present is approximately 95 out of 100.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be unlikely to be indicative of abuse or characteristic of smothering. These specific injuries are typically associated with intentional harm or violent trauma, rather than accidental causes or natural occurrences. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings being present in Andy is approximately 10 out of 100.\n\n10",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are highly likely to be consistent with abuse and characteristic of smothering. These specific injuries strongly suggest intentional harm inflicted on Andy leading to his death. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present in Andy is approximately 90 out of 100.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability of there being such striking similarities between both incidents, including the babies being about the same age, the timing of their deaths just after being fed, and Jane finding them unconscious when she was alone, would be relatively low. These coincidences would be less likely to occur naturally or due to non-nefarious circumstances. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is approximately 15 out of 100.\n\n15",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the probability of there being such remarkable similarities between both incidents, including the babies being about the same age, the timing of their deaths just after being fed, and Jane finding them unconscious when she was alone, would be much higher. The intentional nature of the act, if Jane is guilty, would suggest that these parallels were not merely coincidental but rather planned or carried out deliberately. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is approximately 80 out of 100.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death would be relatively low. In cases where there is no evidence of foul play, the timeframe of such injuries can be critical in determining the cause and circumstances leading to the damage. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused just hours before death is approximately 25 out of 100.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is guilty of causing harm to Ben, including smothering him, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death would be higher. Deliberate actions, like smothering, could result in such injuries in a relatively short timeframe before the child's death. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused just hours before death is approximately 80 out of 100. \n\n80",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, the timing and circumstances of the deaths, and the expert opinions regarding the nature of the injuries, it appears that the probability of the defendant being guilty is high.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant is guilty based on the given evidence is approximately 90 out of 100.\n\n90",
  "Based on the evidence provided and the analysis conducted, the verdict for the defendant is **Guilty**."
