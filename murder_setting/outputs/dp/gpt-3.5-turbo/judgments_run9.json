  "It is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty. However, in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it is possible for these typical injuries of smothering to be absent. Given the information provided and the uncertainty surrounding SIDS, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is approximately 70.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben would be less likely. In cases of smothering, petechiae are often present due to the lack of oxygen and pressure on the blood vessels in the face and neck. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is approximately 20.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben would be less likely to be related to any harm caused by her. As mentioned, spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts. Given this information, the probability of the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben if Jane is not guilty is approximately 30.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could potentially be explained by the physical harm inflicted during the act of smothering or the struggle that may have occurred. In such cases, the likelihood of these injuries being found in Ben would be higher if Jane is guilty. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is approximately 75.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is more likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the injuries were not noted by the nurses upon Ben's arrival suggests that they may have occurred after he was brought in or were not visible at the time. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 80.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The presence of significant injuries such as spinal bleeding, rib dislocation, and other findings inconsistent with natural causes or SIDS indicate that these injuries were likely inflicted before or around the time of his hospitalization. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 25.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, it is likely that these injuries were indeed a result of the efforts made to revive him. In cases of resuscitation, especially involving infants, certain injuries such as bruising may occur due to the nature of the procedure. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is approximately 70.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found on Andy could be more indicative of inflicted harm rather than resuscitation attempts. Given the additional evidence of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found during further investigations following Ben's death, these injuries may suggest a pattern of abuse rather than accidental injuries from resuscitation. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy not being consistent with resuscitation attempts is approximately 85.",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the findings of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy were not indicative of abuse or smothering, it would suggest that these injuries were indeed related to natural causes or other plausible explanations. Given the initial conclusion of natural causes and the possibility of unforeseen circumstances, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy not being related to abuse or smothering is approximately 50.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung would likely be more indicative of abuse and the act of smothering. These specific injuries are commonly associated with physical harm and trauma inflicted deliberately. Given the additional evidence and the overall circumstances of the case, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being related to abuse or smothering is approximately 90.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not attributed to smothering or other violent trauma, it would suggest that these findings may have occurred due to alternative causes unrelated to abusive actions. Given the complex nature of infant deaths and the potential for various contributing factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids not being related to smothering or violent trauma is approximately 40.",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben or causing other violent trauma, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would align with the effects of such actions. Smothering can result in depriving the victim of oxygen, leading to brain damage, and the pressure on the face can cause hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids. Considering the injuries found and the implications of deliberate harm, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being related to smothering or violent trauma is approximately 95.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of striking similarities between both incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben, such as their age at the time of death, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and the circumstances in which Jane found them unconscious, would likely be attributed to unfortunate coincidences or factors unrelated to criminal activity. Given the focus on possible explanations other than guilt, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities between both incidents not being indicative of criminal behavior is approximately 60.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the crimes, the presence of striking similarities between both incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben, including their age at the time of death, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could be seen as consistent with a pattern of deliberate actions. These similarities may indicate a deliberate and planned approach to causing harm. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities between both incidents being indicative of criminal behavior is approximately 85.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain alleged to have been caused a matter of hours before death was not due to intentional harm, it suggests that there could be an alternate explanation for the timing of the brain damage. Given the complexities involved in determining the exact causation of such damage and the uncertainty surrounding the case, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death not being linked to intentional harm is approximately 50.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the crimes, and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was indeed caused a matter of hours before his death, this timeline would potentially align with the act of smothering or another form of deliberate harm. The timing of the brain damage in relation to the events leading to Ben's death could be crucial in linking Jane's actions to the harm inflicted. Thus, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death due to intentional harm is approximately 80.",
  "Given the evidence presented, which includes the patterns of injuries, the similarities between the incidents involving both children, and the indications of deliberate harm such as the specific injuries found, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty appears to be approximately 85.",
