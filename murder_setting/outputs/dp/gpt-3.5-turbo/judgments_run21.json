  "In cases of death by smothering, the presence of petechiae is often seen due to the lack of oxygen. However, the absence of petechiae in Ben does not definitively rule out the possibility of smothering. It is possible for petechiae to be absent in some cases of smothering, especially in infants. Given this information, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben not being indicative of smothering could be estimated at approximately 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, it would be expected that injuries such as petechiae would be present, as they are commonly associated with smothering. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben being indicative of smothering would be very low, likely around 10%.\n\n10",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben could be more likely to be explained by natural causes or post-mortem occurrences rather than intentional harm. Based on this, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben not being indicative of Jane's guilt could be estimated at around 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs may be more likely to be a result of the harm inflicted on the child during the act of smothering. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben being indicative of intentional harm could be estimated at around 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is possible that the injuries either developed after admission or were not initially visible. Given the possibility of injuries not being immediately visible or detected, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be estimated at around 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is more likely that these injuries were a result of the harm inflicted by Jane rather than being missed or developing after admission. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be estimated at around 20%.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, it is plausible that these injuries were indeed a result of the efforts to revive him rather than intentional harm. In this scenario, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts and not indicative of Jane's guilt could be estimated at around 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found on Andy may be more likely to be a result of the intentional harm inflicted by Jane rather than solely attributed to resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to intentional harm could be estimated at around 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death were indicative of abuse, it would suggest a different explanation for these injuries rather than smothering by Jane. Given this scenario, the likelihood of these particular injuries being present in Andy not being indicative of abuse or smothering by Jane could be estimated at around 20%.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be more likely to be associated with the act of smothering and indicative of intentional harm. In this case, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being linked to smothering by Jane could be estimated at around 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between both incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben, such as their age at the time of death, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, could potentially be attributed to coincidental factors or shared circumstances unrelated to intentional harm. In this scenario, the likelihood of these similarities not being indicative of Jane's guilt could be estimated at around 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the similarities between the incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben could be more likely to be a result of intentional actions by Jane rather than mere coincidences. In this case, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities reflecting her intentional actions could be estimated at around 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was not caused by her actions, the likelihood of the damage being inflicted a matter of hours before death may be lower, as it could suggest other potential causes or events unrelated to intentional harm. In this context, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain not being caused a matter of hours before death in the scenario where Jane is not guilty could be estimated at around 40%.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was likely caused by intentional actions, then it is plausible that the damage occurred a matter of hours before death as suggested by the doctor. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death could be estimated at around 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were not caused by her actions, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present in Ben could be lower and might suggest alternative explanations or underlying conditions not related to intentional harm. In this scenario, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids not being indicative of Jane's guilt could be estimated at around 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would align with the effects of smothering or other violent trauma inflicted upon the child. In this context, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with intentional harm by Jane could be estimated at around 80%.\n\n80",
  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis provided, the probability that the defendant is guilty could be estimated at around 75%.\n\n75",
