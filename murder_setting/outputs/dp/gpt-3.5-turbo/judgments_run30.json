  "It is difficult to determine the probability without more information or evidence. However, given that the injuries were not noted by nurses at the hospital, there is a possibility that they may have occurred after Ben was brought in. Considering the ambiguity of the situation, I would estimate the probability to be around 50%. \n\n50.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital would be very low. Given the nature of the injuries and the fact that they were not noted by nurses initially, it is highly probable that they were present at the time Ben was brought in.\n\n10.",
  "Considering the explanations provided regarding the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, and the possibility that they may have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that these findings were present in Ben.\n\n80.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben increases significantly as they could be indicative of physical harm inflicted on the child.\n\n95.",
  "Given the absence of typical injuries like petechiae in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that such injuries would not be present, as they are common indicators of death by smothering.\n\n90.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben would be unusual, as they are commonly associated with death by smothering. Thus, it is less likely in this scenario.\n\n30.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and considering that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts which are common and necessary in such situations, it is likely that the injuries found in Andy were a result of these efforts.\n\n85.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being intentionally inflicted rather than solely due to resuscitation attempts increases.\n\n70.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death may be lower, as it suggests a more sudden and acute event leading to the damage.\n\n60.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death increases significantly, as it could align with intentional harm leading to the damage.\n\n85.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being present in Andy would be lower, as these findings are typically associated with abuse and smothering, which would not align with Jane's innocence in this context.\n\n20.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being present in Andy would be higher as these are indicators of abuse and smothering, suggesting potential foul play in Andy's case.\n\n95.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these striking similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being about the same age, dying at a similar time, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would be lower as it would point towards a coincidence or some external factors rather than intentional actions.\n\n30.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability of there being these similarities between both incidents would be higher as they could indicate a pattern of behavior or intentional actions on Jane's part.\n\n80.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present would be lower, as they are consistent with smothering and violent trauma, which would not align with Jane's innocence in this scenario.\n\n25.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present would be higher, as these findings align with the potential outcome of smothering or other violent trauma in the case for which she is charged.\n\n90.",
  "Based on the evidence provided, the likelihood that the defendant is guilty appears to be significant.\n\n85.",
  "Guilty."
