  "The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, given the injuries found during the autopsy, is unlikely. However, it is important to consider that not all cases of smothering will result in the presence of petechiae. Based on the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben in Jane's case is approximately 30. \n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben would be highly unlikely. In cases of smothering, the presence of petechiae is a common finding due to the lack of oxygen caused by the obstruction of airways. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is approximately 5.\n\n5",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts would be more likely. It is common for resuscitation efforts to cause injuries such as bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, especially in the case of infants. Based on this information, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty is approximately 70.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the injuries found in Andy could be more likely attributed to the act of smothering rather than just resuscitation attempts. Smothering can lead to injuries like bruising and internal trauma, which could explain the injuries found during Andy's autopsy. If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being caused by smothering is approximately 85.\n\n85",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben could be lower. Spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and dislocated ribs could occur post-mortem or as a result of resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these findings in Ben being unrelated to foul play is approximately 60. \n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben due to the act of smothering could be higher. Smothering can lead to internal injuries and trauma, which could explain these findings. If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being related to the act of smothering is approximately 80. \n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be higher. In cases where injuries are not noted by medical professionals upon admission, it raises questions about the timing and source of those injuries. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 75.\n\n75",
  "If Jane is guilty of causing the injuries to Ben, the likelihood of the injuries not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be lower. If Jane had smothered Ben prior to his arrival at the hospital, the injuries would have been present at that time. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 20. \n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents (both babies being about the same age when they died, dying at a similar time of the day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them) could be considered more circumstantial. Coincidences can occur, and patterns may emerge even in unrelated events. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities being purely coincidental is approximately 50.\n\n50",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both of her children, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents (both babies being about the same age when they died, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them) being connected to her actions would be higher. These consistent patterns could indicate a deliberate and premeditated action on Jane's part. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities being connected to her actions is approximately 80.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death could be lower. Hypoxic brain damage is typically associated with a lack of oxygen to the brain over a prolonged period, which is more likely to occur in situations of intentional harm or neglect. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is approximately 30.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty of causing harm to Ben, including the act of smothering, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death would be higher. Smothering can lead to a lack of oxygen reaching the brain, resulting in hypoxic damage. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is approximately 75. \n\n75",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present would be less likely to be attributed to smothering or other violent trauma. These findings could potentially have other explanations in the absence of intentional harm. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being related to other causes is approximately 20.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present would be higher and could be consistent with the actions of smothering. Smothering can lead to a lack of oxygen to the brain and pressure on the face, which could result in hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being related to her actions is approximately 80. \n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being present as indicators of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be less likely. These specific injuries, especially when re-examined and attributed to abuse, could suggest foul play. If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being present for other reasons is approximately 25.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being present as indicators of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be higher. These specific injuries are consistent with trauma caused by smothering and could suggest deliberate harm. If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being related to her actions is approximately 90.\n\n90",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, and the consistency of certain findings with smothering, the probability that the defendant is guilty is approximately 85. \n\n85",
  "Based on the evidence provided and the analysis conducted, the verdict for the defendant is **Guilty**."
