  "The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite the presence of other injuries, is rare in cases of smothering. However, as there are instances where petechiae are not present in cases of smothering, the likelihood of their absence in Ben could be estimated to be around 20%. \n\n20!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite the presence of other injuries suggestive of smothering, would be highly unlikely. Considering the typical signs associated with smothering cases, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben could be estimated to be around 5%.\n\n5!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which are common findings in natural deaths or could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, would be more likely. Considering these factors, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben despite Jane's innocence could be estimated to be around 60%.\n\n60!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in the autopsy findings would be less likely, as these findings are more commonly associated with natural deaths or post-mortem occurrences. In the scenario where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben could be estimated to be around 20%.\n\n20!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Andy, and the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of these injuries being consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby, would be higher. In the absence of guilt, the injuries found in Andy would likely be a result of resuscitation efforts. Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries being consistent with resuscitation could be estimated to be around 80%.\n\n80!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found on Andy that were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts may have been caused by the act of smothering. If Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Andy being a result of smothering rather than resuscitation attempts could be estimated to be around 70%.\n\n70!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, and considering that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is more likely that these injuries were not present when he was initially brought in. In the absence of guilt, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present at the time he was brought to the hospital could be estimated to be around 85%.\n\n85!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is less likely that these injuries were not present when he was initially brought in. In the scenario where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben being absent when he was brought to the hospital could be estimated to be around 20%.\n\n20!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Andy, and given that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it would be highly unlikely for these specific injuries to be present in Andy if Jane is innocent. In this context, the likelihood of the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is not guilty could be estimated to be around 5%.\n\n5!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, and considering that the bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present in Andy would be high in the scenario where Jane is guilty. In this context, the likelihood of the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy if Jane is guilty could be estimated to be around 95%.\n\n95!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, and given that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, the likelihood of these specific findings in Ben if Jane is innocent would be very low. In the absence of guilt, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids could be estimated to be around 5%.\n\n5!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and considering that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, it is highly likely that these specific findings would be present in Ben if Jane is indeed guilty. In the scenario where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids could be estimated to be around 90%.\n\n90!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, and given the allegation by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, it is more likely that in the absence of guilt, the hypoxic damage was indeed caused close to the time of death. Therefore, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty could be estimated to be around 80%.\n\n80!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and considering the allegation by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, it is probable that in the scenario where Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage was indeed caused shortly before Ben's death. In this context, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is guilty could be estimated to be around 90%.\n\n90!!!",
  "If Jane is not guilty of smothering both children, and considering the similarities between both incidents such as the age of the babies when they died, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, it would be less likely for these similarities to occur coincidentally. In the absence of guilt, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents would be relatively low, and could be estimated to be around 10%.\n\n10!!!",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, and considering the striking similarities between both incidents including the age of the babies at the time of death, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, it is highly likely that these similarities are not purely coincidental but rather significant indicators of a pattern of behavior. In the scenario where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents could be estimated to be around 90%.\n\n90!!!",
  "Based on the provided evidence in the case of the two children's deaths, including the injuries found on the children, the similarities between the incidents, and the various forensic findings, the probability that the defendant is guilty could be estimated to be around 95%.\n\n95!!!",
  "Guilty."
