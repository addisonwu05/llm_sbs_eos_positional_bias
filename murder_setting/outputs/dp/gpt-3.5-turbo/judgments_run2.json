  "Based on the information provided, and considering the possible explanations such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the common findings in natural deaths, it is unlikely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty. \n\nProbability Judgment: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben would be more likely as they could indicate signs of physical harm inflicted on the child.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Given the absence of typical indicators of smothering such as petechiae and considering the possibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as an alternative explanation, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that injuries such as petechiae would be absent in Ben.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in Ben could still occur due to various factors like the method of smothering or the lack of pressure applied, despite the presence of other injuries indicating harm.\n\nProbability Judgment: 60",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is possible that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, which could indicate that these injuries might have occurred after he was initially brought in and were not immediately noticeable by the nurses.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is likely that the injuries found on him were already present when he was brought to the hospital, as smothering typically causes immediate harm and these injuries would have been evident at the time of admission.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and considering that the injuries found in Andy had initially been attributed to resuscitation attempts, it is likely that these injuries were indeed a result of the efforts to revive him, especially given the context of a medical emergency involving an infant.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found on Andy could be indicative of physical harm inflicted intentionally rather than being solely attributed to resuscitation attempts.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and considering the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, it is likely that this damage could have occurred for reasons other than intentional harm, such as a medical condition or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is higher, as this could be a result of intentional actions to harm the child.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and considering that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found upon re-examination of Andy's death are suggestive of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it is less likely that these specific injuries would be present in Andy without foul play.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the likelihood of finding bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung increases significantly as these are indicative of abuse and consistent with smothering actions.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being at a similar age when they died, passing away at similar times of the day after feeding, and being found unconscious by Jane while she was alone with them, would be lower given the circumstances surrounding sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the potential coincidental nature of these similarities.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the likelihood of there being these striking similarities between both incidents, including the babies being around the same age at the time of death, both passing away after being fed at similar times of the day, and both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would be higher as these circumstances could indicate a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the possibility that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are not indicative of intentional harm like smothering, the likelihood of these findings being present due to other non-abusive factors is higher.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present is higher as these are consistent with the effects of smothering or other violent trauma.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Given the totality of the evidence presented, including the specific injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, and the medical findings pointing towards intentional harm such as smothering, it appears that there is a higher probability of the defendant being guilty.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
  "Guilty"
