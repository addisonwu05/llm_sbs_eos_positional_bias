  "Given the injuries found in Andy are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby, the likelihood of those injuries occurring in such a situation is considered high. Therefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability of these injuries being found in Andy is 90.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the injuries found in Andy suggest deliberate harm caused by smothering. Therefore, in this scenario, the probability of these injuries being found in Andy is 100.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are likely due to natural causes or occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation. Therefore, in this scenario, the probability of these findings being present in Ben is 80.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben suggests intentional harm or smothering. Therefore, in this scenario, the probability of these findings being present in Ben is 100.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is lower. However, given that the injuries were not noted by nurses upon arrival, the probability of these injuries not being present at that time would be 40.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the injuries found on Ben were likely present before he was brought to the hospital as a result of deliberate harm. In this scenario, the probability of the injuries not being present when he arrived at the hospital is 10.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and considering the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering like petechiae in Ben, the likelihood of these injuries not being present is higher. In this scenario, the probability of the absence of such injuries in Ben is 70.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and considering the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering like petechiae in Ben, it is less likely that these injuries would be absent given the deliberate harm suggested. In this scenario, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is 20.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of Andy having bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is lower as these findings are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. In this scenario, the probability of these injuries being present in Andy is 10.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be highly likely given the indications of abuse and smothering. In this scenario, the probability of these injuries being present in Andy is 100.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of there being such striking similarities between both incidents, including the age of the babies at the time of death, the timing of their deaths, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, is relatively low. In this scenario, the probability of these similarities occurring by chance is 20.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the presence of these striking similarities between both incidents, including the age of the babies at the time of death, the timing of their deaths, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, is highly probable due to the intentional actions leading to such outcomes. In this scenario, the probability of these similarities occurring deliberately is 100.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is lower, as it would suggest an acute event occurring close to the time of death. Considering the lack of immediate evidence pointing to such a scenario, the likelihood is around 30.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is higher, as intentional harm or smothering could lead to such brain injury shortly before the fatal outcome. In this scenario, the probability of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is 80.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the presence of haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids without being caused by smothering or other violent trauma is low. Given the significance of these findings, the probability of such occurrences in the absence of foul play is around 10.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the presence of haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being caused by smothering or other violent trauma is significantly higher. Considering the nature of these injuries in the context of intentional harm, the probability of such occurrences is 90.",
  "Based on the evidence provided, including the injuries consistent with smothering, the similarities between the incidents, and the presence of findings suggestive of deliberate harm, the probability that the defendant is guilty is 95.",
  "Based on the evidence presented and the probability analysis, the verdict for the defendant is **Guilty**."
