Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This is a strong indicator of foul play.\n*   **Injuries on both children:** The injuries found on both Andy and Ben, particularly the additional injuries found upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photos, are concerning. While some injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts, others (bruises, torn frenulum, hypoxic damage) are consistent with abuse and/or smothering.\n*   **Lack of Alternative Explanations for All Findings:** While SIDS is a possibility, it doesn't fully explain all the injuries, especially the ones considered characteristic of smothering.\n\n**Factors suggesting innocence:**\n\n*   **SIDS possibility:** The possibility of SIDS cannot be completely ruled out.\n*   **Injuries explained by resuscitation:** Some injuries *could* be explained by resuscitation attempts, creating doubt about the extent of intentional harm.\n*   **Absence of Petechiae in Ben:** This is a point in favor of innocence, as Petechiae are typical injuries in a smothering case.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe similarities between the deaths and the evidence of injuries suggestive of smothering weigh heavily towards guilt.
