  "If Jane is not guilty, and Andy's injuries were due to resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of those injuries occurring depends on the intensity and nature of the resuscitation efforts. Given the initial assumption that resuscitation caused the injuries, the probability is reasonably high.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) would be a direct result of her actions. The likelihood of these specific injuries being present if she smothered him would be quite high, as smothering could cause these types of injuries.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben's death is potentially due to SIDS or some other natural cause that doesn't involve smothering. In such scenarios, the absence of petechiae or other typical smothering injuries is highly probable.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae, while not conclusive of innocence, makes smothering less certain. Smothering *can* cause petechiae, but it's not always present. Other factors could influence whether they occur.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben's death is likely due to natural causes or possibly SIDS, with resuscitation attempts made. Given that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths and the rib dislocations are likely due to post-mortem changes or resuscitation, the probability of finding these things is relatively high in this scenario.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the spinal bleeding is described as a \"common finding in natural death,\" and the dislocated ribs are likely due to post-mortem or resuscitation attempts. Thus, even if guilty, the presence of these findings isn't necessarily directly linked to the smothering itself. The likelihood is similar to the scenario where she is not guilty, as these findings could still occur regardless of the smothering.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's injuries were either pre-existing (and subtle) or developed rapidly during the event leading to his death (e.g., SIDS or another medical event), or resulted from resuscitation attempts, it's *possible* that they weren't immediately noticeable by nurses upon arrival at the hospital. It is unlikely that major injuries would have been missed.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of inflicting the injuries on Ben shortly before bringing him to the hospital, it's plausible, even likely, that the nurses might not have immediately noticed them, particularly if they were subtle or internal. The nurses would have been focused on resuscitation.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two deaths (age, time of day, finding them unconscious while alone with them) could be attributed to coincidence, though a highly improbable one. Given the low likelihood of SIDS (1 in 4000) and other possibilities combined with the specific similarities, the probability of these similarities occurring purely by chance is low.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the deaths are highly likely because she would have likely employed a similar method or taken advantage of similar circumstances in both instances.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another medical condition, it is likely that the hypoxic damage occurred in the hours immediately preceding his death as his body began to shut down. The hypoxic damage would be a result of whatever caused his death.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, then the hypoxic damage to his brain would be a direct result of her actions in depriving him of oxygen. The doctor stating the damage occurred hours before death supports this.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these injuries is less likely, and would need to be explained by other factors such as resuscitation or undiagnosed medical conditions. Given that these injuries are supposedly \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" their presence despite her innocence would be an anomaly. Therefore, the likelihood is low.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, and these injuries are indeed \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" then their presence becomes highly probable.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these findings would be unexpected, but not impossible, as SIDS can sometimes be associated with unexplained findings. The statement that these are *consistent* with smothering and/or violent trauma reduces the probability, if she is not guilty.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and these findings are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\", then it is highly likely that these symptoms are present.\n\n90\n",
  "Based on the evidence, the similarities in the deaths, the injuries found upon re-examination of Andy, and the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben are all suggestive of foul play. While SIDS is a possibility, the injuries make it less likely. There is no direct evidence that she is guilty, such as a confession or a witness.\n\n75\n",
  "Based solely on the provided information, the evidence points more strongly towards guilt, but there is still some uncertainty. Therefore, I cannot definitively declare a verdict. A real jury would have to weigh all the evidence presented, including evidence not provided here.\n"
