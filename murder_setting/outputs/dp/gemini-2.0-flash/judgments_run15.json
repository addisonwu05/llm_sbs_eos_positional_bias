  "The question asks for a probability judgment about the likelihood of Andy's injuries if Jane is *not guilty*. This means considering how likely those injuries are due to resuscitation efforts, as initially thought. The passage explicitly states that the injuries are consistent with resuscitation, \"especially a baby.\" Given this information, it is reasonably likely that the injuries could have occurred during resuscitation attempts. However, we don't have precise statistical data about the frequency of such injuries during resuscitation. Therefore, I will assign a probability that reflects \"reasonably likely\" without being overwhelmingly certain.\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found could be a combination of the inflicted injuries from smothering and potential injuries from the subsequent, albeit unsuccessful, resuscitation attempts. Smothering could lead to bruising, internal injuries, and the torn frenulum. It is highly plausible that a person who smothers an infant would also inflict other forms of trauma while doing so. The injuries are *consistent* with smothering but do not definitively prove it, and the resuscitation attempts can explain some, but potentially not all, of the injuries. Given that the prosecution is proceeding on the basis of these injuries, they must believe that they are strongly indicative of foul play, and therefore, a guilty verdict would require a high likelihood that the injuries are linked to the smothering.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, and the injuries were not noted by nurses upon arrival at the hospital, this suggests two primary possibilities:\n\n1.  The injuries were *extremely subtle* and difficult to detect, developing either during or shortly after the ambulance ride to the hospital.\n2.  The injuries occurred *during* the attempted resuscitation efforts at the hospital.\n\nIf the injuries were subtle and pre-existing, it's plausible they were missed initially. If they occurred during resuscitation, then, of course, they would not have been present upon arrival.\n\nConsidering that the injuries included rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, some of which would likely have been evident upon arrival, it is quite unlikely they were simply missed. The absence of the injuries upon arrival points strongly to them occurring *during* resuscitation if Jane is innocent. Hence, it's relatively likely that the injuries were not present upon arrival *if* Jane is not guilty.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of inflicting the injuries that caused Ben's death *before* calling the ambulance, it is very unlikely that the injuries would *not* have been present when he arrived at the hospital. The injuries included rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant injuries. If Jane inflicted them, they would almost certainly have been present, to some degree, when Ben arrived at the hospital, even if they worsened afterwards. The nurses not noticing the injuries initially casts doubt on whether the injuries were inflicted before arrival at the hospital. If Jane is guilty, it is more likely that she inflicted some, but not all, of the injuries which were then exacerbated during resuscitation. Therefore, the likelihood that *none* of the injuries were present is relatively low if Jane is guilty, but it is not impossible.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, then Ben's death was likely due to some other cause, possibly SIDS or some other undiagnosed medical condition. In this scenario, the absence of petechiae, which are associated with smothering (a form of asphyxia), is *more* likely. Ben had hypoxic brain damage and other injuries that could be associated with a variety of medical events, and if those were the primary cause of death, the absence of smothering-related injuries like petechiae would be expected. Thus, in the context of Jane's innocence, the absence of petechiae is probable.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae makes her guilt less certain. While petechiae are *associated* with smothering, their absence doesn't automatically rule it out. It's possible that the smothering was done in a way that didn't cause them, or that they were present but not noticed. Other injuries *were* present (ribs, spine, eyes), but the *absence* of petechiae makes the scenario slightly less typical. The absence of petechiae makes the prosecution's case weaker, suggesting an atypical smothering incident, or a misdiagnosis. I will say it is fairly unlikely the injuries were not present given guilt, but not overwhelmingly unlikely.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then we must consider possible natural causes or accidental causes (such as resuscitation efforts). The statement explicitly says:\n\n*   Spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death.\n*   Dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\n\nSince both of these findings are explained plausibly by events *other* than intentional harm by Jane, then it is rather likely that these injuries were found in Ben if Jane is not guilty.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs is still possible, but it introduces some uncertainty. While these injuries could *also* be inflicted during the act of smothering, the provided information states that spinal bleeding is common in natural death and dislocated ribs are likely post-mortem or from resuscitation. This suggests that these specific findings are *not* particularly strong evidence of smothering, but their presence does not rule it out either. They could have occurred naturally *in addition* to the smothering, or the dislocated ribs could be from the attempts to revive Ben after Jane's actions. The information suggests that these findings do not provide substantial proof for or against Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these injuries were found, even if Jane is guilty, is moderate.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then Ben's death was likely due to some other, natural cause. Given that the doctor alleged the hypoxic brain damage occurred hours before death, and we are operating under the assumption that Jane is innocent, then it is fairly certain that this statement is true. Otherwise, the doctor is wrong or misleading the court, which seems less likely.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and she caused Ben's death by smothering him, the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic brain damage occurred a matter of hours before death becomes a crucial piece of evidence. Smothering directly leads to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), and if Jane is responsible for the smothering, the hypoxic damage would indeed have occurred shortly before Ben's death. Thus, the doctor's statement is highly consistent with Jane's guilt. However, the timing is based on an allegation, and could be imprecise or even incorrect. However, if the doctor's testimony is considered reliable, it strongly supports the prosecution's case. I am assuming that the doctor is not lying, but their allegation might be imprecise.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, the striking similarities between the two deaths are highly unusual and statistically improbable, but not impossible. If both deaths were due to SIDS or another undiagnosed medical condition, it would be a rare and unfortunate coincidence for the following similarities to occur:\n\n*   Both babies were approximately the same age.\n*   Both died at a similar time of day after being fed.\n*   Jane was alone with them in both instances when they were found unconscious.\n\nWhile SIDS does have some correlation with age, the other factors happening twice is highly statistically unlikely. Therefore it is quite unlikely these similarities occurred by chance, even if Jane is not guilty.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two deaths become much more readily explainable and, therefore, much more likely. The similarities provide a strong indication of a common cause, and if that cause is Jane's deliberate actions, the \"coincidences\" cease to be coincidences at all. If Jane intentionally killed both children, it is extremely probable that the circumstances would be similar: She would likely choose a time when she was alone with the baby, after feeding (perhaps to calm the baby), and target infants of similar age, perhaps because they are more vulnerable. The similarities become evidence of a pattern.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages must have occurred due to some other cause. The statement notes they are *consistent* with smothering *and/or other violent trauma*. Since we're assuming Jane's innocence, we need to consider other possibilities. It does not state that these types of injuries can only come from smothering or violent trauma. The fact that resuscitation was attempted leaves open the possibility that violent trauma inadvertently occurred during these procedures.\n\nThus, if Jane is innocent, it becomes significantly *less* likely that Ben would have those injuries. It's not *impossible*, but requires a combination of other, less obvious factors, or resuscitation attempts to blame.\n\n25\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering Ben, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids aligns directly with the expected consequences of that action, as the statement says that they are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. Therefore, it is very likely that these were found if Jane is guilty.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy becomes much less likely. The statement explicitly indicates that these findings are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" Thus, these injuries are highly suggestive of intentional harm, which would contradict the assumption of Jane's innocence. If SIDS were the cause, or a natural death, these injuries would not be typically present. It is possible that resuscitation could account for some injuries, but the statement suggests all these injuries are characteristic of abuse.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering Andy, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung become much more likely. The statement explicitly says that these findings \"are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" Therefore, the injuries directly support the accusation and strongly suggest that foul play occurred.\n\n90\n",
  "This is a complex case with conflicting evidence. The strongest factors suggesting guilt are:\n\n*   The similarities between the two incidents are astonishing and improbable if Jane is innocent.\n*   The injuries found on both babies are indicative of abuse and/or consistent with smothering.\n*   The allegation by the doctor of the hypoxic damage timing in Ben's death.\n\nFactors that weaken the case for guilt are:\n\n*   Some injuries could be explained by resuscitation efforts.\n*   The spinal bleeding found in Ben is common in natural deaths.\n*   The dislocated ribs found in Ben probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\n*   Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben.\n\nOverall, the similarities of the two incidents and the fact that some injuries are indicative of abuse suggests a high likelihood of guilt, and overcomes the doubt raised by other facts.\n\n80\n",
  "Based solely on the information provided, and without the ability to assess witness credibility or other factors present in a real trial, the evidence suggests a high probability of guilt. However, probability is not certainty.\n\nTherefore, the verdict is: Likely Guilty.\n"
