  "Given the information, we need to assess the likelihood of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben *if* Jane is innocent (i.e., the death was due to natural causes, potentially SIDS).\n\nThe passage states: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\"\n\nSince spinal bleeding is \"common\" in natural deaths, and dislocated ribs \"probably\" occurred due to post-mortem handling or resuscitation, then, assuming a natural death, the probability of these findings seems reasonably high. \"Common\" and \"probably\" don't equate to certainty, but suggest a substantial likelihood.\n\nTherefore, I'd estimate:\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could still be present, albeit for different reasons or with altered probabilities. The spinal bleeding could occur due to the trauma of smothering, even though it is also found in natural death. The dislocated ribs could also be caused by the smothering, although the passage states the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Since smothering might involve forceful actions, the chance of these findings is still considerable, but potentially less probable than if the death were natural.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS (or another natural cause), the absence of petechiae, which are typical of smothering, would be highly likely. Natural infant death would not typically involve injuries associated with external asphyxiation.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the *absence* of petechiae is less likely than if he died of natural causes. Petechiae are considered a sign of asphyxia, including smothering, though their absence doesn't definitively rule it out. Several factors could influence whether petechiae are present or detected. So, while not guaranteed, smothering *could* still occur without petechiae being evident. The probability would be less than 50% as petechiae is a typical injury.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause requiring resuscitation, and given that \"Andy's injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby,\" then the likelihood of those injuries being present is high.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung) could be present either due to the act of smothering *or* the subsequent resuscitation attempts (or a combination). It is stated that these injuries are consistent with resuscitation. Since smothering would likely be followed by attempted resuscitation, the likelihood of these injuries being present is still high, though perhaps slightly lower than if the initial cause was natural requiring resuscitation.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes (e.g., SIDS), some injuries (spinal bleeding, dislocated ribs) might have occurred *during* the process of dying or during the resuscitation attempts. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses upon arrival suggests they developed later or were subtle enough to be missed initially. Therefore, it is plausible (but not certain) the injuries were absent or not readily apparent when Ben was first brought to the hospital.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it's likely that at least *some* of the injuries were inflicted during the act of smothering, *before* he arrived at the hospital. However, it's also possible that some of the injuries (like dislocated ribs) occurred *during* resuscitation attempts *after* arriving at the hospital. The spinal bleeding is said to be found in natural deaths, so could have occurred during the act of smothering. Given that some injuries would likely pre-exist hospital arrival, and that nurses did not note them, the chance they were absent or not readily visible is lower than if it were a natural death.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS (or another natural cause), hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death is certainly plausible. SIDS involves a sudden cessation of breathing, leading to oxygen deprivation. Therefore, if it's a natural death, it's fairly likely the hypoxic damage happened relatively close to the time of death.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic brain damage would be a *direct* consequence of the smothering, which would induce oxygen deprivation. Thus, the brain damage occurring hours before death is highly probable. The time frame is strongly linked to the smothering event.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is *not* guilty, then Ben's death was due to natural causes (conceivably SIDS). The statement says the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Therefore, if death was natural, these findings are *less* likely, though not impossible, as SIDS can present in various ways and resuscitation efforts can cause trauma.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma,\" then the likelihood of these findings is high. The act of smothering directly causes oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), and the force used could cause hemorrhages.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Andy died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is far less likely. These injuries are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If the death was natural, these findings would be unexpected and suggest a misinterpretation of the evidence. Resuscitation *might* cause some trauma, but the description makes clear these are more linked to abuse.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" then the presence of these injuries is highly probable. They are direct consequences of the inflicted harm.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and both babies died of SIDS (or other natural causes), then the similarities described - age, time of day, being recently fed, and Jane being the one to find them - become a matter of statistical probability. While SIDS has risk factors (age being one), the other similarities happening by chance seems less likely. It is difficult to assign a probability, but it will be more than negligible.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities in the circumstances of both deaths are highly likely to be deliberate. She would likely repeat a similar pattern of actions to carry out the murders, and would want to be in a similar position to maintain plausible deniability.\n\n95\n",
  "Weighing all the evidence, the similarities in the deaths, the injuries found upon re-examination of Andy's case that are \"indicative of abuse,\" and the hypoxia and hemorrhages in Ben that are \"consistent with smothering,\" point to a higher probability of guilt. While SIDS is a possibility, the combination of factors makes it less likely than intentional harm.\n\n80\n",
  "Based on the evaluation of the evidence, and with a probability of guilt estimated at 80%, my verdict would be:\n\nGuilty\n"
