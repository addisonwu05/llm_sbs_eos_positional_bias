  "Given the information, the spinal bleeding could have been a natural death, and the dislocated ribs occurred during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem. If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes (potentially SIDS or something else), then it's quite plausible these findings would be present. There is no information about how often spinal bleeding occurs in natural death, so it is hard to quantify. Assuming it is not a very rare occurance, then the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are found in Ben if Jane is not guilty is above 50.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is still possible that spinal bleeding could occur, although perhaps less likely than in a natural death scenario. The dislocated ribs, as stated, likely resulted from resuscitation attempts, which would occur regardless of the cause of death. So, the fact that these findings are present doesn't necessarily preclude guilt. It's still reasonably likely they would be found.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes (such as SIDS), the absence of petechiae, which are indicative of smothering, would be highly likely.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of typical injuries like petechiae would be less likely, but not impossible. The effectiveness of the smothering, the exact method used, and individual physiological factors could all influence whether or not petechiae would be present. Since petechiae are *typical* but not *always* present, it's still plausible they'd be absent, but less probable.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes (like SIDS), it's possible the spinal bleeding wasn't visible externally. The dislocated ribs, as stated, probably occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation. Therefore, it's quite likely that the injuries were not immediately apparent to the nurses upon arrival at the hospital.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, and the injuries (rib fractures, spinal bleeding, hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages) were caused by her actions, it becomes less likely that these injuries were not present when Ben arrived at the hospital. While some injuries may not be immediately obvious, the fact that *no* injuries were noted by medical professionals who would have examined the baby reduces the probability. The spinal bleeding may or may not have been visible externally. However, the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are more likely to be noticed, as well as any bruising, therefore a lack of notation by the nurses means it is less likely.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Andy likely died of SIDS or another natural cause. Resuscitation attempts were made, and the injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are consistent with those attempts, especially on a fragile baby. Therefore, given the attempts to revive Andy, finding these injuries is reasonably likely.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts doesn't necessarily contradict her guilt. Resuscitation would still have been attempted after she smothered him. Therefore, the injuries found are still reasonably likely to be present even if she is guilty. There might be *additional* injuries from the smothering that are masked by the resuscitation injuries, or the resuscitation injuries might be the only ones present.\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages is less likely, given the statement that these are consistent with smothering and/or violent trauma. While a natural event *could* potentially cause these, it's less probable than if foul play was involved.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids becomes much more likely, as these findings are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and Ben died of SIDS or another natural cause, the likelihood of hypoxic damage occurring *hours* before death becomes quite low. SIDS is characterized by sudden, unexpected death. While hypoxic events *could* precede death in some natural scenarios, the fact that it was hours before death points towards something other than a sudden event.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic damage occurring hours before death aligns well with the likely timeline of events. The act of smothering would induce hypoxia, leading to brain damage, and the fact that it occurred hours before death supports the prosecution's case. Therefore, the probability is high.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the existence of these similarities is quite low. While SIDS could occur in both infants, the convergence of all these factors (age, time of day after feeding, Jane being alone with them) strains credulity. It's improbable for these independent events to align so closely purely by chance.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the incidents become highly probable. These similarities suggest a pattern of behavior, aligning with a deliberate act. The controlled circumstances (age, time after feeding, alone with Jane) likely provided Jane with opportunities to act.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, becomes very unlikely. While resuscitation efforts could account for *some* injuries, the combination and nature of these specific injuries make a natural cause improbable.\n\n5\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of these injuries, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, is highly probable. They directly support the prosecution's case.\n\n90\n",
  "Considering all the information, the evidence strongly suggests Jane is guilty. The similarities between the deaths, the specific injuries found on both children, the temporal proximity of the hypoxic damage to Ben's death, and the implausibility of natural causes explaining all these factors create a compelling case. The injuries on Andy, initially attributed to resuscitation, now point towards abuse.\n\n90\n",
  "Based on the provided information, my assessment is that the defendant is **Guilty**.\n"
