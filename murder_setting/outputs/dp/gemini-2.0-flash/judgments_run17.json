  "The question asks about the likelihood of Andy's injuries *if* Jane is NOT guilty. This means the injuries were caused by something other than Jane intentionally inflicting them. The scenario already states that the injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries are *reasonably* likely to have occurred during attempts to revive Andy. We are not told how severe the resuscitation was or how likely injuries of this kind are to be caused by it.\n\nGiven that it is stated that the injuries are consistent with the resuscitation efforts and that we are supposing Jane is innocent, it is reasonably likely that Andy's injuries came about as a result of attempts to resuscitate. Given the information, it is reasonable to estimate this at 70%.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found during the subsequent review of the autopsy photographs are *very* likely to be a result of her actions. While some injuries could be due to resuscitation attempts, the presence of bruises on the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung suggests a more forceful and deliberate act of violence. If Jane smothered Andy, these injuries are more probable than if she were innocent. It is highly likely the injuries are connected to the act of smothering, even though some resuscitation-related injuries may also be present.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then Ben's death was due to other causes. We're told spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation. Therefore, if Jane is innocent, it's quite likely that these findings would be present. Given the provided information, this scenario seems plausible.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of harming Ben (presumably by smothering, as alleged), the finding of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs becomes less certain. While the spinal bleeding is stated as a common finding in natural death, it *could* also be a consequence of inflicted trauma. The dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem causes or resuscitation. If Jane is guilty of actively causing Ben's death, the presence of these specific findings is not guaranteed to be directly caused by her actions. It depends on how she caused the death. However, the spinal bleeding could be related to some degree of trauma associated with a smothering.\n\nTherefore, it is more difficult to say how likely these findings are if Jane is guilty. The spinal bleeding is common in natural death and the dislocated ribs are probably due to resuscitation or post-mortem handling. This suggests they are more likely linked to something *other* than the action of smothering.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then Ben's death was due to something other than smothering. Therefore, the *absence* of injuries typical of smothering (like petechiae) would be highly likely. The absence of such injuries would be *expected* if the cause of death was something else.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane *is* guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae becomes more significant and casts doubt on the smothering theory. While petechiae may not always be present in smothering cases, their absence makes smothering a less likely cause of death. It is difficult to assign a definitive probability, but it reduces the likelihood that the death was due to smothering. If smothering were the cause, one might expect *some* evidence of it, such as petechiae. Because of that I would consider it less likely than not (below 50%)\n40\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, it means that Ben's injuries occurred due to other causes or post-mortem. If the injuries were not noted by nurses at the hospital, it suggests that either the injuries were subtle and not readily apparent, or they occurred *after* Ben was brought to the hospital (e.g., during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem). If Ben's condition deteriorated rapidly and resuscitation efforts were extensive, some injuries could have been inflicted during that process. If the nurses did not notice them, it suggests that these injuries were possibly not pre-existing and obvious. I estimate 65% because the injuries found could have developed during or following the arrival at the hospital.\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of inflicting the injuries that led to Ben's death (presumably through smothering), it is *less* likely that those injuries were not present when he arrived at the hospital. If she inflicted the injuries, they would have to be there for him to then deteriorate and need to be taken to the hospital. While some injuries *could* have been subtle or not immediately noticeable, the fact that a later autopsy revealed rib and spinal cord injuries suggests that at least *some* of the injuries should have been present, even if not immediately obvious to the nurses. Perhaps not all, so there is a chance that some injuries occurred *after* arrival at the hospital.\n\n35\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then Andy's injuries were *not* caused by her intentionally harming him. The question states that these specific injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. Therefore, if Jane is innocent, the likelihood of these injuries being present is *low*. It would require some other explanation for injuries that are strongly associated with abuse, so it would have to be an unusual circumstance.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane IS guilty of smothering Andy, and the description states that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are *indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering*, then the presence of these injuries would be highly probable. If she did smother Andy, and these are signs of smothering, it is very probable they are present.\n\n90\n",
  "The question explores the probability of the coincidences, assuming Jane is innocent. If Jane is innocent, then these similarities are just coincidences. While rare, coincidences *do* happen. The question is how likely it is that these *specific* coincidences occurred. Given the rarity of SIDS and the additional coincidences, these circumstances happening independently are unusual, but must be possible. The fact that SIDS is more common in boys makes the first similar factor slightly more likely. But it is a series of coinciding rare events.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the similarities become much less coincidental and point towards a deliberate pattern of behavior. She is controlling the circumstances so the similarities are highly likely, and very much intentional.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, then Ben's death was caused by something other than intentional harm inflicted by her. The information provided states that hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes/eyelids are consistent with smothering *or other violent trauma*. Since we are assuming Jane is innocent, we must consider whether other violent trauma (accidental trauma causing oxygen deprivation) or some natural cause could account for these findings. This is a difficult determination given the information. It seems more likely if these findings are consistent with smothering that the death involved some external trauma. We can then estimate the probability that this trauma caused the injuries noted. SIDS would likely not cause such injuries.\n\nThe given information states the injuries are consistent with smothering *or* other violent trauma. It is possible some other incident could have caused the trauma, so there is some reasonable possibility that trauma, accidental or otherwise, occurred to Ben if Jane is innocent, causing the injuries described. Because accidental, non-SIDS death of an infant due to trauma is unlikely, my estimate will be fairly low.\n\n25\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering Ben, and the provided information states that hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are *consistent* with smothering, then it is reasonable to conclude that the presence of these injuries would be quite likely. It is not definitive since they are not always present in smothering. It makes it more probable if she caused the death by violence, and she smothered him, these injuries would be likely to be found.\n85\n",
  "If Jane is NOT guilty, we must consider what other cause of death (other than intentional smothering) could have led to hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death. We need a scenario where some event leads to a rapid deprivation of oxygen that damages the brain. If Jane is innocent, a rapid, unexpected health crisis could explain this, so, the probability could be based on the likelihood of sudden organ failure in an infant.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering Ben, and the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death, this aligns with a smothering scenario. The time frame supports the allegation that she inflicted the damage leading to his death shortly before he was found.\n\n90\n",
  "This is a complex case with conflicting evidence. Here's a breakdown of factors influencing a guilt assessment:\n\n**Factors Suggesting Guilt:**\n\n*   **The injuries:** The re-examined autopsy findings for Andy, including bruises, a torn frenulum, and lung blood, are suggestive of abuse and smothering.\n*   **Similarities between deaths:** The age of the babies, the timing of the deaths after feeding, and Jane being alone with them create a disturbing pattern.\n*   **Injuries consistent with smothering:** The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages are consistent with smothering.\n*   **Hypoxic brain damage timing:** That the damage to Ben's brain occurred hours before death supports the idea of a recent deliberate action.\n\n**Factors Suggesting Innocence:**\n\n*   **SIDS possibility:** Although lessens the probability, it is a factor to consider.\n*   **Injuries from resuscitation:** Some injuries *could* be explained by resuscitation attempts.\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** The spinal bleeding in Ben is common in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could be post-mortem or due to resuscitation.\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** The absence of petechiae in Ben is not a sign of death due to smothering.\n*   **Injuries not initially noted:** That the nurses didn't note injuries on Ben raises the possibility they weren't present upon arrival at the hospital.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe prosecution has a strong case built around the injuries, the similarities, and medical opinions that the injuries are consistent with smothering. However, the defense has viable counter-arguments regarding alternative explanations for some injuries and the possibility of SIDS.\n\nWeighing the totality of the evidence, the similarities in the deaths are statistically significant and raise substantial suspicion, as do the confirmed injuries from re-examination of Andy's autopsy. The most impactful evidence comes from the medical findings (brain damage, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), combined with doctor opinions about when the brain damage was inflicted.\n\nBased on the evidence presented, it is likely that the defendant is guilty.\n\n75\n",
