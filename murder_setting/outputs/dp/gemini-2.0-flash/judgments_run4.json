  "The question asks about the likelihood of Ben's injuries *not* being present when he arrived at the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty. If Jane is innocent, then the injuries were likely caused by something else. Given that the injuries were not noticed by nurses, it suggests they were either very subtle, happened very shortly before death, or were internally located (like spinal cord damage or haemorrhages). It's possible that the process of attempted resuscitation could have caused or worsened some of the injuries.\n\nGiven these possibilities, it's plausible that the injuries were either very recent or internal and thus not immediately apparent to the nurses when Ben arrived. Therefore, it's reasonably possible that the injuries noted during the autopsy were either absent or much less severe at the time of hospital admission.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, it implies she inflicted the injuries leading to Ben's death. In this scenario, it is highly likely the injuries were present when Ben arrived at the hospital, as they would be the direct cause of his distress and subsequent death. It would be improbable for Jane to inflict fatal injuries *after* bringing Ben to the hospital. Thus, it's very unlikely that the injuries were *not* present at the time of arrival.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then the injuries found on Andy were likely due to some other cause. The provided text indicates that the injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and that these injuries are *consistent* with such attempts. This implies a plausible, alternative explanation for the injuries. Furthermore, it mentions SIDS as a possible cause of death, and the frantic attempts to revive a baby during a SIDS event could definitely result in injuries. Given that the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes, it lends further weight to the plausibility that the injuries stemmed from resuscitation efforts.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found on Andy were inflicted by her. While the injuries *could* also be consistent with resuscitation attempts, the likelihood they stem *solely* from those attempts decreases significantly if Jane is responsible for his death. She may have inflicted additional injuries on top of any that resulted from resuscitation, or the resuscitation efforts may have exacerbated injuries she had already caused. However, it's still *possible* some injuries were due to resuscitation.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death was due to something other than smothering. Since the question highlights that *typical* injuries of smothering (petechiae) were absent, then their absence aligns perfectly with Jane's innocence and a cause of death other than smothering. Thus, the absence of these injuries is highly likely.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the *absence* of typical signs of smothering, like petechiae, makes her guilt less certain, but not impossible. Smothering doesn't always present with petechiae, and there could be other reasons why they weren't present or detected. The exact method of smothering could influence whether petechiae occur.\n\nTherefore, the absence of petechiae is somewhat unusual if she's guilty, but not entirely improbable.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben died of natural causes or due to complications during resuscitation. The text directly states that the spinal bleeding is *common* in natural death and the dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation. Therefore, the presence of these findings is expected and highly probable.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs probably being caused post-mortem or during resuscitation are still relevant factors. These findings could still be present alongside injuries caused by smothering. It doesn't make the findings impossible, just potentially less indicative of a natural death. Therefore, given that spinal bleeding is common in natural death, and the dislocated ribs are likely from resuscitation (which would still occur), the presence of these findings isn't incredibly unusual even if she is guilty.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities are due to chance or some other shared factor. SIDS, for instance, is more common in a specific age range. The fact that she fed them prior could be a coincidence or related to their sleep schedule. However, the fact that she was *always* alone with them when they were found unconscious is the most striking similarity and stretches the realm of coincidence, even if SIDS is the underlying cause. It suggests that there is still some correlation that could indicate otherwise, and a large amount of similarities would cause suspicions.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, then the similarities between the two incidents become much more likely and indicative of a pattern. The fact that the babies were the same age, died at similar times after feeding, and she was always alone with them strongly suggests a deliberate act. Therefore, given her guilt, the presence of these similarities is highly probable.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then these findings must be explained by something other than abuse or smothering. Given the statement says the findings are *indicative* of abuse and *characteristic* of smothering, their presence is less likely under the assumption of Jane's innocence. While resuscitation *could* potentially cause some of these, the combination suggests another explanation that goes against Jane being innocent. It's still *possible* they were caused by something else, even if unlikely.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, then the presence of these injuries, which are described as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, becomes highly likely. The injuries directly support the prosecution's case.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben's death was due to some other cause. The fact that the hypoxic brain damage occurred just hours before death narrows down the potential causes and, therefore, the likelihood that it occurred in this timeframe. It suggests a sudden event or rapid deterioration of health. Given the possible causes would include things such as SIDS or a cardiac arrest, the brain damage would likely occur very close to the death. The brain damage occurring close to death helps narrow the search for the non-guilty cause.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic brain damage would be a direct result of her actions, and it would logically occur in the hours leading up to his death. The timeline fits the scenario.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then these findings must be explained by something other than smothering or violent trauma. The statement clearly says the findings are consistent with these violent causes; therefore, their presence is less likely if Jane is innocent. Resuscitation *might* explain some of the findings, but not necessarily all. It is possible that an undiagnosed medical condition caused these symptoms, and the doctors were unsure.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, findings consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, becomes highly likely. These findings support the assertion of her guilt.\n\n90\n",
  "Based on the evidence, the similarities between the deaths are striking and difficult to dismiss as pure coincidence, especially Jane always being alone with the children when they became unconscious. The injuries found on both children, while potentially explainable by resuscitation efforts, are also indicative of abuse and smothering. While some individual pieces of evidence could be explained away, the totality of the circumstances weighs heavily against Jane. The absence of petechiae in Ben, while atypical for smothering, does not entirely negate the other evidence. Given that the injuries found during the re-examination of Andy point to abuse and smothering, and the circumstances surrounding both deaths are eerily similar, it points to guilt.\n\n80\n",
  "Based on the balance of probabilities and the evidence presented, the verdict is GUILTY.\n"
