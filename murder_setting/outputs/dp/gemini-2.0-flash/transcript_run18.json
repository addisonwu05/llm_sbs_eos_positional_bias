Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Bruises to the arms and legs of Andy, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are also not external injuries.\n*   **Competence of medical staff:** It depends on the assessment skills and experience of the medical staff, especially if the babies were not examined extensively.\n*   **Time elapsed:** Internal injuries may take time to manifest externally (e.g., bruising becomes more pronounced over time).\n*   **Post-mortem artifacts:** It's possible, though less likely, that some injuries could be post-mortem artifacts created during the autopsy process, but this would usually be noted.\n*   **Explanation of lack of notation:** It needs to be considered that notes are a reflection of an assessment at a point in time. If the injuries were not clear or not focused on by nurses at the time of assessment (given their focus was resuscitation and that these injuries were internal), then their notes may not reflect them.\n\nGiven that nurses, in their notes, did not note the injuries, one can deduce that they were not obvious to spot, or they were missed, which is plausible. Therefore, I would say that the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is quite low, but not zero, and it may be more accurate to say that they were not obvious at the time.\n\n5\n"

The injuries are more consistent with intentional harm than with SIDS alone, especially in light of both deaths being similar.\n\nThe medical evidence is not conclusive, but it leans more towards foul play than purely natural causes. It's also important to acknowledge that medical science isn't always definitive, and some conditions can be difficult to diagnose with certainty.\n\n**Probability Judgment:**\n\nGiven the combination of the suspicious circumstances and the injuries, I assess the probability of guilt to be higher than 50%.\n\n75\n"
