Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "This is a complex question that requires careful consideration. Here's a breakdown of the factors to weigh and how they influence a probability estimate:\n\n*   **Nature of the injuries:** The injuries found on Ben are significant: rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages. These are not minor or easily overlooked issues.\n*   **Hospital procedures:** Hospitals have protocols for examining infants brought in unresponsive. Nurses are trained to look for signs of trauma.\n*   **Timeline:** The question doesn't specify *how long* Ben was at the hospital before death, or *how thorough* the initial exam was. A quick assessment in a crisis situation might miss subtle signs that a more detailed post-mortem examination would reveal.\n*   **Documentation:** The absence of notes doesn't definitively mean the injuries *weren't* there. It could be an oversight, incomplete documentation, or the injuries weren't as obvious upon initial examination.\n*   **Alternative Explanations:** If Jane is not guilty, we must consider alternative scenarios, for instance a rare congenital condition that went unnoticed.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems *unlikely* that such significant injuries were present but entirely missed by medical professionals during their initial assessment. But considering there's no documentation of the injuries in the beginning, and Jane is assumed to be NOT GUILTY, there could have been some condition that manifested and caused these injuries. So let's assume that it would be unlikely that these injuries were present.\n\nProbability: 10\n"
