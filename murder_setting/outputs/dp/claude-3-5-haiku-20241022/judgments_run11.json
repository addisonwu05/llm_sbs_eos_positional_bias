  "Let's analyze this carefully:\n\n1. Ben's autopsy revealed several significant injuries:\n- Rib and spinal cord injuries\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n- Hemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n\n2. However, petechiae (tiny red/purple spots typically associated with smothering) were absent.\n\n3. Key considerations:\n- The absence of petechiae doesn't definitively rule out smothering\n- Not all smothering cases produce identical injury patterns\n- Some medical experts note that petechiae can be variable\n\n4. Statistical perspective:\n- Two infant deaths in same family is extremely rare\n- SIDS occurs in 1/4,000 cases\n- Consecutive SIDS deaths are even more statistically improbable\n\n5. Additional context from the case suggests non-accidental injuries were suspected due to Ben's specific injuries\n\n6. While the absence of petechiae introduces some uncertainty, it does not conclusively prove innocence given the other observed injuries\n\nConsidering the complexity of forensic evidence and medical nuance, the probability that the absence of petechiae indicates Jane's non-guilt is relatively low.\n\nProbability: 25",
  "Let's analyze this carefully:\n\n1. Ben's autopsy revealed significant injuries consistent with potential trauma:\n- Rib and spinal cord injuries\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n- Hemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n\n2. Petechiae are not always present in smothering cases:\n- Medical literature shows variability in injury presentation\n- Not all smothering incidents produce identical forensic evidence\n- Absence of petechiae does not definitively rule out intentional suffocation\n\n3. The specific injuries found suggest active harm:\n- Multiple systemic injuries indicate deliberate, non-accidental trauma\n- Injuries are inconsistent with natural causes or SIDS\n\n4. Forensic pathology recognizes that injury patterns can vary widely\n- Smothering can cause death through multiple mechanisms\n- Not all mechanisms predictably produce the same external signs\n\n5. Expert testimony often acknowledges that absence of one specific injury type does not negate overall evidence of intentional harm\n\nConsidering the comprehensive forensic evidence and the specific nature of Ben's injuries, the probability that the absence of petechiae is consistent with Jane's guilt is quite high.\n\nProbability: 80",
  "Let's carefully analyze this claim:\n\n1. Spinal bleeding context:\n- If truly common in natural deaths, this supports the possibility of non-intentional causes\n- Medical literature suggests some natural conditions can cause spinal hemorrhaging\n- Without specific details, the claim of being \"common\" requires cautious evaluation\n\n2. Rib dislocation considerations:\n- Post-mortem changes and resuscitation attempts can indeed cause physical trauma\n- Aggressive CPR can potentially cause rib fractures or dislocations\n- Medical professionals acknowledge these can occur during emergency intervention\n\n3. Additional context:\n- No independent corroborating evidence definitively proves intentional harm\n- Two infant deaths statistically rare but not impossible through natural causes\n- SIDS frequency is low but does occur\n\n4. Potential alternative explanations:\n- Resuscitation attempts could account for some observed physical changes\n- Natural medical conditions might explain some findings\n- No direct evidence of deliberate harm conclusively established\n\n5. Probabilistic reasoning:\n- If spinal bleeding and rib dislocation are genuinely common/explainable through natural processes or medical intervention, the likelihood of these findings being consistent with non-guilt increases\n\nGiven the nuanced medical explanation and lack of definitive proof of intentional harm, the probability seems reasonably high.\n\nProbability: 75",
