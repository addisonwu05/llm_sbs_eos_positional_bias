  "To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts, I'll analyze the key details:\n\n1. Initial post-mortem suggested natural causes\n2. Injuries found later included:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in the lung\n\nConsiderations:\n- Resuscitation can cause some physical trauma, especially in infants\n- Chest compressions can cause rib and soft tissue bruising\n- Mouth-to-mouth/intubation could potentially cause frenulum tear\n- Lung trauma can occur during aggressive resuscitation\n\nHowever, the breadth and specificity of injuries raise some concerns:\n- Multiple bruises to arms and legs seem extensive for standard resuscitation\n- Torn frenulum is less typical\n- Blood in the lung requires careful evaluation\n\nWhile some injuries could be explained by resuscitation, the totality suggests a higher likelihood of deliberate injury than pure medical intervention.\n\nGiven the nuanced evidence and potential alternative explanations, I would assess the probability of these injuries being solely from resuscitation as:\n\n40",
  "Analyzing the injuries from the perspective of potential intentional harm:\n\n1. Multiple bruises on arms and legs:\n- Consistent with forceful physical handling\n- Potential signs of shaking or squeezing\n- Typical pattern in non-accidental infant injury\n\n2. Torn frenulum:\n- Suggests forceful action around mouth/face\n- Often indicates deliberate trauma\n- Not easily explained by accidental interaction\n\n3. Blood in the lung:\n- Could indicate internal trauma\n- Suggests significant physical force\n- Potentially from smothering or aggressive compression\n\n4. Contextual factors:\n- Second child (Ben) also died under similar circumstances\n- No clear medical explanation for first death\n- Injuries discovered after detailed re-examination\n\n5. Forensic interpretation:\n- Pattern of injuries more suggestive of deliberate harm\n- Multiple locations and types of trauma\n- Unlikely to be purely accidental\n\nConsidering the comprehensive evidence and pattern of injuries across both children, the probability of Jane being responsible for intentional harm to Andy is:\n\n90",
  "Analyzing the absence of petechiae in Ben's case:\n\n1.

Alternative explanations:\n- Natural medical condition\n- Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\n- Quick/controlled oxygen deprivation method\n\n5. Forensic assessment:\n- Lack of petechiae is statistically somewhat unusual\n- But not conclusive evidence of non-guilt\n- Requires additional contextual interpretation\n\nConsidering the nuanced forensic and medical factors, the probability that the absence of petechiae indicates non-guilt is:\n\n60",
  "Analyzing the absence of petechiae from a guilt perspective:\n\n1.

Contextual factors:\n- Repeated infant death scenario\n- Previous experience might refine technique\n- Potential deliberate avoidance of obvious injury markers\n\n5. Forensic assessment:\n- Absence of petechiae suspicious but not definitive\n- Consistent with potential intentional, careful smothering\n- Part of a larger pattern of suspicious infant deaths\n\nConsidering the complex forensic and medical factors, the probability that the absence of petechiae indicates potential guilt is:\n\n75",
