Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Ben showed evidence of significant trauma:\n- Rib and spinal cord injuries\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n- Hemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n\n2. Petechiae are typically associated with smothering, but their absence doesn't definitively prove or disprove smothering.\n\n3. The injuries suggest significant physical trauma that isn't typical of a natural death or SIDS.\n\n4. While SIDS occurs in 1/4,000 cases, having two infant deaths in the same family is extremely rare.\n\n5. The subsequent investigation of Andy's first death revealed additional hidden injuries.\n\nThese factors suggest that the absence of petechiae, while potentially unusual, doesn't strongly indicate Jane's innocence given the other significant injuries found.\n\nHowever, without definitive medical expert testimony about the specific significance of petechiae's absence, I can only provide a moderate probability assessment.\n\nThe absence of petechiae, if Jane is truly not guilty, would have a relatively low probability of occurring given the other traumatic findings.\n\nProbability: 25"

Petechiae are classic signs of mechanical asphyxiation/smothering, but they do not always appear in every case.\n\n2. Medical literature shows that petechiae can be inconsistently present in suffocation/smothering cases:\n- Not all smothering incidents produce petechiae\n- Technique of smothering can influence presence/absence of these markers\n- Individual physiological variations affect petechiae formation\n\n3. Ben showed other significant trauma consistent with potential non-accidental injury:\n- Rib and spinal cord injuries\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n- Hemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n\n4. The absence of petechiae does not rule out smothering, especially given the other forensic evidence suggesting deliberate harm.\n\n5.
