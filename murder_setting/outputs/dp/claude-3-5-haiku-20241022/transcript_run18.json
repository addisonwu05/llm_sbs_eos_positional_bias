Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

These injuries suggest non-accidental trauma. While petechiae are typically associated with smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out smothering or intentional harm.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery of suspicious injuries in Andy's case upon re-examination, coupled with Ben's extensive injuries, raises serious concerns about potential intentional harm.\n\nThe SIDS statistics (1 in 4,000) become extremely improbable when considering two successive infant deaths in the same family, especially with Ben's documented injuries.\n\nThe absence of petechiae alone is not strong enough evidence to suggest Jane's innocence, given the other substantial forensic findings.\n\nWhile the absence of petechiae might create some reasonable doubt, the overall medical evidence strongly suggests intentional harm.\n\nConsidering the comprehensive medical evidence, the probability that Jane is not guilty based on the absence of petechiae is relatively low.\n\n75"

Medical literature indicates petechiae are present in approximately 70-80% of smothering cases, meaning 20-30% might lack these specific markers\n5. The absence of petechiae does not negate other strong evidence of intentional harm\n6. The specific method of smothering can influence injury presentation\n7.
