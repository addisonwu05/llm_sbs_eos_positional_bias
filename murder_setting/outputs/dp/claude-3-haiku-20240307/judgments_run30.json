  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and not due to any wrongdoing by Jane. The background information provided suggests that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a plausible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben, and the medical findings in Ben's case are consistent with natural causes or post-mortem injuries.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high, as these injuries could be consistent with smothering or other forms of physical abuse. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, these medical findings would be more likely to be the result of her actions rather than natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is highly likely. The background information suggests that SIDS is a plausible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben, and the medical findings in Ben's case are consistent with natural causes or post-mortem injuries. In a scenario where Jane is not the perpetrator, the lack of these specific injuries would be expected.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is less likely. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, the lack of these specific injuries would be unexpected, as they are commonly associated with deaths due to smothering or other forms of asphyxiation. The absence of these injuries would raise questions about the cause of death and the reliability of the evidence against Jane.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are highly likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts made to revive him. This is supported by the information provided, which states that these types of injuries are common in cases of attempted resuscitation, especially for babies. In a scenario where Jane is not the perpetrator, these injuries would be expected and consistent with natural causes or medical intervention.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is lower. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, the injuries could potentially be the result of her actions rather than solely from medical intervention. The presence of these injuries, without clear evidence of their origin, would raise more suspicion about Jane's involvement in Andy's death.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The background information suggests that the injuries, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were likely a result of natural causes or post-mortem changes, rather than any wrongdoing by Jane. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries when Ben was initially brought in supports the idea that they were not present at that time.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is lower. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, the injuries could have been inflicted by her and may not have been visible or noted by the nurses initially. The absence of these injuries at the time of hospital admission would raise more questions about the timeline and circumstances surrounding Ben's death, and could potentially be seen as an attempt to cover up Jane's involvement.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, are highly likely. In a scenario where SIDS is the plausible explanation for the deaths, it is not uncommon for these types of similarities to exist between cases, as SIDS can occur in a seemingly random and unexplainable manner. The background information provided suggests that SIDS is a common occurrence, and the similarities observed would be expected if Jane is not the perpetrator.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is lower. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, the similarities may be more indicative of a pattern of behavior or a deliberate attempt to conceal her actions, rather than a natural occurrence. The striking resemblance between the two incidents would raise more suspicion about Jane's involvement and the possibility of premeditation or a repeated method of harming her children.\n\n50",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case being indicative of abuse or smothering is relatively low. The background information suggests that these types of injuries can also be consistent with resuscitation attempts, especially for a baby. In a scenario where Jane is not the perpetrator, these findings would be more likely to be the result of medical intervention rather than any abusive actions.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case being indicative of abuse or smothering is high. These types of injuries are characteristic of smothering and would be more consistent with a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, rather than the result of resuscitation attempts alone. The presence of these findings would strongly support the case against Jane and the likelihood of her involvement in Andy's death.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is relatively low. The background information suggests that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a plausible explanation for Ben's death, and these types of injuries can also be associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts. In a scenario where Jane is not the perpetrator, these findings would be more likely to be indicative of natural causes or medical intervention rather than intentional harm.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is high. These types of injuries are commonly associated with asphyxiation or physical abuse, and would be more likely to be the result of intentional harm in a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator. The presence of these specific findings would strongly support the case against Jane and the likelihood of her involvement in Ben's death.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is low. In a scenario where SIDS is the plausible explanation, the hypoxic damage could have occurred gradually or over a longer period of time, rather than just a few hours before. The background information suggests that the causes of SIDS are not well-understood, and the timeline of the medical findings may not necessarily point to intentional harm by Jane.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is high. In a scenario where Jane is the perpetrator, the timeline of the medical findings, specifically the hypoxic damage occurring just hours before Ben's death, would be more consistent with intentional harm or smothering, rather than a gradual or natural process. The doctor's assertion about the timing of the hypoxic damage would lend more support to the case against Jane if she is indeed guilty.\n\n80",

  "Based on the evidence presented and the probability assessment, I believe the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
