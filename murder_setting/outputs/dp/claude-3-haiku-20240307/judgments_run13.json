  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be consistent with SIDS or the resuscitation attempts, and less likely to be due to smothering. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which is a relatively low probability. Additionally, the injuries to Andy's body could be explained by the resuscitation attempts, as such injuries are common in such situations. \n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is 80%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are very likely to be consistent with smothering, and not with SIDS or resuscitation attempts. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are all indicative of physical trauma, which would be highly unlikely in a case of SIDS. Additionally, the subsequent discovery of similar injuries in the younger son, Ben, further strengthens the case that the injuries were caused by Jane's actions.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is 95%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not notice or document these injuries suggests that they were either not visible at the time or developed later. This could be consistent with a case of SIDS, where the cause of death is sudden and unexplained.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 90%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is very unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The presence of injuries such as rib and spinal cord injuries, as well as hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, suggest that these were the result of intentional harm rather than natural causes. The fact that the nurses did not notice or document these injuries does not mean they were not present, as they may have been overlooked or not immediately visible.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 20%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm. The information provided indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred during the resuscitation efforts or post-mortem.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is 90%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is low. The information provided indicates that these injuries are commonly associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm. If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it would be less likely for these specific injuries to be present, as they do not align with the mechanism of death by smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is 30%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is highly likely. The lack of these injuries would be consistent with a natural or unexplained cause of death, such as SIDS, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is 90%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is unlikely. Smothering typically leads to certain characteristic injuries, including petechiae, that would be expected to be present if Jane had intentionally smothered Ben. The lack of these injuries casts doubt on the likelihood of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is 30%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a condition where the cause of death is unexplained, and hypoxic brain damage can occur in such cases, often shortly before the infant's death. This would be consistent with a natural, unexplained cause of death rather than intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is 90%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. In cases of intentional smothering, the hypoxic damage would likely have occurred over a longer period, leading to the infant's death, rather than in just a few hours. The doctor's allegation that the damage was caused shortly before death is more consistent with a sudden, unexpected event like SIDS rather than a deliberate act.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is 40%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is lower. These injuries are more consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would contradict the possibility of a natural, unexplained cause of death like SIDS. The presence of these specific injuries casts doubt on the likelihood of Jane's innocence.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is 40%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high. These specific injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would be the expected result if Jane had intentionally harmed her son. The medical evidence strongly supports the conclusion that Jane is guilty of causing these injuries leading to Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is 90%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low. These injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, which would contradict the initial finding of natural causes in Andy's death. If Jane is truly not guilty, these types of injuries would be unexpected and less likely to be present.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is 30%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is very high. These injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, which would be consistent with Jane intentionally harming her son. The re-examination of Andy's death uncovering these types of injuries strongly supports the conclusion that Jane is guilty of causing her son's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is 90%.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is moderate. While the shared characteristics, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, could potentially be coincidental, they do raise some suspicion. However, in the case of SIDS, it is not uncommon for multiple unexplained infant deaths to occur within the same family. Therefore, if Jane is truly not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents, while notable, are not overwhelmingly unlikely.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is 60%.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is very high. The shared characteristics, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, are highly suggestive of a pattern of intentional harm. The fact that these details are so closely aligned in both cases strongly indicates that Jane's actions were the cause of the deaths, rather than natural or accidental causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is 90%.",
  "Based on the evidence provided in the case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is 80%.\n\nThis assessment is based on the following factors:\n\n1. The presence of injuries in Ben, such as the hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma.\n2. The similarities between the two incidents, including the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, which raise suspicion of a pattern of intentional harm.\n3. The re-examination of Andy's death, which uncovered injuries indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.\n4. The lack of typical SIDS-related injuries, such as the absence of petechiae, which casts doubt on the possibility of natural, unexplained causes.\n\nWhile some of the evidence, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben, could be explained by natural causes or resuscitation attempts, the overall weight of the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is 80%.",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
