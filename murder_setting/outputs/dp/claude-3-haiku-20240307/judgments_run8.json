  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high. The nurses who examined Ben at the hospital did not note any injuries, which suggests that the injuries were either not present or not visible at that time.\n\nGiven the information provided, the sudden and unexplained nature of the deaths, and the possibility of SIDS, it is plausible that the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy were not present when he was first brought to the hospital.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nGiven the evidence of injuries found on Ben during the autopsy, such as bruises, hemorrhages, and hypoxic damage, it is less likely that these injuries were not present when Ben was first brought to the hospital. The medical professionals who examined Ben at the hospital may have missed or overlooked these injuries, but the presence of such significant injuries suggests they were likely present at the time of admission.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 25%.\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were common findings in natural death or occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, then the likelihood of these injuries being present is quite high.\n\nGiven this new information, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is NOT GUILTY is 85%.\n\n85%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were common findings in natural death or occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, then the likelihood of these injuries being present is still relatively high, but lower than if Jane is NOT GUILTY.\n\nGiven the new information, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben if Jane is GUILTY is 70%.\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts and are consistent with attempts to revive a baby, then the likelihood of these injuries being present is very high.\n\nGiven this additional information, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is 95%.\n\n95%",
