  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural causes or medical interventions, and not due to any intentional harm.\n\nThe information provided indicates that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a plausible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is a well-documented phenomenon, and the risk factors associated with it, such as the higher incidence among boys, align with the details of this case.\n\nAdditionally, the autopsy findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are not necessarily indicative of foul play. Spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or medical interventions is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to intentional harm is high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the autopsy findings of injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, along with other evidence, led to Jane being charged with the murder of both of her children. If Jane is indeed guilty, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are likely the result of her intentional actions, rather than natural causes or medical interventions.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the charges against Jane, if she is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to her actions is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note any injuries when Ben was brought in suggests that the injuries, including the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, likely occurred after he was transported to the hospital. This could indicate that these injuries were not caused by Jane, but rather happened later, possibly during resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions.\n\nGiven the lack of observed injuries by the hospital staff and the plausibility of SIDS as an explanation for the deaths, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her son Ben, it is reasonable to assume that the injuries found during the autopsy, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were likely present when Ben was initially brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not observe these injuries suggests they may have been overlooked or not yet fully developed at the time.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the evidence of intentional harm, if she is indeed guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben is highly likely.\n\nThe lack of additional injuries commonly associated with smothering, beyond the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, suggests that the cause of Ben's death may not have been intentional suffocation. Petechiae, for example, are a common sign of asphyxiation, and their absence casts doubt on the theory that Jane smothered her son.\n\nGiven the plausibility of SIDS as an explanation for the deaths, and the absence of other typical smothering injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is less likely.\n\nIf Jane is indeed guilty of intentionally smothering her son Ben, the lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, would be unexpected. Petechiae are commonly found in cases of asphyxiation or suffocation, and their absence could suggest that the method of harm used by Jane was not a straightforward smothering.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the specific circumstances or method employed by Jane did not result in the typical signs of smothering, or that the injuries were not properly documented or identified during the investigation.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the expectation of finding common smothering injuries, if she is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with the resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes of death, and the injuries found were initially attributed to the resuscitation efforts. This suggests that the injuries, such as the bruises and torn frenulum, were likely the result of the medical interventions performed in an attempt to revive him, rather than any intentional harm.\n\nGiven the plausibility of SIDS as the cause of Andy's death and the initial assessment that the injuries were consistent with resuscitation, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were the result of the resuscitation attempts is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were the result of resuscitation attempts is lower.\n\nIf Jane is indeed guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her son Andy, the injuries found, such as the bruises and torn frenulum, may not be easily explained by the resuscitation efforts alone. The presence of these injuries, along with the subsequent findings from the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs, could suggest that Jane was responsible for the harm inflicted on her son.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the additional evidence found during the investigation, if she is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were the result of resuscitation attempts is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are highly likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates several striking similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, such as their ages, the time of day, and the fact that Jane was alone with them when they were found unconscious. These coincidences, if Jane is not guilty, would be consistent with the plausibility of SIDS as the explanation for the deaths.\n\nSIDS is a well-documented phenomenon that can occur in seemingly healthy infants, and the risk factors associated with it, such as age and gender, align with the details of this case. Given the lack of clear evidence of intentional harm and the possibility of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are less likely.\n\nIf Jane is indeed guilty of intentionally harming or smothering both of her children, the striking similarities between the two incidents would be more suspicious and less likely to be coincidental. The fact that both babies were a similar age, died at a similar time of day, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them could suggest a pattern of intentional behavior, rather than just a tragic series of natural or accidental deaths.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the context of the case, if she is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is moderate.\n\nWhile these types of injuries can be indicative of smothering or other violent trauma, they can also occur in natural or accidental infant deaths, such as those associated with SIDS. The information provided suggests that the cause of death for both Andy and Ben is not entirely clear, and SIDS remains a plausible explanation.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the lack of definitive evidence of intentional harm, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages found in Ben were due to natural causes or accidental circumstances is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these types of injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which aligns with the charges against Jane. If she is indeed guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her son Ben, the presence of these specific injuries would be expected and likely.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the charges against Jane, if she is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages found in Ben were the result of her actions is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is low.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs are characteristic of abuse and smothering. If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these injuries would be unexpected and unlikely to be the result of natural causes or accidental circumstances.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the plausibility of SIDS as the explanation for the deaths, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy were present is:\n\n20%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is moderate.\n\nWhile the doctor's assertion suggests a timeline for the injuries, the information provided does not conclusively rule out other possible explanations. If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could have been the result of natural causes or events that occurred closer to Ben's death, such as during the resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the plausibility of SIDS as a potential explanation for Ben's death, and the lack of definitive evidence of intentional harm, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is high.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before Ben's death aligns with the charges against Jane. If she is indeed guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her son, the timeline of the injuries would be consistent with her actions being the cause of the hypoxic damage.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the charges against Jane, if she is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is:\n\n80%",
  "Based on the evidence and analysis presented in the given case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n60%",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
