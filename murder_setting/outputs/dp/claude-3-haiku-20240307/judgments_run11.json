  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being a result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts is quite high. The case summary indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely caused by the resuscitation efforts, rather than any intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being a result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts is low. The case summary indicates that the autopsy found injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, which are more indicative of intentional harm rather than natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, if Jane is guilty, is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high. The case summary indicates that the injuries, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were only discovered during the autopsy, and were not noted by the hospital staff when Ben was brought in. This suggests that the injuries may have occurred after the resuscitation efforts or during the transport to the hospital.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is low. The case summary indicates that the autopsy found clear evidence of injuries, such as spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which were not noted by the hospital staff. This suggests that the injuries were likely inflicted by Jane before Ben was brought to the hospital, and were intentionally concealed from the medical professionals.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is guilty, is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is likely. The case summary indicates that while there were injuries found, such as spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, the typical signs of smothering (petechiae) were not present. This suggests that the cause of death may not have been due to smothering, and the other injuries could have resulted from natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is less likely. The case summary indicates that the autopsy found clear evidence of injuries, such as spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which suggest intentional harm. The lack of petechiae, which are commonly found in cases of smothering, raises the possibility that Jane may have used a method of suffocation that did not leave these typical marks.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high. The case summary indicates that the initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death, and the injuries found, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, were later attributed to the resuscitation efforts made to revive him. This is a plausible explanation if Jane is not guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is lower. The case summary indicates that additional tests were later conducted on Andy's autopsy photographs, which revealed further injuries such as bruises and a torn frenulum. This suggests that the initial assessment of the injuries being due to resuscitation may have been inaccurate, and the injuries could have been caused by intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is guilty, is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is moderately likely. The case summary indicates that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage must have occurred shortly before Ben's death. However, without additional details on the autopsy findings and the timeline of events, it is difficult to determine with certainty the exact timing of the brain damage.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is higher. The case summary indicates that the doctor specifically alleged the brain damage must have occurred shortly before Ben's death, which suggests the damage was inflicted intentionally by Jane in the hours leading up to the infant's death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is guilty, is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is quite high. The case summary states that both babies were around the same age, died at similar times of the day after being fed, and were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities could be explained by natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is more common in young infants and can occur suddenly without clear explanation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these similarities between both incidents would exist if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is moderately high, but lower than if she were not guilty. The case summary indicates that the similarities, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane's presence, are quite striking. However, if Jane is guilty, these similarities could also suggest a pattern of intentional harm rather than just coincidence.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these similarities between both incidents would exist if Jane is guilty is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is relatively low. The case summary states that these injuries are consistent with smothering, but if Jane is not guilty, there are other possible explanations, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or accidental causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be found if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is quite high. The case summary clearly states that these injuries are indicative of smothering or other violent trauma, which would be consistent with Jane intentionally harming her son.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be found if Jane is guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low. The case summary states that these injuries were only found upon further examination of Andy's autopsy photographs, after the initial post-mortem had attributed his death to natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be found if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n30%",
