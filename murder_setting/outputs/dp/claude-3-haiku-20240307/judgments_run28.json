  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case is quite high.\n\nThe spinal bleeding is a common finding in cases of natural infant deaths, as mentioned in the background information. The dislocated ribs could have occurred during the resuscitation attempts or post-mortem, and are not necessarily indicative of foul play.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben's case, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the likelihood of finding spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case is much lower.\n\nThe background information suggests that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are more commonly associated with natural causes of death, such as SIDS, rather than intentional harm.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben's case is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the injuries found in Andy were due to the resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of these injuries being consistent with attempts to revive a baby is quite high.\n\nThe background information states that the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are commonly associated with resuscitation efforts, especially for infants.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is much lower.\n\nThe background information suggests that the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, are more likely to be associated with intentional harm rather than attempts to revive the baby.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high.\n\nThe background information states that the injuries, including rib injuries and hemorrhages, were only discovered during the autopsy. This suggests that these injuries may have occurred after Ben was transported to the hospital, potentially during resuscitation efforts or post-mortem examinations.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is much lower.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her son Ben, it is more likely that the injuries, such as the rib injuries and hemorrhages, were already present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that they were not noted by the nurses at that time could suggest an attempt to conceal the injuries.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is quite likely.\n\nThe background information states that no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, besides the rib injuries and hemorrhages. This suggests that the cause of Ben's death may have been due to natural causes, such as SIDS, rather than intentional suffocation.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is less likely.\n\nPetechiae are a common indicator of death by smothering or suffocation, as they are caused by the rupture of small blood vessels due to the lack of oxygen. The absence of such injuries in Ben's case, despite the other findings, would be unusual if Jane had intentionally smothered her son.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is relatively low.\n\nThe background information states that these injuries are commonly associated with smothering or other forms of intentional harm. However, if Jane is not guilty and the cause of death was natural, such as SIDS, then these injuries would not be expected.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is quite high.\n\nThe background information states that these injuries are commonly associated with smothering or other forms of intentional harm. If Jane is guilty of smothering her son Ben, then these injuries would be expected and consistent with the cause of death.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages being consistent with smothering or violent trauma is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low.\n\nThe background information states that these injuries can also be consistent with resuscitation attempts, especially for infants. If Jane is not guilty and the cause of Andy's death was natural, such as SIDS, then these injuries would not be expected to be the result of intentional harm.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being indicative of abuse and smothering in Andy's case is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is quite high.\n\nThe background information states that these injuries are commonly associated with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than resuscitation attempts or natural causes. If Jane is guilty of smothering her son Andy, then these injuries would be expected and consistent with the cause of death.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being indicative of abuse and smothering in Andy's case is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between the incidents involving her two children is relatively high.\n\nThe background information states that both babies were around the same age, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities are not necessarily indicative of foul play, and could be reasonably explained by natural causes, such as SIDS, which is more common in young infants.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of there being these similarities between the two incidents is:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between the incidents involving her two children is quite high.\n\nThe background information suggests that the similarities, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are unlikely to occur by chance, especially with two separate incidents.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her children, these similarities would be expected, as she may have used a similar modus operandi in both cases.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability of there being these similarities between the two incidents is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nThe background information does not provide a clear explanation for the cause of the hypoxic damage, and if the deaths were due to natural causes such as SIDS, this type of injury may not have necessarily occurred just hours before death.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence linking Jane to the cause of the hypoxic damage, if she is not guilty, the probability that it was caused a matter of hours before Ben's death is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is quite high.\n\nThe background information states that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage must have been caused just hours before Ben's death. If Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her son, this timeline would be consistent with an act of smothering or other deliberate actions that led to the lack of oxygen and resulting brain damage.\n\nGiven this, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is:\n\n80%",
  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis of the various probabilities, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the analysis of the probabilities, the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
