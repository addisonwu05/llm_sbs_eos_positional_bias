  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls. The fact that the nurses did not note any injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital suggests that the injuries were likely not present at that time.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The autopsy revealed significant injuries to Ben, including bruises, hemorrhages, and hypoxic damage, which suggest inflicted harm rather than natural causes. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries at the time likely indicates that Jane was able to conceal or minimize the visible signs of harm before bringing Ben to the hospital.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts, as the post-mortem had initially suggested natural causes of death. The injuries observed, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, are common when performing CPR and other life-saving measures on a baby. Therefore, in this scenario, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be a result of the medical interventions rather than any foul play.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be a result of foul play rather than the resuscitation attempts. The fact that the initial autopsy attributed the injuries to natural causes suggests an attempt to conceal any evidence of harm. However, the subsequent re-examination of the evidence and the finding of additional injuries, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, indicate that these injuries were likely inflicted and not solely due to the medical interventions. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be indicative of intentional harm.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is highly likely. Petechiae are a common sign of smothering, but their absence does not necessarily mean that smothering did not occur. There can be a variety of reasons why petechiae may not be present, even in a case of smothering. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is a relatively likely scenario.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is less likely. Petechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering, as they result from the increased pressure in the veins and capillaries during the asphyxiation process. The absence of such injuries, despite the other findings of harm to Ben, suggests that the cause of death may not have been smothering or that the smothering was carried out in a way that did not produce the typical petechial hemorrhages. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is relatively unlikely.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and not indicative of foul play. The information provided suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or during the resuscitation efforts. Given the absence of other clear signs of intentional harm, the presence of these injuries is consistent with a natural or accidental death scenario, if Jane is not guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively low. The presence of other injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, suggests a more severe pattern of harm that is not easily explained by natural causes or medical interventions alone. In a scenario where Jane is guilty, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are more likely to be part of the overall injuries inflicted on Ben, rather than resulting from benign factors.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The medical evidence suggesting a close temporal relationship between the brain injury and death is consistent with a natural or accidental scenario, where an acute event led to the oxygen deprivation and subsequent death. In a case where Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage being caused just prior to death is a plausible and likely explanation.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The doctor's assessment that the brain injury was recent suggests a deliberate and proximate act of harm, rather than a natural or accidental event. In a scenario where Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage was more likely the result of a intentional act of smothering or asphyxiation that directly led to Ben's death, rather than being caused by events hours earlier.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy is unlikely. These injuries are characteristic of smothering and indicative of abuse, which contradicts the initial assessment of natural causes of death. In a scenario where Jane is not guilty, these findings would be unexpected and inconsistent with the understanding that Andy's death was due to natural causes. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present in Andy is low.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy are highly likely. These injuries are characteristic of smothering and indicative of abuse, which suggests intentional harm rather than natural causes. Given the additional evidence of harm found in the re-examination of Andy's case, if Jane is indeed guilty, the presence of these specific injuries in Andy is very likely.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would contradict the scenario where Jane is not guilty of the murders. In the absence of clear evidence of intentional harm, the presence of these specific injuries that are indicative of smothering or violent trauma is unlikely if Jane is truly not guilty.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely. These injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would be indicative of intentional harm. Given the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty of the murders, the presence of these specific injuries that point to smothering or violent trauma is very likely.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is relatively high. The fact that both babies were around the same age, died at similar times of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them could simply be a coincidence or reflect common patterns in sudden infant deaths, rather than indicative of intentional harm. In a scenario where Jane is not guilty, these similarities are more likely to be the result of natural causes or chance circumstances rather than evidence of a pattern of abuse.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is very high. The striking parallels in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of both of Jane's children, including the ages, timing, and Jane's presence, suggest a pattern of behavior that is highly unlikely to be coincidental. In a scenario where Jane is guilty, these similarities are much more likely to be indicative of a repeated modus operandi rather than simply chance occurrences.\n\n90",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, including the injuries found on the children, the suspicious similarities between the two incidents, and the contradictory probabilities for different scenarios, I believe the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70",
  "Based on the overall evidence and probabilities presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
