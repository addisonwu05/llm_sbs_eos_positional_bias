  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy's autopsy are likely to be consistent with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or the resuscitation attempts, rather than being the result of smothering. The case details indicate that the initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes of death, and the injuries found were later attributed to the resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with a case of SIDS or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional smothering, is relatively high.\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy's autopsy are likely to be consistent with smothering or other forms of intentional harm, rather than being the result of SIDS or resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe case details indicate that the injuries found in Andy's autopsy, including bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are more consistent with physical abuse or smothering than natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the additional findings from the second autopsy of Ben, which revealed injuries to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being the result of intentional harm is relatively high.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are likely to be consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm.\n\nThe new information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were probably caused by post-mortem changes or the resuscitation efforts, rather than being a result of intentional physical abuse.\n\nGiven these details, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's autopsy, if Jane is not guilty, is relatively high.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's autopsy is lower, as these injuries are more likely to be the result of intentional harm rather than natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the new information that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs were probably caused by post-mortem changes or resuscitation efforts, the presence of these injuries in Ben's autopsy would be less consistent with Jane being guilty of intentionally harming her child.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy is likely.\n\nThe absence of these characteristic smothering injuries, in conjunction with the information that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found were more consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, suggests that Ben's death was not the result of intentional suffocation or smothering.\n\nGiven the provided details, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae and other smothering-related injuries in Ben's autopsy, if Jane is not guilty, is relatively high.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy is less likely.\n\nThe presence of injuries like spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which can be consistent with smothering, coupled with the absence of characteristic smothering injuries like petechiae, would be unusual if Jane had intentionally harmed her child.\n\nGiven the case details, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae and other smothering-related injuries in Ben's autopsy, if Jane is guilty, is relatively low.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note the injuries, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, at the time Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that these injuries likely occurred later, potentially during the resuscitation efforts or post-mortem.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n90",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is lower.\n\nThe information that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage must have been caused just hours before death suggests a more acute and sudden event, which would be less consistent with natural causes or accidental death.
