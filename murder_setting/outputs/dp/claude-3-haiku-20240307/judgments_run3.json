  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is quite likely.\n\nSIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, and it is often characterized by the lack of obvious signs of trauma or injury. While some deaths due to smothering may present with petechiae, their absence does not necessarily rule out SIDS as the cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben's case, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is:\n\n85%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to smothering, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is less likely.\n\nPetechiae are a common sign of smothering, as they are caused by the rupture of small blood vessels due to the pressure applied to the neck or face. While the absence of petechiae does not definitively rule out smothering, it is generally considered less common in cases of intentional suffocation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben's case, if Jane is guilty and the deaths were due to smothering, is:\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case is quite likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely caused by post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, rather than being a result of smothering.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood of the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to natural causes, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to smothering, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case is less likely.\n\nThe information provided suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely caused by post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, rather than being a result of smothering.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood of the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case, if Jane is guilty and the deaths were due to smothering, is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of Andy was due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the injuries found in Andy are quite likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries found in Andy, including bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are consistent with the typical injuries that can occur during attempts to revive a baby, especially through CPR and other resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the death of Andy was due to smothering, the injuries found in Andy are less likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries found in Andy, including bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, could be indicative of physical abuse or intentional harm, rather than just being the result of resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, if Jane is guilty and the death was due to smothering, is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of Ben was due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it is very likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries, including the ribs and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were not noted by the nurses when Ben was first brought to the hospital. This suggests that these injuries may have developed or become more apparent after the initial assessment.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the death of Ben was due to smothering, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries, including the ribs and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were not noted by the nurses when Ben was first brought to the hospital. This suggests that these injuries may have developed or become more apparent after the initial assessment.\n\nHowever, if Jane is guilty and the death was due to smothering, it is more likely that the injuries were present but overlooked or not properly documented by the medical staff at the time of the initial assessment.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is guilty and the death was due to smothering, is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the similarities between both incidents are quite likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that there are several striking similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies, the time of day when they died, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\nGiven the nature of SIDS, which is a sudden and unexplained death that can occur in seemingly healthy infants, the presence of these similarities between the two incidents is not unexpected and is in fact quite common in cases of natural infant deaths.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to natural causes is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to intentional smothering, the similarities between both incidents are also quite likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that there are several striking similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies, the time of day when they died, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, these similarities could suggest a pattern of behavior or modus operandi in the way she allegedly committed the crimes. The repetition of the circumstances and timing of the deaths may indicate a deliberate and calculated approach to the murders.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents if Jane is guilty and the deaths were due to intentional smothering is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of Ben was due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the presence of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is less likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these types of injuries are more consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, rather than natural causes. In cases of SIDS, these specific injuries are not typically observed.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the death of Ben was due to smothering, the presence of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is quite likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these types of injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would be the case if Jane is guilty of intentionally causing Ben's death.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present if Jane is guilty and the death was due to smothering is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of Ben was due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it is less likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death.\n\nIn SIDS cases, the underlying cause of death is often not clear, and the hypoxic damage to the brain may have developed over a longer period of time, rather than just a few hours before the death occurred.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes, is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is guilty and the death of Ben was due to smothering, it is more likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before his death. This timeline is more consistent with a scenario where Jane intentionally caused harm to Ben, leading to the hypoxic brain damage shortly before his death, rather than a natural SIDS-related event.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is guilty and the death was due to smothering, is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of Andy was due to natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the presence of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung is less likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these types of injuries are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of abuse, rather than typical findings in a natural SIDS-related death. While some minor injuries can occur during resuscitation efforts, the specific pattern of injuries described is more suggestive of intentional harm.\n\nGiven this context, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung being present in Andy's case, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes, is:\n\n30%",
