  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is relatively likely.\n\nSIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is made when no other cause of death can be identified. The pathophysiology of SIDS is not fully understood, and the mechanism of death is often sudden and unpredictable. In some cases of SIDS, there may be limited or no visible external signs of trauma or asphyxiation.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her son Ben, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae would be relatively unlikely.\n\nSmothering typically leads to a lack of oxygen supply, which can result in the development of petechiae (tiny red or purple spots) on the skin, conjunctiva, and other areas. The presence of petechiae is considered a characteristic sign of death by asphyxiation or smothering.\n\nHowever, it is possible that in some cases of smothering, petechiae may not be present. This can occur if the smothering was brief, or if other factors, such as the position of the body or the method used, prevented the development of petechiae.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n50%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is:\n\n20%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma is:\n\n40%",

  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is:\n\n90%",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%",
