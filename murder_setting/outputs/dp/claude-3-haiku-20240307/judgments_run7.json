  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the absence of typical injuries like petechiae in the case of Ben is highly likely.\n\nSIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, and it does not typically involve the presence of physical injuries. The injuries found on Ben, such as bruises, torn frenulum, and hemorrhages, could potentially be attributed to the resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions, rather than a result of smothering.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Ben, the absence of injuries such as petechiae is less likely.\n\nPetechiae are small, pinpoint hemorrhages that can occur on the skin, conjunctiva, or mucous membranes due to the rupture of tiny blood vessels during smothering or suffocation. While the absence of petechiae does not completely rule out smothering, their presence is considered a common finding in cases of asphyxiation.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Ben, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae is 25%.\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to SIDS, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe absence of these injuries being noted by the nurses suggests that they may have developed or worsened after the initial hospital visit, potentially due to resuscitation efforts or other medical interventions. It is not uncommon for certain injuries to become more apparent or evident over time, especially in cases of sudden infant death where the cause is unclear.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Ben, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, she would have likely caused the injuries to Ben through the act of smothering. These injuries, such as the rib fractures, spinal cord damage, and hemorrhages, would have been present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, and it would be expected that the medical staff would have noticed and documented them.\n\nThe absence of these injuries being noted by the nurses suggests a possibility that they may have developed or worsened later, which is more plausible if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes or SIDS, it is quite likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were not due to any malicious actions.\n\nThe information provided indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred during the resuscitation attempts or post-mortem. These types of injuries are not necessarily indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse.\n\nGiven the context that these injuries can occur in natural deaths, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Ben, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is higher.\n\nSpinal bleeding and rib injuries can potentially occur during the act of smothering or violent shaking, as the infant's body experiences significant trauma. While the dislocated ribs could also be attributed to resuscitation attempts, the presence of spinal bleeding in conjunction with other suspicious injuries would be more indicative of non-accidental trauma if Jane is guilty.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is 70%.\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes or SIDS, the injuries found in Andy are more likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are commonly seen in cases where resuscitation efforts were made, especially on a vulnerable infant. These types of injuries do not necessarily indicate that smothering or other forms of abuse occurred.\n\nGiven that the initial assessment attributed Andy's injuries to the resuscitation attempts, and that such injuries are consistent with reviving an infant, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Andy, the injuries found in Andy are less likely to be solely due to the resuscitation attempts.\n\nWhile some of the injuries, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts, the presence of additional injuries like the blood in the lung may suggest a more sinister cause. If Jane is guilty, these injuries could potentially be a result of the smothering or other forms of non-accidental trauma, rather than just the attempts to revive the child.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely due to the resuscitation attempts is 40%.\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of her child Ben was due to natural causes or SIDS, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death.\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is characterized by a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, often during sleep. One of the key features of SIDS is the presence of hypoxic (low oxygen) damage to the brain, which can occur in the hours or days leading up to the death.\n\nGiven the information that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before Ben's death, and the fact that this is consistent with the timeline and clinical presentation of SIDS, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered her child Ben, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death.\n\nIn a case of intentional smothering or suffocation, the hypoxic (low oxygen) damage to the brain would likely have occurred much closer to the time of death, as the lack of oxygen would be an immediate and direct result of the asphyxiation.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before death is more consistent with a natural or accidental cause, such as SIDS, where the brain damage can precede the actual death by a longer period of time.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is 40%.\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes or SIDS, the similarities between both incidents are quite likely.\n\nThe information provided indicates that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is more common among young infants, typically occurring within the first year of life. The similarities in the age of the babies, the time of day when they were found unconscious, and the fact that Jane was alone with them at the time, are all consistent with the profile of SIDS.\n\nGiven that SIDS is a sudden and unexplained phenomenon, it is not uncommon for there to be certain parallels between cases, such as the timing and circumstances of the deaths.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she intentionally smothered both of her children, the similarities between the two incidents are less likely to be mere coincidence.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the deaths of both babies occurred under very similar circumstances - same age, same time of day, and Jane being alone with the babies when they were found unconscious. These parallels, combined with the suspicious nature of the injuries found on the second child, Ben, would raise concerns about the possibility of premeditation or a pattern of behavior if Jane is guilty.\n\nThe likelihood of these similarities between both incidents if Jane is guilty is lower, as it would be more expected that a guilty party would try to differentiate the circumstances to avoid detection.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is 50%.\n\n50%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes or SIDS, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided suggests that these injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths were not due to intentional harm, then these specific injuries would be less likely to be present.\n\nWhile some minor injuries could potentially occur during resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions, the combination of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung is more strongly associated with non-accidental trauma.\n\nGiven the context that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific injuries being present in Andy's case is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she intentionally smothered her child Andy, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung is much higher.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these specific injuries are characteristic of smothering and are indicative of abuse. If Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her children, the presence of these types of injuries would be more expected, as they are consistent with the manner of death.\n\nGiven the context that these injuries are strongly associated with non-accidental trauma and smothering, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the death of her child Ben was due to natural causes or SIDS, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these specific injuries, including the hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages, are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma. However, if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes, these types of injuries would not be expected to be present.\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a sudden and unexplained death, and while it can involve some brain damage and other subtle findings, the severe hypoxic injury and hemorrhages described are more indicative of non-accidental trauma.\n\nGiven the context that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty and she intentionally smothered her child Ben, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is much higher.\n\nThe information provided indicates that these specific injuries, including the hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages, are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma.

  "Based on the detailed information provided in the case, and the likelihood assessments for the various pieces of evidence under the scenarios of Jane being guilty or not guilty, my overall assessment is that the probability of Jane being guilty is 70%.\n\n70%",
  "Based on the detailed information and probability assessments provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
