  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in the case of Ben's death is likely. SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, and it does not necessarily involve the presence of such injuries.\n\nThe provided information indicates that the frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls. Given this background, the absence of petechiae in Ben's case, if the deaths were due to SIDS, is a plausible scenario.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty and smothered her children, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case would be less likely.\n\nSmothering, as a method of murder, typically results in the presence of petechiae, which are tiny red or purple spots that can appear on the skin due to the disruption of blood vessels. The lack of such injuries in Ben's case would be unusual if Jane had indeed smothered him.\n\nGiven the evidence of other injuries found on Ben, such as rib fractures, hypoxic brain damage, and eye/eyelid hemorrhages, the absence of petechiae would be an unexpected finding if Jane had used smothering to kill her child.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n20",
  "Given the new information that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were likely due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and not due to smothering, the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty is higher.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which can be common in natural infant deaths, would be a plausible explanation.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben's case would be less likely.\n\nSmothering as a method of murder typically does not result in the type of injuries observed in Ben's case. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are more commonly associated with natural causes of death or injuries sustained during resuscitation attempts.\n\nIf Jane had intentionally smothered Ben, the presence of these specific injuries would be an unexpected finding and would not align with the typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the injuries found in Andy's case are likely.\n\nThe information provided states that the injuries to Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts during the unsuccessful attempt to revive him. Injuries consistent with resuscitation efforts, especially in the case of a baby, are a plausible explanation if the death was due to natural causes.\n\nGiven the background information on SIDS and the frequency of 1 in 4,000 cases in the UK, the presence of these types of injuries in Andy's case is a likely scenario if Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the injuries found in Andy's case are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the injuries found in Andy's case are less likely.\n\nThe information provided states that the injuries to Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts during the unsuccessful attempt to revive him. However, if Jane had intentionally smothered Andy, these types of injuries would not be the expected outcome of such an act.\n\nSmothering as a method of murder typically results in different types of injuries, such as petechiae, rather than the ones observed in Andy's case. The presence of these resuscitation-related injuries would not align with Jane having purposefully smothered her firstborn child.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the injuries found in Andy's case are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe information provided states that the injuries to Ben, such as rib fractures, hypoxic brain damage, and eye/eyelid hemorrhages, were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital. This suggests that these injuries likely developed or became more severe after the initial medical attention, potentially due to the resuscitation attempts or other natural causes.\n\nGiven the background on SIDS and the lack of a clear mechanism or cause, the absence of these injuries at the time of the hospital visit would be a plausible scenario if Jane is not guilty and the death was due to natural causes.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90",

However, if Jane had intentionally smothered her child, these types of injuries would likely have been present and observable at the time of the hospital visit.\n\nSmothering as a method of murder typically results in injuries that would be evident upon the initial medical examination. The absence of these injuries at the time of the hospital visit would not align with a scenario where Jane had purposefully smothered Ben.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the death of her son Ben was due to natural causes like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), it is likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death.\n\nSIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, and it can involve a period of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) before the death occurs. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before Ben's death would be consistent with a SIDS-related scenario, where the infant experiences a period of compromised breathing or oxygen supply leading to the fatal outcome.\n\nGiven the background information on the frequency of SIDS and the lack of a clear mechanism or cause, the presence of hypoxic brain damage a few hours before death would be a plausible finding if Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her son Ben, it is less likely that the hypoxic damage to his brain was caused a matter of hours before his death.\n\nSmothering as a method of murder typically results in a more immediate loss of oxygen, leading to brain damage and death. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused a matter of hours before Ben's death would not align with a scenario where Jane had intentionally smothered her child.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage would be expected to have occurred more abruptly, rather than gradually over a matter of hours. The timeline suggested by the doctor's statement would be inconsistent with a scenario of intentional smothering by Jane.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is lower.\n\nThe information provided states that these injuries are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of her children were due to natural causes like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the presence of these specific injuries would be less expected.\n\nSIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of an infant, and it does not typically involve the types of injuries observed in Ben's case. While SIDS can result in hypoxic damage, the associated haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are more commonly associated with intentional, violent acts.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n30",

If Jane had intentionally smothered Ben, the presence of these types of injuries would be a plausible and expected outcome.\n\nSmothering as a method of murder typically results in hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as these are common indicators of restricted airflow and oxygen deprivation.

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is high.\n\nThe information provided states that both babies, Andy and Ben, were around the same age when they died, they both died at a similar time of day after being fed, and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\nThese similarities are more likely to occur if the deaths were due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), rather than intentional actions. SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death of infants, and it can affect babies of similar ages, often occurring after feeding and during sleep.\n\nGiven the background information on the frequency of SIDS, the presence of these striking similarities between the two incidents would be a plausible scenario if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were not the result of intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that these similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90",

Intentional acts of violence are less likely to result in such consistent patterns, as the circumstances and methods may vary.\n\nThe recurrence of these specific details, such as the age of the babies, the timing of the deaths, and Jane's presence alone with the children, would be more unusual if the deaths were the result of deliberate actions by Jane, rather than natural causes like SIDS.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment that these similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n40",
