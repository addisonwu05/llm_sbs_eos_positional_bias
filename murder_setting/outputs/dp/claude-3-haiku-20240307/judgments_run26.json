  "If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are relatively likely to have occurred.\n\nThe spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have resulted from post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben's case, if the deaths were due to SIDS and Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are less likely to have occurred naturally.\n\nThe spinal bleeding and rib injuries are more indicative of physical trauma, which would be consistent with smothering or other forms of physical abuse, rather than a natural SIDS-related death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben's case, if Jane is guilty of murdering both children, is:\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy were likely not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nSIDS is a natural and unexplained cause of death, and the injuries found on Ben (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) are more indicative of physical trauma, which would not have been present prior to his death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy were likely not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nAs the perpetrator of the crime, Jane would have had the opportunity to inflict the injuries on Ben, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, after he was brought to the hospital and before the autopsy was conducted.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is guilty of murdering both children, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the injuries found on Andy during the autopsy are more likely to be consistent with resuscitation attempts, as initially suggested.\n\nThe bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found on Andy would be expected to occur as a result of the medical interventions carried out to try to revive him, especially given the delicate nature of an infant's body.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Andy were due to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the injuries found on Andy during the autopsy are less likely to be solely the result of resuscitation attempts.\n\nAs the perpetrator of the crimes, Jane would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on Andy, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, before or during the resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Andy were due to factors beyond just resuscitation attempts, if Jane is guilty of murdering both children, is:\n\n70",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively likely.\n\nSIDS is a natural and unexplained cause of death, and the injuries found on Ben (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) are more indicative of physical trauma, which would not necessarily be accompanied by the typical smothering injuries like petechiae.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is less likely.\n\nSmothering typically causes petechiae and other distinctive injuries, which would be expected to be present if Jane had indeed smothered Ben. The absence of these typical smothering injuries casts doubt on the assertion that Jane is guilty of murdering Ben.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is unlikely, if Jane is guilty of murdering both children, is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are less likely to be indicative of abuse or smothering.\n\nThese types of injuries can sometimes occur naturally or as a result of resuscitation efforts, and may not necessarily point to intentional harm if the deaths were truly due to SIDS. Without other clear evidence of foul play, these injuries alone do not conclusively indicate that Jane is guilty.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's case are likely not indicative of abuse if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS is:\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are more likely to be indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\n\nThese types of injuries are consistent with the physical trauma that would be expected from intentionally smothering a child, and their presence supports the assertion that Jane is guilty of murdering Andy.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and smothering if Jane is guilty is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are less likely to be consistent with smothering or other violent trauma.\n\nSIDS is a natural and unexplained cause of death, and while the specific injuries found on Ben's body may be consistent with smothering, they could also potentially occur through other natural mechanisms not related to intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely not due to smothering or violent trauma if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS is:\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are more likely to be consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\n\nThese types of injuries are characteristic of the physical trauma that would be expected from intentionally smothering a child, and their presence supports the assertion that Jane is guilty of murdering Ben.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are indicative of smothering or violent trauma if Jane is guilty is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is less likely.\n\nSIDS is an unexplained and sudden phenomenon, and the brain damage may have occurred over a longer period of time as part of the natural progression of the condition, rather than being caused immediately prior to death. Without clear evidence of intentional harm, the timeline proposed by the doctor is questionable.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was not caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS, is:\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is more likely.\n\nSmothering would result in a sudden and rapid deprivation of oxygen, which could lead to the observed hypoxic brain damage within a short timeframe prior to Ben's death. This timeline would be consistent with Jane intentionally harming Ben immediately before his death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is guilty of murdering both children, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty and the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), then the similarities between the two incidents are relatively likely.\n\nSIDS is known to occur more frequently in young infants, often during or after feedings, and with a higher incidence among baby boys. The similarities in the timing and circumstances of the two deaths could simply be coincidental and not indicative of foul play, especially if the cause was a natural and unexplained phenomenon like SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the similarities between the two incidents are likely if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were due to SIDS is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty and she smothered both of her children, Andy and Ben, then the similarities between the two incidents are more likely to be indicative of a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nThe similarities in the age of the babies, the timing of the deaths, and the circumstances in which Jane found them unconscious when she was alone with them, would be highly unusual to occur by chance if the deaths were not related. These parallels strongly suggest a premeditated and deliberate course of action by Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the similarities between the two incidents are likely if Jane is guilty of murdering both children is:\n\n90",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, which includes the presence of injuries indicative of abuse, the similarities between the two incidents, and the lack of conclusive evidence supporting a SIDS diagnosis, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n70",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
