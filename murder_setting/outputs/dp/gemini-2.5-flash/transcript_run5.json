Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This leads to a severe lack of oxygen, which directly causes **hypoxic damage to the brain**. Therefore, if Ben died, this specific injury would inherently be present as a consequence of the dying process. It would not be an injury that could develop *after* being brought to the hospital (except as a progression of the already ongoing process) or be absent at the time of arrival if death was imminent or had just occurred.\n\nSince \"hypoxic damage to the brain\" is explicitly listed as one of the \"injuries found on Ben\", and this injury would necessarily be present if Ben died (regardless of whether the cause was SIDS or smothering), it means that at least one of the listed injuries *was* present when Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nFor the statement \"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\" to be true, *all* of the listed injuries would have to be absent at that time. As we've established, the hypoxic damage to the brain would be present. Therefore, the premise that *all* of the injuries were not present is false.\n\nThe probability of a false statement being true is 0.\n\n0"

The injuries found on Ben are direct consequences of, or very strongly associated with, the act of smothering:\n\n1.  **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** Smothering directly causes a lack of oxygen, which leads to hypoxic brain damage. This damage would be present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, as it is a consequence of the lethal event.\n2.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These are often found in cases of asphyxia (like smothering) due to increased venous pressure during the suffocation process. These would also be present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital.\n3.  **Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord:** While less common than the others, these could result from forceful application during smothering or associated trauma. If caused by the act of smothering, they would also be present when Ben was brought to the hospital. These types of acute traumatic injuries do not typically develop after the child is brought to the hospital.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, these injuries would necessarily have been inflicted during the act and would have been present on Ben when he was brought to the hospital.

The case states that \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae\" in Ben. This means that in Ben's case, petechiae were absent.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of this *absence* of petechiae, *given that Jane is GUILTY* (i.e., Ben died from smothering).\n\nWhile petechiae are considered \"typical\" in smothering deaths, they are not present in 100% of cases. Their presence is more likely than their absence, but their absence is a recognized finding in a significant minority of asphyxial deaths. Factors like the exact mechanism of asphyxia, the duration, and individual physiological responses can influence whether petechiae develop and are visible.\n\nIf petechiae were *always* present in smothering, then their absence would mean a 0% likelihood if Jane were guilty. If they were *never* present, it would be 100%. Neither extreme is true.\n\nSince petechiae are \"typical,\" their presence is expected more often than their absence. Therefore, the likelihood of their *absence* (given smothering) must be less than 50%. However, their absence is not so rare as to be near 0%. Forensic literature suggests that petechiae can be absent in a notable proportion of asphyxia cases (e.g., 20-40% in some studies), making their absence a possibility, though not the most common finding.\n\nConsidering that they are \"typical\" (meaning more often present), but their absence is still a known occurrence, a probability less than 50% but not extremely low would be appropriate.\n\n30"

In this scenario:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty and Ben was smothered, resuscitation attempts would undoubtedly have been made on Ben. These attempts are a well-known cause of rib injuries, including dislocations, in infants. Therefore, finding dislocated ribs in this context is highly likely.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states that this \"is a common finding in natural death.\" This indicates that its presence does not *exclude* natural death. However, it does not mean it would be *unlikely* in a homicidal death either. Spinal bleeding can occur due to various factors during the dying process, or from trauma associated with the smothering, or it could simply be a non-specific finding. The phrasing \"common finding in natural death\" primarily serves to reduce its diagnostic value for smothering, rather than suggesting its absence if smothering occurred.\n\nSince resuscitation attempts (leading to dislocated ribs) would certainly have taken place if Ben died from smothering, and spinal bleeding is a general finding not excluded by a homicidal cause, the likelihood of these findings being present remains high. The explanations for these injuries given in the text largely decouple their presence from the specific cause of death (natural vs. homicidal), making their finding plausible in either scenario. Given that the likelihood was high (75) for the \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario, and the causal factors for these injuries are largely present regardless of guilt, a similar high probability is appropriate.\n\n70"

This is an inevitable consequence of the dying process. Therefore, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain is 100% likely if Ben died, irrespective of Jane's guilt.\n\n2.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The prompt states that these are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then there was no smothering or violent trauma. While these types of haemorrhages (petechiae) can occasionally occur in natural deaths due to terminal events, they are not a typical or expected finding in natural deaths like SIDS and are more strongly associated with asphyxia or trauma. The phrasing \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" highlights their relevance to non-natural causes.\n\nConsidering both findings together:\n*   The hypoxic damage is certain (100%) if Ben died.\n*   The haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, while *possible* in natural death, are not typically expected and are stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Therefore, their presence in a natural death scenario (NOT GUILTY) would be less likely.\n\nThe overall likelihood of *both* findings being present (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) if Jane is NOT GUILTY will be driven by the less likely component, which is the haemorrhages in a natural death. A low probability reflects that these haemorrhages are more indicative of the alternative (guilty) scenario, even if not entirely impossible in a natural death.\n\n20"
