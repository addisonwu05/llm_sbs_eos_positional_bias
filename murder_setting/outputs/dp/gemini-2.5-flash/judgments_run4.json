  "The question asks for the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were *not present* when he was brought to the hospital, *if Jane is NOT GUILTY*.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n1.  **Assume Jane is NOT GUILTY:** This means Jane did not smother Ben or inflict the injuries.\n\n2.  **Ben's Injuries:** The autopsy revealed \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\"\n\n3.  **\"Not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\":** This statement indicates that these injuries were not externally obvious or documented during the initial assessment by nurses. This could mean two things:\n    *   The injuries *were present* when Ben arrived but were internal, subtle, or required specific diagnostic procedures (like an autopsy) to be discovered. This is common for many internal injuries.\n    *   The injuries *were not present* when Ben arrived and developed sometime *after* his arrival at the hospital (e.g., during medical procedures like resuscitation efforts).\n\n4.  **Evaluating the likelihood of injuries developing *after* arrival (Scenario 2):**\n    *   **Resuscitation Efforts:** While vigorous resuscitation can sometimes cause injuries like rib fractures, it is highly improbable for resuscitation alone to cause the entire constellation of injuries described, especially:\n        *   **Spinal cord injuries:** While possible in extreme cases of mishandling, it's not a typical outcome of standard resuscitation.\n        *   **Hypoxic brain damage:** This condition usually occurs *before* resuscitation is needed, and is the reason for resuscitation. While resuscitation might fail to reverse it or even worsen it if prolonged and ineffective, it's not the primary cause of the initial hypoxic damage itself.\n        *   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids (especially retinal haemorrhages):** These are considered strong indicators of non-accidental trauma, such as abusive head trauma or traumatic asphyxia (smothering), and are very rarely, if ever, attributed solely to standard resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the specific and severe nature of the combined injuries, particularly the eye haemorrhages and spinal cord trauma, it is highly unlikely that they *all* developed as a consequence of medical intervention *after* Ben arrived at the hospital.\n\nTherefore, the most probable scenario is that these injuries were already present when Ben was brought to the hospital but were internal or not immediately apparent, and thus \"not noted by nurses.\" If the injuries *were* present upon arrival, then the probability that they were *not present* is very low.\n\nConsidering the remote possibility of some injuries being caused or exacerbated by resuscitation (though unlikely for the full spectrum), a very small probability can be assigned.\n\n5\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she caused Ben's death by smothering him, and the injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are attributed to her actions.\n\nSmothering and the resulting trauma would have occurred at home, *before* Ben was transported to the hospital. Therefore, if Jane is guilty of inflicting these injuries, these injuries would have been present in Ben's body when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe fact that the nurses \"noted no injuries\" simply means the injuries were not externally obvious or immediately visible upon initial examination, which is common for internal injuries like rib fractures, spinal cord damage, hypoxic brain damage, and retinal haemorrhages. It does not mean the injuries were absent.\n\nThus, if Jane is guilty, it is certain that the injuries she caused were present when Ben was brought to the hospital. Consequently, the likelihood that these injuries were *not present* when he was brought to the hospital is 0.\n\n0",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, this means she did not smother Ben or inflict the injuries.\n\nThe new information states:\n1.  \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death could be due to natural causes. If spinal bleeding is a *common* finding in natural death, then it's highly likely to be present if Ben died naturally.\n2.  \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Ben died and underwent resuscitation efforts. Rib injuries, including dislocations, are a known potential consequence of vigorous chest compressions during resuscitation. They can also occur due to post-mortem handling. Both these scenarios (death and resuscitation) are consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding can be explained by natural death (a common finding), and the dislocated ribs can be explained by resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes (a probable occurrence). These explanations are independent of any action by Jane.\n\nGiven that these findings are described as \"common\" or \"probable\" in situations consistent with Jane being not guilty (natural death, resuscitation, post-mortem), it is highly likely that these specific findings would indeed be found in Ben's autopsy report if Jane is not guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered Ben, causing his death.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of each finding:\n\n1.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" While Ben's death would not be natural if Jane is guilty, smothering is a traumatic event. Trauma, especially around the head and neck, can lead to spinal injuries, including bleeding. The initial autopsy report already mentioned \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord.\" Spinal bleeding is a specific manifestation of spinal cord injury. Therefore, even in a case of death by smothering (traumatic), spinal bleeding could be present either as a direct result of the trauma or as a co-occurring finding.\n\n2.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben would still have undergone resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation efforts are a well-known cause of rib injuries, including dislocations. Such injuries occurring during resuscitation are independent of the cause of death itself but are a consequence of the medical attempts to save the child. Post-mortem changes could also occur regardless of the cause of death.\n\nGiven that resuscitation attempts would have occurred regardless of Jane's guilt, and these attempts \"probably\" cause dislocated ribs, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly likely. Similarly, while spinal bleeding is common in natural death, it doesn't exclude its presence in a traumatic death like smothering, especially since the initial report indicated spinal cord injuries.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, these findings are still very likely to be present and reported.\n\n90",

  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered Ben.\n\nThe information states: \"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae\".\n\nThe question asks: \"If Jane is GUILTY, how likely is the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben?\"\n\n1.  **\"Typical injuries of a death due to smothering\":** This implies that petechiae are *commonly expected* to be found if smothering occurred.\n2.  **\"Absence of injuries such as petechiae\":** We are being asked about the likelihood of this *absence*, given that smothering *did* happen (Jane is guilty).\n\nIf petechiae are \"typical\" in smothering deaths, their presence is the more expected outcome. Therefore, their *absence* (even if possible) would be a less expected or less common outcome if smothering indeed occurred.\n\nWhile it is known that petechiae are not present in 100% of smothering cases (factors like the duration of asphyxia or the child's response can influence their appearance), their description as \"typical\" suggests that they are present in a significant majority of cases. If they are present in, for example, 70-80% of smothering cases, then they would be absent in 20-30% of cases.\n\nThus, if Jane is guilty, the absence of a \"typical\" finding like petechiae is possible but not the most probable scenario. The probability should reflect that it is less likely for this typical sign to be absent when the cause of death is indeed smothering.\n\n25",

  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered Andy. Regardless of the cause of death (smothering in this case), if a baby collapses and is declared dead, medical professionals would perform resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe statement explicitly says: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n\nThis means that the injuries found in Andy (bruises to arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are *expected* or *consistent* findings following resuscitation efforts. Since resuscitation attempts are an independent and highly probable event that would occur after Andy's collapse, the presence of these injuries due to resuscitation is highly likely.\n\nFurthermore, if Jane is guilty of smothering, some of these injuries (like bruises or a torn frenulum from struggle, or blood in the lung from asphyxia) could potentially also be direct results of her actions. However, the question focuses on the likelihood of the *presence* of these injuries. Since there is a strong and independent explanation for their presence (resuscitation attempts) that would occur whether Jane is guilty or not, the likelihood of finding these injuries remains high.\n\n90",

  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered Ben, which would cause severe hypoxia and subsequent hypoxic damage to his brain.\n\nThe question asks how likely it is that this hypoxic damage was caused \"a matter of hours before death,\" as alleged by the doctor.\n\nWhen an infant is smothered, the lack of oxygen (hypoxia) occurs rapidly. If this is a fatal event, the child will quickly become unresponsive and may die within minutes. However, it is also very common in cases of severe traumatic asphyxia or head injury (which can lead to hypoxia) for an infant to suffer severe brain damage but not die instantly. In such scenarios:\n1.  The initial hypoxic insult (the smothering event) might occur.\n2.  The child might then suffer severe brain damage but survive for a period.\n3.  The child is then discovered, an ambulance is called, and they are transported to the hospital.\n4.  Resuscitation efforts might be attempted and eventually fail.\n5.  Death is pronounced hours after the initial causative event, or the irreversible hypoxic damage is medically assessed as having occurred hours before the final pronouncement of death.\n\nTherefore, even if the act of smothering is relatively acute, the resulting irreversible hypoxic damage (which is what the doctor would be assessing) could indeed be determined to have been caused \"a matter of hours before death\" due to the progression of brain injury, the period of medical intervention, or the time elapsed between the initial insult and the final cessation of life. This timeframe is entirely consistent with severe inflicted injury leading to a protracted decline or a period of survival with severe damage.\n\nGiven that Jane is guilty and caused the hypoxic damage, it is highly likely that this damage, particularly severe damage leading to death, would be diagnosed as having occurred \"a matter of hours before death\" by medical professionals, even if the precise act of smothering was more acute.\n\n90",
