Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This tells us two key things:\n1.  Petechiae are considered \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\".\n2.  Petechiae were *not* found on Ben.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of the *absence* of petechiae, *given that Jane is NOT GUILTY*.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Ben did not die from smothering by Jane. Since petechiae are explicitly described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\", if death was not due to smothering, then the presence of petechiae would not be expected. Therefore, the *absence* of petechiae would be highly consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\nIn other words, if Ben was not smothered, it is highly probable that he would not exhibit a typical sign of smothering (petechiae). While it's possible for other non-smothering causes of death (e.g., other forms of asphyxia) to result in petechiae, the text specifically links petechiae to \"smothering\" and uses their absence as a noteworthy point in this case. Based solely on the information provided, if smothering is ruled out (by Jane being not guilty), then the absence of a \"typical injury\" of smothering is very likely.\n\n90"

If an injury is typical of a certain cause of death, it means that it is expected to be present in a significant majority of such cases.\n\nTherefore, if Ben died from smothering (i.e., Jane is guilty), we would *expect* to find petechiae. The question asks for the likelihood of the *absence* of petechiae in this scenario. If their presence is typical and expected, then their absence would be atypical and therefore less likely. The fact that the absence of petechiae is explicitly mentioned in the case description suggests it is a noteworthy finding that goes against the expected pattern for smothering, implying that their presence is indeed common.\n\nBased on this, the probability of petechiae being absent, given that Ben was smothered, should be relatively low (i.e., well below 50%). It's not impossible, as medical findings are rarely 100% consistent, but it is not likely if petechiae are \"typical\" signs.\n\n25"

They are not injuries that typically manifest or develop *after* arrival at the hospital or after death in a way that makes them \"not present\" upon admission.\n\nThe fact that nurses did not *note* these injuries does not mean they were *not present*. Nurses perform an initial assessment, which may not involve the detailed examinations or imaging (e.g., X-rays for ribs/spinal cord, or internal examination for brain/eye haemorrhages) required to detect such specific internal injuries. Many severe internal injuries are not immediately apparent during a standard external nursing assessment.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the injuries would still have been present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital.

    "content": "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben's death was caused by smothering.\n\nLet's consider the likelihood of each finding:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs**: The text states that dislocated ribs \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\". If Ben was smothered, he would have been found unwell and resuscitation attempts would almost certainly have been made (as the text mentions, \"Ben could not be resuscitated\"). Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly consistent with Jane being guilty, as they would be a very likely consequence of resuscitation efforts.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding**: The text states that \"the spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death\". If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was *not* a natural death; it was a homicidal death by smothering. While \"common in natural death\" does not mean \"exclusive to natural death,\" it strongly implies that spinal bleeding is *less common* or not a typical direct result of smothering. Therefore, its presence is less expected and less consistent with a death by smothering compared to a natural death. It might occur coincidentally, or in an atypical case of smothering, but it is not a direct or common consequence implied by the premise of guilt.\n\nCombining these:\nThe dislocated ribs are highly likely to be found if Jane is guilty due to resuscitation efforts. However, the spinal bleeding, being associated with natural death, is less likely to be a direct consequence or common finding in a smothering death. Therefore, the overall likelihood of finding both these injuries, given Jane is guilty, would be lower than if the death was natural, because one of the findings (spinal bleeding) points away from the premise of guilt as its likely origin or typical presence.\n\nConsidering one finding is highly likely (dislocated ribs) and the other is less likely (spinal bleeding in a smothering death, based on its \"natural death\" association), the combined probability will be lower than in the \"not guilty\" scenario (where both were highly likely).\n\n30"
