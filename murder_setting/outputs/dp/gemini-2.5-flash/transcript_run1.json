Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

A \"common finding\" implies a high probability of occurrence.\n\n2.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would have been unexpected, making resuscitation attempts highly likely. Post-mortem examination is also certain. If these events \"probably\" cause dislocated ribs, then the finding is highly probable given the circumstances.\n\nBoth findings are described with language ( \"common finding\" and \"probably occurred\") that suggests a high likelihood under the assumption of Jane's innocence. For these explanations to serve as a strong alternative to the murder charge, their probability under the 'not guilty' scenario must be substantial.

As a result of this finding, further tests... were carried out... Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by smothering them.\" This means the discovery of these injuries, including \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\" (of which spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are components), was the direct reason for Jane being charged with murder.\n\n2.  **Implication of Guilt:** If Jane is truly guilty, it implies that the forensic evidence leading to the charge was accurate and correctly interpreted as indicative of murder. The presence of these specific injuries, therefore, formed a crucial part of the case against her.\n\n3.  **Specific Findings:**\n    *   **Spinal bleeding:** This is a component of the \"injuries to the spinal cord\" that were discovered. If Jane is guilty, these injuries were present and contributed to the conclusion of murder. The statement \"common finding in natural death\" is an alternative explanation provided in the text, which would be part of the defense's argument if Jane were not guilty, but it doesn't negate the fact that spinal bleeding *was found* and considered relevant in the context of other injuries if she *is* guilty.\n    *   **Dislocated ribs:** This is a component of \"injuries to the ribs.\" Similar to spinal bleeding, if Jane is guilty, these injuries were present and part of the evidence. The alternative explanation that they \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\" is an attempt to explain them away as non-homicidal. However, even if Jane is guilty, resuscitation attempts would have occurred (as an ambulance was called), and a post-mortem examination definitely happened. Therefore, the conditions under which dislocated ribs \"probably\" occur would still be present. More importantly, the \"injuries to the ribs\" were part of the initial discovery that led to the charge.\n\nIn summary, if Jane is guilty, the findings that led to her being charged must have been present and accurately reflect the circumstances of death. Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are explicitly mentioned as parts of these key findings. Therefore, it is highly likely that these findings were discovered if Jane is indeed guilty.\n\n95"

The word \"probably\" suggests a high likelihood for this explanation.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states that \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Ben died of natural causes, this finding would be consistent with his death. As it's a \"common finding in natural death,\" it would likely be present *at the time of death or during the dying process*, meaning it would be present when he arrived at the hospital in a critical state. Thus, it is highly probable this injury *was present*.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain:** This type of damage is a direct consequence of the oxygen deprivation leading to death. If Ben died of natural causes, hypoxic damage would have occurred during the dying process. Therefore, it is highly probable this injury *was present* when he arrived at the hospital.\n\n4.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These can occur during oxygen deprivation or other stresses associated with the dying process in natural deaths. It is probable these injuries *were present* when Ben arrived at the hospital.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood that \"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\" This refers to the *set* of injuries. Since the dislocated ribs, a significant component of the overall findings, were highly likely *not* present at the time of admission, the entire *set* of injuries was not fully formed or present at that specific point. The fact that a key injury identified in the autopsy *developed later* (post-admission) makes the statement \"the injuries were not present\" largely true, as the full picture of the injuries was not yet there.\n\nConsidering the high probability (e.g., 80-90%) that the dislocated ribs were not present upon admission, and while other injuries likely were present, the absence of one prominent injury means the *full set* of injuries discovered at autopsy was not present.

Therefore, they would almost certainly have been present when Ben became unwell and was brought to the hospital.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** While the text mentions this is a \"common finding in natural death,\" it was also part of the set of \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\" that led to the murder charge. If Jane is guilty, it's highly probable that this injury, considered indicative of trauma or severe distress, would have been present at the time of the smothering incident and thus when he was brought to the hospital.\n\n3.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text explicitly states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben would have been in a critical condition or already deceased when brought to the hospital, necessitating resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation attempts occur *after* the patient is brought to the hospital or during transport. Post-mortem changes also occur after death. Therefore, regardless of Jane's guilt, it is highly probable that the dislocated ribs were *not* present when Ben was initially brought to the hospital but developed subsequently during medical intervention or after death.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood that \"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\" This implies that at least some, or the full picture, of the injuries were not present. Since the dislocated ribs, a significant part of the autopsy findings, are explicitly stated to \"probably\" have occurred *after* Ben was brought to the hospital (due to resuscitation or post-mortem changes), it means that the complete set of injuries discovered during the autopsy was not present at the time of admission.\n\nTherefore, even if Jane is guilty, it is highly probable that the dislocated ribs were not present upon arrival, which means the full spectrum of injuries found at autopsy was not present at that specific time.\n\n90"

However, \"typical\" does not mean universal or always present (100% of the time).\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, while petechiae would be *expected* to be found (as they are typical), their absence is not impossible. Forensic science acknowledges that not all typical signs are present in every case of smothering, due to various factors like the exact mechanism, duration, and individual physiological responses.\n\nSo, the likelihood of *not* finding a typical injury, given that the underlying cause (smothering) did occur, would be relatively low, but not zero. It represents an unusual, but recognized, variation in presentation. If it were extremely rare, its absence might be considered strongly exculpatory, but the narrative implies it's a point of consideration rather than an absolute contradiction.\n\nWe are looking for P(absence of petechiae | smothering occurred).

(P(Andy's initial injuries being from resuscitation | G) = 90% vs P(Andy's initial injuries being from resuscitation | NG) = 90%) - This point doesn't strongly differentiate, as resuscitation happens either way.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe most powerful evidence for guilt comes from the \"astonishing\" similarities between the two incidents and the re-evaluation of Andy's injuries as \"characteristic of smothering.\" It is highly improbable for two independent SIDS deaths to exhibit such a specific set of repeated circumstances (age, time, discovery by Jane alone) *and* for specific injuries \"characteristic of smothering\" to be present in one of them (Andy) and other injuries \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" in the other (Ben).\n\nWhile the absence of petechiae in Ben (a typical smothering injury) and the timeline for Ben's hypoxic damage (\"hours before death\") introduce some doubt, they do not entirely negate the stronger probabilistic shifts from the other pieces of evidence. The absence of a \"typical\" finding doesn't mean it's impossible for smothering to have occurred (e.g., 25% chance of absence if guilty), and medical interpretations can vary.\n\nGiven the cumulative weight of the \"astonishing similarities\" and the forensic interpretations linking key injuries to smothering/abuse in both children, the probability of guilt appears high.\n\n85"
