  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that Ben's death was not caused by her smothering. The alternative explanation provided in the background is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a natural, unexplained death.\n\nThe autopsy on Ben revealed:\n*   Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\n*   Hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain\n*   Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\n\nThese specific findings (especially in combination) are characteristic signs of non-accidental trauma, such as shaken baby syndrome or smothering, and are often used as evidence in child abuse cases. They are **not** consistent with a diagnosis of SIDS. By definition, SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion after a thorough investigation finds no explainable cause of death, and specifically no signs of trauma.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that Ben died from a natural cause like SIDS. If Ben died from SIDS, then the traumatic injuries listed above *would not have been present at all*. If these injuries *were* present, it would indicate a cause of death other than SIDS (namely, trauma), which would contradict the premise that Jane is not guilty (assuming her non-guilt implies a natural death).\n\nThus, if Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning Ben died of SIDS or another natural, non-abusive cause), it is certain that the traumatic injuries \"found on Ben\" (as described in the autopsy) were not actually present, because their presence would be inconsistent with a natural death. If they were not present at all, they were certainly not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\n100",
