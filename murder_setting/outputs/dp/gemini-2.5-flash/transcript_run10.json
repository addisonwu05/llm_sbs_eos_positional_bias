Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "The problem states a factual observation about Ben's case: \"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae (tiny red or purple spots that can appear on the skin).\" This means that the absence of petechiae in Ben is a known and observed fact.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of this specific, already observed fact (the absence of petechiae in Ben) *given that Jane is GUILTY* (meaning Ben was smothered by Jane).\n\nSince the absence of petechiae in Ben is a piece of evidence that has been explicitly stated as true in the case background, its likelihood, conditional on any hypothesis about the case (such as Jane being guilty), must be 100%, as long as the hypothesis does not logically contradict the observed fact. The hypothesis that Jane is guilty (i.e., Ben was smothered) does not contradict the observation that petechiae were absent. While petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering,\" meaning their absence is atypical if smothering occurred, the question is about the probability of an *observed fact*, not the probability of a future or unknown event. An observed fact has occurred and therefore has a 100% probability of being true, given any premise that does not render it impossible.\n\n100"

    "content": "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane. In this scenario, the alternative explanations for the injuries become highly relevant.\n\nThe background states: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\"\n\nThe question asks how likely it is that the injuries found on Ben (at autopsy) were *not present* when he was brought to the hospital.\n\n*   **Dislocated ribs:** The text explicitly states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Both post-mortem events and resuscitation attempts (which happen after the child is brought in or during the process of being brought in) mean the injuries were *not* present at the initial moment of arrival at the hospital. This points to a high likelihood that these specific injuries were not present.\n*   **Spinal bleeding:** This is described as a \"common finding in natural death.\" While it could potentially be present before arrival, it is an internal injury and wouldn't be externally visible or \"noted by nurses\" anyway. The text doesn't specify if it's a pre- or post-mortem finding in natural death, but it's consistent with a natural dying process.\n*   **Hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These could develop during the natural dying process before or around the time of hospital admission.\n\nHowever, \"the injuries found on Ben\" refers to the collection of injuries discovered. Given that a significant component of these injuries – the dislocated ribs – is explicitly stated to have \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" it is highly likely that this particular injury, and thus the full set of injuries as found at autopsy, was not present when Ben was initially brought to the hospital.\n\nThe fact that nurses \"noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\" is separate from whether they were *present*. Injuries can be present but not noted (e.g., internal injuries, or subtle external ones in an emergency). But the question is specifically about *presence*.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, the explanations for the ribs strongly support them *not* being present upon hospital arrival. Therefore, it's highly likely that at least some key injuries from the final autopsy report were not present at the time of admission.\n\n90"
