  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means she did not cause the injuries found on Ben. The question asks how likely it is that these injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital. This implies that the injuries either:\n1.  Developed or were caused *after* Ben was brought to the hospital, but before the autopsy.\n2.  Were misinterpreted findings in the autopsy that were not actual traumatic injuries indicative of the charges (e.g., related to SIDS or post-mortem changes).\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of these two scenarios, given that the \"injuries found on Ben\" include \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\" This constellation of injuries is highly characteristic of severe non-accidental trauma, such as abusive head trauma or smothering/asphyxia, which typically occurs *before* a child is brought to the hospital in a critical condition.\n\n**Scenario 1: Injuries caused after Ben was brought to the hospital.**\n*   It is extremely unlikely for this specific combination of severe traumatic injuries (rib and spinal cord fractures, widespread hypoxic brain damage, and retinal/eyelid hemorrhages) to occur *after* an infant is admitted to a hospital without extreme and deliberate harm by hospital staff or another individual in the hospital (which is not suggested and would be a separate, highly improbable scenario).\n*   While some medical interventions, like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause injuries such as rib fractures, they are highly unlikely to cause spinal cord injury, widespread hypoxic brain damage (unless the hypoxia was not addressed, rather than caused, by the intervention), and specific retinal hemorrhages. These are hallmark signs of pre-hospital trauma.\n\n**Scenario 2: Autopsy findings were misinterpreted and not actual traumatic injuries.**\n*   If Jane is not guilty, one possible alternative explanation for Ben's death is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). If Ben died of SIDS, then the findings described as \"injuries\" by the autopsy would either be misinterpretations (e.g., post-mortem changes mistaken for trauma), or conditions related to the terminal event of SIDS that are not indicative of non-accidental trauma. In this case, the *traumatic* injuries, as interpreted by the prosecution, would not have been present upon arrival.\n*   However, the question refers to \"the injuries that were found on Ben,\" implying these are actual physical findings. It is generally considered highly unlikely for a competent forensic pathologist to misinterpret such a severe and specific constellation of findings as non-accidental trauma if they were merely post-mortem changes or benign findings related to SIDS. The fact that Andy's initial post-mortem was re-examined and *then* found similar suspicious injuries further suggests the robustness of these findings as indicative of trauma.\n\nConsidering the strong forensic association of the specific injuries with pre-hospital trauma, and the low probability of such a combination arising *within* a hospital setting through medical intervention or other means without deliberate intent (and thus not implicating Jane if she's not guilty), it is highly probable that if these injuries were genuinely present and accurately diagnosed, they *were* present when Ben was brought to the hospital (even if nurses missed them, as stated in the background).\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that these severe and specific injuries *were not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital, even if Jane is not guilty, is very low.\n\n5",
