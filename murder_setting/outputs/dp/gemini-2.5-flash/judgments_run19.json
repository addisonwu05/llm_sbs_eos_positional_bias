  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means Ben's death was not caused by her smothering him.\n\nThe provided text states: \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae\". This tells us two key things:\n1.  Petechiae are considered \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\".\n2.  Petechiae were *not* found on Ben.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of the *absence* of petechiae, *given that Jane is NOT GUILTY*.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Ben did not die from smothering by Jane. Since petechiae are explicitly described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\", if death was not due to smothering, then the presence of petechiae would not be expected. Therefore, the *absence* of petechiae would be highly consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\nIn other words, if Ben was not smothered, it is highly probable that he would not exhibit a typical sign of smothering (petechiae). While it's possible for other non-smothering causes of death (e.g., other forms of asphyxia) to result in petechiae, the text specifically links petechiae to \"smothering\" and uses their absence as a noteworthy point in this case. Based solely on the information provided, if smothering is ruled out (by Jane being not guilty), then the absence of a \"typical injury\" of smothering is very likely.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben died due to smothering. The text states that petechiae are \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\". If an injury is typical of a certain cause of death, it means that it is expected to be present in a significant majority of such cases.\n\nTherefore, if Ben died from smothering (i.e., Jane is guilty), we would *expect* to find petechiae. The question asks for the likelihood of the *absence* of petechiae in this scenario. If their presence is typical and expected, then their absence would be atypical and therefore less likely. The fact that the absence of petechiae is explicitly mentioned in the case description suggests it is a noteworthy finding that goes against the expected pattern for smothering, implying that their presence is indeed common.\n\nBased on this, the probability of petechiae being absent, given that Ben was smothered, should be relatively low (i.e., well below 50%). It's not impossible, as medical findings are rarely 100% consistent, but it is not likely if petechiae are \"typical\" signs.\n\n25",
  "It is highly probable that the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) were already present when he was brought to the hospital, regardless of how they occurred or who caused them.\n\nThese types of injuries (traumatic fractures, internal haemorrhages, and brain damage from oxygen deprivation) are either acute events or consequences of an acute event that would have taken place before or during the collapse that led to Ben being brought to the hospital. They are not injuries that typically manifest or develop *after* arrival at the hospital or after death in a way that makes them \"not present\" upon admission.\n\nThe fact that nurses did not *note* these injuries does not mean they were *not present*. Nurses perform an initial assessment, which may not involve the detailed examinations or imaging (e.g., X-rays for ribs/spinal cord, or internal examination for brain/eye haemorrhages) required to detect such specific internal injuries. Many severe internal injuries are not immediately apparent during a standard external nursing assessment.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the injuries would still have been present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital. The likelihood of these significant injuries *not being present* at that time is extremely low.\n\n5",

  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben's death was caused by smothering.\n\nLet's consider the likelihood of each finding:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs**: The text states that dislocated ribs \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\". If Ben was smothered, he would have been found unwell and resuscitation attempts would almost certainly have been made (as the text mentions, \"Ben could not be resuscitated\"). Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly consistent with Jane being guilty, as they would be a very likely consequence of resuscitation efforts.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding**: The text states that \"the spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death\". If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was *not* a natural death; it was a homicidal death by smothering. While \"common in natural death\" does not mean \"exclusive to natural death,\" it strongly implies that spinal bleeding is *less common* or not a typical direct result of smothering. Therefore, its presence is less expected and less consistent with a death by smothering compared to a natural death. It might occur coincidentally, or in an atypical case of smothering, but it is not a direct or common consequence implied by the premise of guilt.\n\nCombining these:\nThe dislocated ribs are highly likely to be found if Jane is guilty due to resuscitation efforts. However, the spinal bleeding, being associated with natural death, is less likely to be a direct consequence or common finding in a smothering death. Therefore, the overall likelihood of finding both these injuries, given Jane is guilty, would be lower than if the death was natural, because one of the findings (spinal bleeding) points away from the premise of guilt as its likely origin or typical presence.\n\nConsidering one finding is highly likely (dislocated ribs) and the other is less likely (spinal bleeding in a smothering death, based on its \"natural death\" association), the combined probability will be lower than in the \"not guilty\" scenario (where both were highly likely).\n\n30",
