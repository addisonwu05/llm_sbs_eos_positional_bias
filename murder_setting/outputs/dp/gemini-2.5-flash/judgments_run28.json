  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Ben's death was due to natural causes or other events not attributable to her. The text provides specific information relevant to this scenario:\n*   \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would be considered a natural death. Therefore, finding spinal bleeding would be common.\n*   \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence, resuscitation attempts were made on Ben (\"Ben could not be resuscitated\"). Therefore, it is probable that the dislocated ribs resulted from these attempts.\n\nBoth statements indicate a high likelihood of these findings being present if Jane is not guilty. \"Common finding\" suggests a high probability (well over 50%), and \"probably occurred\" also suggests a high probability. Therefore, the likelihood of finding both these features, given Jane's innocence, is high.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, Ben's death was caused by smothering, not natural causes. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each finding under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Ben \"could not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead,\" meaning resuscitation attempts were indeed made. Therefore, regardless of whether Jane is guilty or innocent, the dislocated ribs are highly likely to have been found due to these attempts.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was not a natural death; it was a homicide. Therefore, the commonality of spinal bleeding cited in the text (i.e., in natural deaths) does not apply here. This means that, based on the provided information, spinal bleeding is *not* expected to be a common finding in a death caused by smothering. While its presence is not impossible (it could be a rare side effect or a coincidental finding), it is less likely to be found if the cause of death is smothering compared to a natural death.\n\nCombining these: The dislocated ribs are highly probable in the \"guilty\" scenario due to resuscitation attempts. However, the spinal bleeding is less probable, as its commonality is explicitly linked to natural death, which is contradicted by the \"guilty\" premise. The overall likelihood of finding both these features will therefore be a moderate probability, reflecting one highly probable finding and one less probable finding.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, Ben's death was due to natural causes or other non-homicidal events. Let's analyze the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts would have taken place either during transport or at the hospital, after Ben was brought in. Therefore, it is highly probable that these injuries were *not present* when Ben was initially brought to the hospital, but developed during subsequent medical interventions or handling. If they weren't present, they couldn't have been noted by nurses at arrival.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** This is described as a \"common finding in natural death.\" Spinal bleeding is an internal injury and would not be externally visible or detectable by nurses during an initial assessment upon arrival at the hospital. Therefore, even if internally present due to natural causes, it would *not have been noted* by nurses.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** This is internal damage resulting from a lack of oxygen and is not an externally observable injury that nurses would note upon initial presentation.\n\n4.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These could be internal (e.g., retinal hemorrhages) or external. If internal, they would not be noted by nurses. If external, and Ben's death was natural, their presence as externally observable injuries would be less expected than if trauma had occurred, making it plausible they were either not present, or were internal.\n\nGiven that the dislocated ribs most likely developed *after* being brought to the hospital, and the spinal bleeding and hypoxic damage are internal findings not observable by nurses, there is a very high probability that these injuries, as later found at autopsy, would not have been noted by nurses upon Ben's arrival at the hospital.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, Ben's death was caused by smothering. Let's analyze the likelihood that the specific injuries found at autopsy were *not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts would have taken place after Ben was discovered unwell, and likely continued at the hospital *after* he was brought in. Therefore, it is highly probable that the dislocated ribs were **not present** at the exact moment he was brought to the hospital.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain:** If Jane is guilty of smothering, this injury is a direct consequence of the lack of oxygen caused by the smothering. This process would have occurred *before* Ben was brought to the hospital, meaning the hypoxic damage **was present** in his brain upon arrival.\n\n3.  **Injuries to the spinal cord / spinal bleeding:** While the text notes spinal bleeding as a \"common finding in natural death,\" if Jane is guilty, the death is not natural. Smothering can involve trauma or severe stress, potentially leading to such injuries. If these spinal injuries were a consequence of the smothering, they would have been **present** when Ben was brought to the hospital. The text does not link spinal bleeding to post-mortem events or resuscitation attempts in the same way it does for dislocated ribs.\n\n4.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These can be caused by suffocation or smothering due to increased pressure. If caused by smothering, they would have been **present** when Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nConsidering all the injuries:\n*   Only the dislocated ribs were likely *not present* upon arrival.\n*   The hypoxic brain damage, spinal injuries, and eye/eyelid haemorrhages were likely *present* upon arrival, as they are direct consequences of the act of smothering, which occurred before he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe question asks how likely it is that \"the injuries\" (plural, implying the collection of injuries) were not present. Since the majority of the injuries, particularly those directly indicative of the cause of death (smothering), *were* present upon arrival, the overall likelihood that \"the injuries... were not present\" is low. The dislocated ribs prevent the probability from being 0, but the other critical injuries would have already existed.\n\n25",

  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then the deaths of Andy and Ben would be attributed to natural causes, with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) being the primary alternative explanation provided. Let's examine each similarity in light of this assumption:\n\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died:** Andy was 11 weeks old, and Ben was 8 weeks old. This age range (2-3 months) is a peak period for SIDS, which commonly occurs between 2 and 4 months of age. Therefore, if both deaths were due to SIDS, it would be highly likely for them to occur within this common age window.\n2.  **They both died at similar time of the day after just being fed:** SIDS often occurs during sleep, and infants are typically put to bed after feeding. This pattern is very consistent with the known circumstances surrounding many SIDS deaths.\n3.  **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** This is a common circumstantial fact for any infant death occurring at home, especially if one parent is primarily responsible for care during certain hours. If a sudden, unexpected death (like SIDS) occurs, the parent who is present and alone with the child will be the one to discover them. This is not unusual if the deaths are natural and Jane is a primary caregiver.\n\nWhile the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in one family is statistically rare, the question asks for the likelihood of *these specific similarities* given Jane's innocence. If Jane is not guilty, and two infant deaths occurred, SIDS is a plausible explanation. The listed similarities (age, time of discovery, and who discovered them) are all highly consistent with the known characteristics and common scenarios of SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty and the deaths are natural (like SIDS), it is very likely that these similarities would be observed.\n\n90",
