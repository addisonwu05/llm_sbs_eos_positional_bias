Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This suggests that if Ben's death was due to a natural cause, such as SIDS, the presence of spinal bleeding would not be unusual.\n\n2. **Dislocated ribs post-mortem or due to resuscitation**: The information provided indicates that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Ben's death was natural (SIDS), and not due to smothering or any other unnatural cause attributed to Jane, then it's plausible that the dislocated ribs were a result of resuscitation efforts rather than an indication of foul play.\n\nGiven that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to smothering or any other form of harm inflicted by her. In such a scenario, if we consider SIDS or another natural cause as the reason for their deaths, the findings in Ben's autopsy related to spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs need to be evaluated in the context of natural deaths and medical procedures (like resuscitation).\n\nThe spinal bleeding, being a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs, likely resulting from resuscitation attempts, would both be plausible in the context of a natural death or an unpreventable medical emergency.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, and the deaths were due to natural causes or factors unrelated to her actions, it is likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would still be found in Ben as these can be associated with natural death or the consequences of medical intervention.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs are attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes.\n\nHowever, if Jane smothered Ben, it's still possible to observe these findings because they are not directly contradictory to the act of smothering. The presence of these findings doesn't necessarily prove or disprove Jane's guilt directly.\n\nConsidering the information given and assuming Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these findings is still relatively high because they can be explained by factors other than the act of smothering itself (natural death or resuscitation attempts).\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
