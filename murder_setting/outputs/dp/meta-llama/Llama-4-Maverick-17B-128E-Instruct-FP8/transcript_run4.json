Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries found on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are not typical of SIDS. \n\nIf we assume Jane is not guilty, then the presence of these injuries on Ben suggests that they might have occurred post-mortem or were not directly related to Jane's actions. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could imply several things: the injuries were not visible or were not present at the time, or they were missed by the nurses.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consider the nature of the injuries and the likelihood of them being missed. The injuries described are significant and not subtle. If such injuries were present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it would be expected that they would be noticed by medical professionals, especially given the thorough examination that typically occurs in cases where a baby is brought in deceased or critically ill.\n\nThe probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is not guilty, hinges on understanding that the absence of a notation of these injuries by nurses doesn't necessarily mean they were not present but could mean they were not observed or documented.\n\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that these injuries could have occurred post-mortem, or that they were not easily observable at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, it's still a complex scenario. The post-mortem examination revealed these injuries, suggesting they were significant enough to be identified during an autopsy.\n\nGiven Jane's innocence, if we are to believe that the injuries occurred post-mortem or were not directly related to her actions, and considering the medical professionals would likely have noticed significant injuries, the likelihood that the injuries were not present or not observable when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards a plausible scenario, especially if we entertain the idea that they could have occurred after hospitalization or were not easily detectable at the time.\n\nHowever, the exact likelihood depends on various factors, including the nature of the injuries, the timing, and the handling of Ben's body post-mortem.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
