Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

These are indicative of trauma.\n\n3. **Initial Attribution of Injuries**: The injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. The context provided indicates that such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby.\n\nGiven that Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries were not a result of her actions (e.g., smothering). If we are to consider the alternative explanation that the injuries were due to resuscitation attempts or other non-criminal causes, we need to evaluate the likelihood based on the information given.\n\n- **Resuscitation Attempts**: The text suggests that injuries like those found in Andy can be consistent with resuscitation attempts. If Andy's injuries were indeed due to resuscitation efforts, and given that Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths were not due to her actions), then the presence of such injuries could be seen as plausible under the circumstances of attempted resuscitation.\n\n- **SIDS and Resuscitation Injuries**: SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it's considered when other causes of death are ruled out. If Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, and the injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts, this scenario aligns with Jane not being guilty.\n\nTo quantify the likelihood of Andy having such injuries if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability that the injuries were a result of resuscitation or another non-criminal cause.\n\nGiven the context that the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation attempts and there's an alternative explanation (SIDS or another natural cause) for the deaths, the likelihood of Andy having such injuries if Jane is not guilty hinges on the plausibility that these injuries resulted from medical interventions rather than inflicted trauma.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 60\n\nThis reflects a considered judgment based on the information provided, leaning towards the injuries being potentially related to resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty, but also acknowledging that the presence of significant injuries still requires a plausible explanation. \n\n60"

If she is guilty, it implies that she was responsible for the deaths and potentially for the injuries found on both Andy and Ben.\n\n2. **Injuries Found in Andy and Ben**: The injuries discovered in Ben were severe and included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. Upon re-examination, Andy was found to have bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These injuries are indicative of significant trauma.\n\n3. **Implication of Guilt**: If Jane is guilty, it means she inflicted the injuries that led to the deaths of Andy and Ben. The fact that similar injuries (indicative of trauma) were found in both children upon further investigation supports the notion that their deaths might not have been due to natural causes or SIDS alone.\n\nGiven Jane's guilt, the injuries found in Andy become more likely as they can be directly linked to her actions. The discovery of similar patterns of injury in both children strengthens the prosecution's case that both deaths were due to non-natural causes.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering her children, it is reasonable to infer that the injuries found in Andy were a result of her actions. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical of SIDS or natural causes but are consistent with inflicted trauma.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of Andy having such injuries is high because it supports the narrative that she inflicted harm on both children.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 90\n\nThis high probability reflects the strong likelihood that if Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the injuries found in Andy would be consistent with her actions, aligning with the charges brought against her.\n\n90"

The new information suggests that these specific injuries could have alternative explanations (natural death for spinal bleeding and resuscitation or post-mortem for dislocated ribs) that do not necessarily directly implicate Jane's guilt in terms of causing these specific injuries.\n\nHowever, if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, while potentially explainable by other factors, does not directly contradict her guilt. The guilt is related to the act of smothering, and the presence of these injuries does not necessarily impact the likelihood of her having committed the act.\n\nGiven that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs have plausible alternative explanations (natural death and resuscitation/post-mortem handling, respectively), the likelihood of these findings is not directly dependent on Jane's guilt regarding the act of smothering.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Ben had spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs if Jane is guilty is still relatively high because these injuries are explained by other factors.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 80\n\nThis indicates that even if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs is still likely due to the other plausible explanations provided.\n\n80"

The absence of petechiae does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the presence or absence of such signs can vary greatly depending on the specifics of the case.\n\n2. **Jane's Guilt**: If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it means that she caused his death through asphyxiation or a similar mechanism.\n\nThe absence of petechiae or other typical signs of smothering in a victim does not preclude the possibility that smothering occurred.

The innocence of Jane implies that Andy's death and injuries should be attributed to other causes, such as accidental trauma, natural causes, or SIDS, which are less likely to result in such significant and multiple injuries.\n\nThe likelihood of these injuries being present in Andy if Jane is not guilty is relatively low because they are more commonly associated with inflicted trauma rather than natural causes or accidents.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 10\n\nThis reflects a low likelihood that if Jane is not guilty, Andy would have these significant injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), as they are indicative of non-accidental trauma.\n\n10"

The injuries found in Andy are typical of non-accidental trauma, which aligns with the scenario that Jane is guilty.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 95\n\nThis indicates a very high likelihood that if Jane is guilty, Andy would have these injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung), as they are consistent with the nature of the abuse or smothering implied by her guilt.\n\n95"

While there are some uncertainties and complexities in the case, the cumulative effect of the evidence points towards Jane's guilt.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 85\n\nThis reflects a high likelihood that Jane is guilty based on the evidence presented, including the similarities between the incidents, the nature of the injuries found in both children, and the medical testimony.\n\n85"
