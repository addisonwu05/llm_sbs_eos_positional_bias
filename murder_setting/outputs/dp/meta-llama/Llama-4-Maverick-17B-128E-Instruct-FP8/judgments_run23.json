  "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the evidence and the probability assessments, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis verdict is based on the preponderance of evidence suggesting that Jane caused the deaths of her two sons, Andy and Ben, through smothering or other forms of abuse. The similarities between the two deaths, the presence of injuries indicative of abuse, and the medical expert's statements collectively support this conclusion."
