Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries in question include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. Initially, these were attributed to resuscitation attempts.\n\n1. **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These can occur during resuscitation efforts, especially in infants, due to the fragility of their skin and the force applied during chest compressions or handling.\n\n2. **Torn frenulum**: This is a common injury in infants that can result from a fall or, relevantly, from resuscitation efforts that involve forceful or improper handling of the baby's mouth or face.\n\n3. **Blood in the lung**: This could be related to the attempt to resuscitate the infant. Aggressive or improper resuscitation techniques can cause internal injuries.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be due to SIDS or another natural cause, not due to smothering by Jane.\n\nThe injuries discovered in Andy were initially thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts. If we assume Jane is not guilty and Andy's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of these injuries could still be explained by the attempts to revive him.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high because they can be attributed to the resuscitation efforts, which would have been undertaken after Andy was found unresponsive.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
