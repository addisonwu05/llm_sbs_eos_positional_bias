Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The fact that these were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests a few possibilities:\n\n1. The injuries could have been subtle or not immediately apparent, potentially missed during the initial examination.\n2. The injuries could have occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the assumption might be that the trauma did not occur at her hands. Therefore, the injuries would have had to occur either before she called for medical help (but were not visible or diagnosed at the hospital upon arrival) or after Ben was admitted.\n\nHowever, medical professionals, especially in emergency settings, are trained to identify and document signs of trauma or distress in infants. It's less likely that significant injuries such as those described would be completely missed upon initial examination unless they were not apparent at the time or were internal injuries that didn't manifest externally.\n\nThe probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on whether it's plausible that medical staff missed these injuries upon initial examination or that they occurred post-admission.\n\nGiven that the injuries were significant and related to internal trauma (some of which might not be immediately visible externally), it's still possible that they were not immediately noted by nurses, especially if the initial focus was on resuscitation efforts.\n\nHowever, without more specific information on the nature of the medical examination and the condition of Ben upon arrival, we're left to reason based on the information given.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and assuming the injuries were not inflicted by her, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital would depend on the plausibility of them occurring post-admission or being missed.\n\nThe injuries described are severe and indicative of significant force or trauma. It is generally unlikely that such extensive internal injuries would occur in a hospital setting without being noticed or documented, especially in the context of an infant being treated for a life-threatening condition.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, and we're considering the injuries not being present upon hospital admission, we must weigh the plausibility of these injuries occurring post-admission or being undetected.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

The scenario suggests that Jane discovered Ben was unwell, and then she and her husband called an ambulance.\n\nFor the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, they would have had to occur after Jane called for medical help or after Ben was admitted to the hospital.
