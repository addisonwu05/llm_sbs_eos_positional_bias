Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the information given.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand that if Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to other causes such as SIDS, as suggested in the background. The injuries found on Ben (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) and on Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are indicative of potential non-accidental injury, which is a critical piece of evidence against Jane.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks us to assume Jane is not guilty. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries might have another explanation or might not be related to her actions.\n\nThe fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital introduces several possibilities:\n1. The injuries could have been subtle or not immediately apparent.\n2. The injuries might have occurred after Ben was admitted to the hospital.\n\nGiven that Jane is assumed not guilty, we are looking at a scenario where the injuries might not be directly related to her actions. The question then becomes about the likelihood that these injuries were not present at the time of hospital admission.\n\nThe injuries described are significant and would likely be detected during a thorough medical examination, especially in a hospital setting where infants are carefully assessed. However, it's possible that they were not immediately obvious or were not present at the time of admission.\n\nTo determine the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, we must consider the nature of the injuries and the hospital's procedures. The injuries suggest a significant traumatic event or events. \n\nIf we assume Jane is not guilty and consider that the injuries might have another cause or occurred post-admission, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of these alternative explanations.\n\nGiven the assumption of Jane's innocence and without specific evidence to suggest that the injuries occurred after hospital admission, we can still reason based on the information typically available in such cases.\n\nThe probability judgment should be based on the plausibility that significant injuries could be missed during initial hospital assessment and the likelihood of such injuries occurring post-admission.\n\nProbability: 20"

The injuries found on Ben are significant and indicative of non-accidental trauma.\n\nFor Jane to be guilty, it is likely that she caused the injuries to Ben before his death. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that either the injuries were not immediately apparent or they were not present at that time.\n\nHowever, if Jane is guilty and caused the injuries, it is more plausible that the injuries were present before or at the time she called for medical help. The alternative - that the injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital - is less likely if Jane is guilty because it implies someone else or another event caused the injuries post-admission.\n\nGiven Jane's guilt, the most straightforward interpretation is that she inflicted the injuries before bringing Ben to the hospital's attention. Therefore, it is less likely that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's guilt, is low because it contradicts the straightforward implication of her guilt, which is that she caused the injuries before calling for medical help.\n\nProbability: 5"

However, the presence or absence of petechiae is not definitive proof of smothering or its absence.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and assuming the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to another cause such as SIDS, the absence of petechiae would be expected because SIDS does not typically involve the kind of force or asphyxiation that leads to petechiae.\n\nThe absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with a scenario where Ben's death was not due to smothering or a similar form of asphyxiation. If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to a cause like SIDS, it is reasonable to expect that Ben would not have injuries such as petechiae associated with smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben is relatively high because it aligns with an alternative cause of death that does not involve smothering or similar mechanisms that could cause petechiae.\n\nProbability: 80"

Many cases of smothering or asphyxiation do not result in petechiae.\n\nIf Jane is guilty and smothered Ben, the absence of petechiae does not necessarily contradict this. The absence of such injuries could be due to various factors, including the method and force used in smothering, the duration of the asphyxiation, and individual physiological responses.\n\nThere are documented cases where individuals have died from smothering or asphyxiation without displaying petechiae. Therefore, the absence of petechiae in Ben does not rule out the possibility that Jane smothered him.\n\nGiven the guilt of Jane and assuming she smothered Ben, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae is plausible and somewhat expected due to the variability in presentation of asphyxiation injuries.\n\nProbability: 60"
