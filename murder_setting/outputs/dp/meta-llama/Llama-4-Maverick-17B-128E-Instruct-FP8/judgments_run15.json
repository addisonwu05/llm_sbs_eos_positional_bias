  "Based on the evidence presented and analyzed, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe cumulative evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma or abuse in both babies, and the medical evidence consistent with smothering or asphyxiation, strongly supports the conclusion that Jane intentionally caused the deaths of her children.\n\nTherefore, my verdict is: **Guilty**"
