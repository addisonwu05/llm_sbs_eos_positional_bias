Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.\n\nFirst, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths and injuries to the infants could be attributed to other causes, such as SIDS or other accidental or natural causes.\n\nThe injuries found on Ben included injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries that would likely be apparent or suspected upon a thorough medical examination.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then the assumption is that she did not cause these injuries. In that case, the injuries could have occurred due to other reasons or could have been misinterpreted.\n\nThe fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could be due to several reasons:\n1. The injuries might not have been visible or apparent at the time of admission. Some injuries, especially internal ones, might not be immediately visible without a thorough autopsy or specific diagnostic tests.\n2. The medical staff might not have conducted a thorough examination for such injuries at the time of admission, focusing instead on immediate care and resuscitation efforts.\n3. The injuries could have occurred post-mortem or during the resuscitation efforts, although this is more controversial and depends on the nature of the injuries.\n\nHowever, if we are to assume Jane's innocence and consider alternative explanations for the deaths and the injuries, it's crucial to evaluate the likelihood based on the given information and medical understanding.\n\nGiven that the question is about the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, and assuming Jane is not guilty, we're essentially assessing the plausibility of the injuries not being detected or not being present at the time of hospital admission.\n\nThe injuries described are significant and would likely be detected during a thorough examination. However, the fact that they were not noted by nurses suggests either they were not apparent or not looked for.\n\nTherefore, considering Jane's innocence, one plausible interpretation is that the injuries could have been misattributed or not immediately evident. However, the probability that they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital leans towards being low because significant injuries like those described (especially internal ones) would likely be detected during an autopsy even if not immediately noted.\n\nGiven these considerations and the need to make a judgment based on the provided scenario, the likelihood that the injuries were not present is relatively low because it is likely that such significant injuries would have been caused before death or during the agonal period.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"
