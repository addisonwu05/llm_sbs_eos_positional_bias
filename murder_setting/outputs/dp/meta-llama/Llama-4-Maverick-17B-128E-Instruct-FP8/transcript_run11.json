Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The presence of spinal bleeding could initially seem inconsistent with a simple smothering. However, if the death was due to a more violent or forceful act, such as shaking or squeezing, it could potentially cause such injuries. Nevertheless, the information given suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, which complicates the interpretation.\n\n2. **Dislocated ribs**: The dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts. If Jane is guilty, the fact that dislocated ribs were found does not directly implicate her, as it is explained by factors (resuscitation attempts) unrelated to her guilt.\n\nThe key here is understanding that if Jane is guilty, the prosecution's case relies on the interpretation that the injuries (initially thought to be suspicious) were not due to natural causes or accidental means. However, the given explanations for the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs (natural death and resuscitation attempts, respectively) do not directly support the guilt scenario based on these specific findings alone, as they provide alternative explanations.\n\nGiven this, we're assessing the likelihood of these specific findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) occurring if Jane is guilty. The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural deaths, and dislocated ribs are attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem changes. Thus, these findings don't directly support or refute Jane's guilt based on the given explanations.\n\nHowever, since we're conditioning on Jane being guilty, we are implicitly considering a scenario where her actions led to the death.
