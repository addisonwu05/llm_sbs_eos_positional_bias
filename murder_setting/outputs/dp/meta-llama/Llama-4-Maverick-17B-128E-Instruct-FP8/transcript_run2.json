Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries in question were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts.

The key point here is that the injuries were initially thought to be a result of resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if Andy's death was sudden and unexpected, such as in the case of SIDS.\n\nGiven that resuscitation attempts can cause such injuries, and if we are considering a scenario where Jane is not guilty (implying Andy's death could be due to a cause like SIDS), the likelihood of these injuries being present would depend on whether the resuscitation efforts were vigorous or typical.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of resuscitation attempts can vary, and it's known that such attempts, especially on infants, can result in various injuries due to the fragility of their tissues.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Andy's death was sudden and led to vigorous resuscitation attempts (as one might expect in a case where a baby is found unresponsive), the presence of injuries like bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be reasonably expected due to the resuscitation efforts.\n\nThus, the likelihood of these injuries being found in Andy, given that Jane is not guilty, is quite plausible because they can be attributed to the resuscitation attempts.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
