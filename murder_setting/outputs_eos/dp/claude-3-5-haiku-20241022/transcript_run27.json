    "content": "Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of\nthe case:\nAfter Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.\nWhen Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to\nbed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Injuries not noted by nurses:\n- Medical professionals often miss subtle injuries\n- However, significant injuries like rib and spinal damage seem unlikely to be completely overlooked\n\n2. Absence of petechiae:\n- Petechiae are typically expected in smothering cases\n- Their absence could suggest alternative explanations for death\n- This supports a potential natural cause scenario\n\n3. Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:\n- The text states these are common in natural deaths\n- Could be post-mortem or from resuscitation attempts\n- Provides reasonable doubt about intentional injury\n\n4. Andy's injuries:\n- Initially attributed to resuscitation\n- Consistent with revival attempts\n- No definitive proof of intentional harm\n\n5. Additional context:\n- SIDS is rare but plausible (1 in 4,000)\n- More common in male infants\n- Two infant deaths are statistically unusual but not impossible\n\nConsidering the multiple uncertainties, alternative explanations, and lack of conclusive evidence of deliberate harm, there's a substantial probability that Jane might not be guilty.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"
