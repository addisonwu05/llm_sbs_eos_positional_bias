Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Nurses did not initially note the injuries on Ben when he was brought in\n4. No typical smothering injuries like petechiae were found\n5. Andy's initial injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts\n6. SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 cases, which is statistically rare but not impossible\n7. Two infant deaths in the same family is extremely unusual but not definitively proof of murder\n\nThe lack of typical smothering evidence, the potential alternative explanations for injuries, and the medical expert statements suggesting some injuries could be post-mortem or from resuscitation provide reasonable doubt.\n\nWhile the circumstances are suspicious, the evidence does not conclusively prove intentional murder. The combination of unusual but potentially explicable medical findings suggests there's a meaningful probability of an alternative explanation.\n\nConsidering all the nuanced medical and circumstantial evidence, and giving Jane the benefit of the doubt based on the presented information, the probability that these deaths were NOT intentional murders seems substantive.\n\nProbability Judgment: 65"

Injuries on Ben suggest potential physical trauma\n3. Initial lack of injury documentation by nurses could indicate attempts to hide evidence\n4. Spinal bleeding and rib dislocation could potentially be manipulated to look like natural causes\n5. Andy's initial autopsy suggesting natural causes was later re-examined with evidence of potential trauma\n6. No petechiae (typical smothering injury) doesn't necessarily rule out smothering, as not all smothering cases show these marks\n7. The pattern of two infants dying under similar circumstances with Jane as the sole caregiver is highly suspicious\n\nMedical and forensic literature shows cases of infanticide where perpetrators carefully avoid leaving typical trauma signs. The absence of definitive smothering markers doesn't prove innocence, especially given the repeated infant deaths.\n\nThe convergence of multiple suspicious factors - two infant deaths, hidden injuries, and Jane's presence in both scenarios - strongly suggests intentional harm.\n\nWhile not 100% conclusive, the evidence points strongly toward guilt and the likelihood that the injuries and circumstances are not coincidental.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

Hypoxic brain damage specifically timed hours before death is a strong indicator of intentional harm\n4. Bruises, torn frenulum, and lung blood in Andy are classic signs of physical trauma\n5.
