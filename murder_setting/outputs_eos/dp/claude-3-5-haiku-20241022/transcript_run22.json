Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses initially, which could indicate they occurred after hospital admission.\n\n2.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a recognized phenomenon, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and is more common in boys.\n\nThese factors suggest there is a reasonable possibility that the injuries were not deliberate and could have alternative explanations such as natural causes, resuscitation effects, or post-mortem changes.\n\nWhile the coincidence of two infant deaths is unusual, the evidence presented does not conclusively prove intentional harm.\n\nThe medical and forensic details provided introduce significant uncertainty about the cause of death and the presence of injuries.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"

The subsequent investigation revealing bruises on Andy's body that were initially overlooked suggests potential deliberate harm.\n\n4.
