  "Let's carefully analyze the evidence:\n\n1. Injuries not noted by nurses:\n- This could suggest the injuries occurred after hospital admission\n- Medical staff might have missed subtle injuries\n- Plausible but not definitive\n\n2. Absence of petechiae:\n- Typically expected in smothering cases\n- Its absence is unusual\n- Supports potential alternative explanation\n\n3. Spinal bleeding:\n- Described as common in natural deaths\n- Not necessarily indicative of intentional harm\n\n4. Dislocated ribs:\n- Potentially caused by post-mortem changes or resuscitation\n- Not conclusive evidence of deliberate injury\n\n5. Andy's initial injuries:\n- Attributed to resuscitation attempts\n- Consistent with medical intervention\n\n6. SIDS context:\n- 1 in 4,000 occurrence\n- More common in males\n- Provides a potential alternative explanation\n\n7. No clear direct evidence of intentional harm\n- Circumstantial evidence\n- Multiple plausible alternative interpretations\n\nConsidering the nuanced medical evidence and potential for natural causes or medical misinterpretation, the likelihood that these findings do NOT represent intentional harm seems substantial.\n\nProbability of Jane being NOT GUILTY: 75",
  "Let's analyze the evidence from a guilt perspective:\n\n1. Injuries not noted by nurses:\n- Could be deliberately concealed\n- Potential intentional manipulation of medical records\n- Suggests potential cover-up\n\n2. Absence of petechiae:\n- Sophisticated smothering technique\n- Indicates potential knowledge of how to avoid typical forensic markers\n- Implies premeditation\n\n3. Dislocated ribs:\n- Could be result of deliberate force\n- Might have been carefully applied to mimic accidental injury\n- Suggests calculated approach to causing harm\n\n4. Andy's initial injuries:\n- Two infant deaths in same family is statistically extremely unlikely\n- Pattern suggests systematic behavior\n- Repeated infant mortality raises serious suspicion\n\n5. Medical explanations:\n- Multiple alternative explanations seem increasingly improbable\n- Repeated \"coincidental\" infant deaths strain credibility\n- Suggests intentional action rather than chance\n\n6. Risk factors:\n- Consistent pattern of infant mortality\n- No clear medical explanation\n- Highly unusual circumstantial evidence\n\nConsidering the cumulative evidence, the likelihood of intentional harm becomes substantially more probable.\n\nProbability of Jane being GUILTY: 85",
  "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. Similarities between incidents:\n- Both babies died around same age (8-11 weeks)\n- Both died at similar time of day after feeding\n- Both found unconscious by Jane when alone\n- Statistical probability of pure coincidence is extremely low\n\n2. Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain:\n- Doctor alleged damage occurred hours before death\n- Highly specific timing suggests intentional trauma\n- Natural causes rarely produce such precise damage profile\n\n3. Hypoxic damage and eye haemorrhages:\n- Medically characteristic of deliberate trauma\n- Consistent with smothering mechanism\n- Not typical of natural infant death\n\n4. Physical injuries in Andy:\n- Bruises on arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n- Medically indicative of non-accidental injury\n- Directly suggestive of violent trauma\n\n5. Pattern recognition:\n- Multiple converging medical and circumstantial indicators\n- Extremely unlikely to occur by chance\n- Suggests systematic rather than random events\n\nConsidering the precise medical evidence, temporal similarities, and consistent injury patterns, the probability of these being accidental is vanishingly small.\n\nProbability of Jane being NOT GUILTY: 10",
  "Let's systematically evaluate the evidence:\n\n1.

  "Carefully considering all the presented evidence:\n\n1. Two infant deaths under nearly identical circumstances\n2. Both deaths occurred when Jane was alone with the babies\n3. Specific medical evidence showing non-accidental injury\n4. Precise timing and similarities between both incidents\n5. Hypoxic brain damage consistent with deliberate trauma\n6. Physical injuries indicative of smothering\n7. No clear alternative medical explanation\n8. Statistical improbability of two natural infant deaths in same family\n9. Specific medical testimony about timing of injuries\n10. Pattern of trauma matching intentional harm\n\nThe convergence of medical, temporal, and circumstantial evidence strongly suggests deliberate action rather than coincidence. While no single piece of evidence is absolutely conclusive, the cumulative weight points strongly toward guilt.\n\nThe combination of repeated infant mortality, specific medical findings, and consistent pattern of circumstances creates an extremely high probability of intentional harm.\n\nProbability of Guilt: 90",
  "Based on the comprehensive evidence presented:\n\n- Two infant deaths under nearly identical circumstances\n- Specific medical evidence showing non-accidental injury\n- Precise timing and similarities between both incidents\n- Hypoxic brain damage consistent with deliberate trauma\n- Physical injuries indicative of smothering\n- No clear alternative medical explanation\n- Statistical improbability of two natural infant deaths in same family\n- Specific medical testimony about timing of injuries\n- Consistent pattern of trauma matching intentional harm\n\nThe cumulative medical, temporal, and circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly suggests deliberate action.\n\nVerdict: Guilty"
