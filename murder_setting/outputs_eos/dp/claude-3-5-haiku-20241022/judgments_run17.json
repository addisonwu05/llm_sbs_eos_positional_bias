  "Let's carefully analyze the key points:\n\n1. Injuries on Ben not noted by nurses initially suggests they might have occurred later or were not present.\n\n2. Absence of petechiae is unusual for a smothering death, which typically shows these tiny hemorrhagic spots.\n\n3. Spinal bleeding is noted as common in natural deaths, not necessarily indicative of intentional harm.\n\n4. Dislocated ribs could be post-mortem or from resuscitation attempts.\n\n5. Andy's initial injuries were attributed to resuscitation, which shows medical professionals can misinterpret trauma.\n\n6. SIDS is rare but possible (1 in 4,000), and more common in boys.\n\n7. Multiple unexplained infant deaths in a family are statistically unusual but not impossible.\n\nThe presence of multiple alternative explanations and the lack of definitive proof of intentional harm suggests a significant probability that the injuries were not deliberately inflicted.\n\nConsidering the medical uncertainties, lack of conclusive evidence of intentional harm, and plausible alternative explanations, I assess the likelihood of Jane being not guilty based on these specific injury considerations as:\n\n70",
  "Let's analyze the key points from a perspective supporting guilt:\n\n1. Two infant deaths in the same family is statistically extremely rare and suspicious.\n\n2. The first death (Andy) was initially overlooked, but subsequent investigation revealed hidden injuries.\n\n3. Ben's autopsy showed significant injuries (to ribs, spinal cord, brain, eyes) that suggest non-accidental trauma.\n\n4. While nurses didn't initially note injuries, forensic examination later revealed clear trauma.\n\n5. The absence of petechiae does not definitively rule out smothering, as injury patterns can vary.\n\n6. Dislocated ribs could potentially be from intentional force rather than just resuscitation.\n\n7. The pattern of two infant deaths under similar circumstances with hidden injuries strongly suggests deliberate harm.\n\n8. Medical experts have found suspicious underlying patterns in the injuries.\n\nThe convergence of multiple suspicious factors, the pattern of two infant deaths, and the forensic evidence of injuries suggest a high probability of intentional harm.\n\nConsidering these factors and the potential for intentional injury, I assess the likelihood of Jane being guilty based on these specific injury considerations as:\n\n85",
  "Let's analyze the key points:\n\n1. Striking similarities in both incidents:\n- Both babies around same age (8-11 weeks)\n- Both died after feeding\n- Both found unconscious by Jane when alone\n- Statistically, these coincidences are extremely unlikely to occur naturally\n\n2. Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain:\n- Specifically timed hours before death\n- Medical expert testimony suggests deliberate trauma\n- Highly unlikely to be coincidental\n\n3. Injuries in Andy:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n- These are classic indicators of physical abuse and smothering\n- Medical evidence strongly suggests non-accidental injury\n\n4. Ben's additional evidence:\n- Haemorrhages to eyes and eyelids\n- Consistent with violent trauma\n- Multiple independent indicators point to intentional harm\n\nThe convergence of multiple specific, medically-corroborated similarities and injury patterns across two separate incidents is extraordinarily improbable as a natural occurrence.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest an extremely low probability of these incidents being accidental or coincidental.\n\n15",
