Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital and other related facts if Jane is not guilty, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Injuries found on Ben not noted by nurses**: The fact that the injuries on Ben were not observed by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital could suggest that they might have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately apparent. If Jane is not guilty, this supports the possibility that the injuries were not present or not noticeable when Ben was admitted.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's autopsy could be consistent with a natural death or an alternative cause that doesn't involve smothering. This is plausible if Jane is not guilty.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben**: The information that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths and that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts aligns with the possibility that these injuries are not indicative of smothering or foul play. If Jane is not guilty, this interpretation supports the natural cause or accident hypothesis.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: Initially attributing Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts is plausible, especially since such injuries can be consistent with attempts to revive a baby. If Jane is not guilty, the presence of these injuries being explained by resuscitation efforts is a reasonable hypothesis.\n\nConsidering these points:\n- The injuries on Ben not being noted by nurses could be plausible if they were not immediately apparent or occurred post-mortem.\n- The absence of typical smothering signs in Ben and the plausible alternative explanations for the injuries found support the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty.\n- The explanation for Andy's injuries being due to resuscitation attempts is also plausible.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or another natural cause), the likelihood of the described observations (injuries not present or noted upon hospital admission, absence of typical smothering signs, plausible alternative explanations for the injuries) is relatively high.\n\n80"

However, some injuries related to smothering or violent shaking could be present at the time of hospital admission.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering could suggest that either the smothering did not leave typical signs or that there was no smothering. However, it's also possible for smothering to occur without leaving such signs, making this observation not entirely inconsistent with guilt.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem**: If Jane is guilty, the fact that dislocated ribs can be attributed to resuscitation efforts or post-mortem changes doesn't directly support or refute her guilt since it doesn't necessarily link to smothering directly.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy attributed to resuscitation attempts**: If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, attributing Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts might be a plausible explanation to cover up the actual cause. However, it also remains a possible genuine explanation.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the described observations (especially the absence of typical smothering signs and plausible alternative explanations for the injuries) are true would be relatively low because it requires that the smothering did not result in typical signs or that the injuries were not noticed or were attributed to other causes.\n\n20"

SIDS or natural causes could potentially explain individual incidents but the similarities between the two incidents are unusual.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and its timing**: The hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death, as alleged, could be consistent with a violent act or smothering if Jane is guilty.
