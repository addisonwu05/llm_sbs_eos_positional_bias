Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses, the absence of typical smothering injuries, and the plausible alternative explanations for the injuries in both Andy and Ben (resuscitation attempts or natural causes) all support the scenario that Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, considering the information and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural causes), the probability of observing the given evidence or more extreme is relatively high because the evidence can be explained by factors other than smothering.\n\n80"

The absence of such injuries does not strongly support or refute guilt but makes it less clear-cut.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben attributed to post-mortem or resuscitation**: If Jane is guilty, the dislocated ribs could be seen as potentially resulting from her actions. However, the scenario given attributes them to post-mortem or resuscitation attempts, which doesn't directly support or refute her guilt directly regarding the cause of the ribs' condition.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: If Jane is guilty, it's plausible she could have caused injuries to Andy. However, the initial attribution of these injuries to resuscitation attempts and the fact that they were only re-evaluated after Ben's autopsy results suggest that the evidence against Jane might not be as strong as it initially seems if one is to assume her guilt based on these injuries alone.\n\nConsidering Jane is guilty, the given explanations for the injuries and the absence of certain signs (like petechiae) make the scenario somewhat less likely because:\n- The injuries not being noticed by nurses could happen but doesn't strongly support guilt.\n- The absence of typical smothering signs is not uncommon.\n- The alternative explanations for the injuries (resuscitation, post-mortem) reduce the direct implication of guilt.\n\nHowever, the overall likelihood still depends on how plausible it is for a guilty person to have caused the observed injuries without leaving the typical signs of smothering, and for those injuries to be explainable by other factors.\n\n20"

The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000, making the probability of two consecutive SIDS deaths in the same family (1 in 4,000) * (1 in 4,000), which is 1 in 16,000,000.

However, the presence of injuries indicative of smothering or abuse in both children and the striking similarities between the two incidents make this scenario highly improbable.\n\nThe probability of two SIDS deaths is already very low, and the additional similarities and presence of injuries indicative of non-natural causes further reduce the likelihood of Jane's innocence.\n\n1"

    "content": "To determine the probability that Jane is guilty based on the given evidence, let's summarize the key points and analyze them.\n\n1. **Initial Autopsy Results and Re-examination**: Initially, Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, but upon re-examination after Ben's autopsy, injuries indicative of abuse were found. Ben's autopsy directly showed injuries consistent with smothering or violent trauma.\n\n2. **Similarities Between Incidents**: Both children died at similar ages, under similar circumstances, and were found by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities are striking.\n\n3. **Evidence of Smothering or Abuse**: The presence of specific injuries in both children (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung for Andy; hypoxic damage, haemorrhages for Ben) suggests a non-natural cause of death.\n\n4. **Alternative Explanations**: The defense that the deaths could be due to SIDS is weakened by the low probability of two consecutive SIDS deaths in the same family and the presence of injuries indicative of abuse.\n\n5. **Analysis of Likelihoods**:\n   - If Jane is not guilty, the probability of the observed evidence (similarities and injuries) is very low (previously judged as 1).\n   - If Jane is guilty, the probability of the observed evidence is relatively high (previously judged as 90).\n\nGiven these analyses, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update the probability of Jane's guilt based on the evidence. Initially, without any evidence, the probability of guilt is 50% (or 0.5), as there are two outcomes: guilty or not guilty.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P(G) as the prior probability of guilt = 0.5\n- P(E|G) as the probability of evidence given guilt = 0.9\n- P(E|~G) as the probability of evidence given not guilty = 0.01\n\nThe formula to update the probability of guilt given the evidence, P(G|E), is:\n\\[ P(G|E) = \\frac{P(E|G) \\times P(G)}{P(E|G) \\times P(G) + P(E|~G) \\times P(~G)} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P(G|E) = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.5}{0.9 \\times 0.5 + 0.01 \\times 0.5} \\]\n\\[ P(G|E) = \\frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.005} \\]\n\\[ P(G|E) = \\frac{0.45}{0.455} \\]\n\\[ P(G|E) \\approx 0.989 \\]\n\nTo convert this to a percentage:\n\\[ 0.989 \\times 100 = 98.9 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest integer as requested:\n99"
