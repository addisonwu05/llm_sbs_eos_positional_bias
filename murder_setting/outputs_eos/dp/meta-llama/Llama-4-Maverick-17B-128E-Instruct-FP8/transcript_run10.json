Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital and the other given conditions if Jane is not guilty, we need to analyze the information provided in the context of the case.\n\n1. **Injuries found on Ben not being present when brought to the hospital**: If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or during the handling of the body after she called the ambulance. The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital supports the possibility that they could have occurred after hospital admission or were not easily observable at the time.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries due to smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: Smothering typically results in certain characteristic signs, such as petechiae. The absence of these signs in Ben's autopsy could suggest that smothering might not have been the cause of death, supporting Jane's innocence.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben**: The information provided suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This indicates that these injuries might not necessarily be indicative of foul play or smothering.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: The re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs revealing bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could initially suggest non-accidental injury. However, if Jane is not guilty, these findings need to be considered in the context of alternative explanations or the possibility that they were not correctly interpreted.\n\nConsidering Jane is not guilty implies that the deaths could be due to natural causes or other factors not related to smothering by Jane. The likelihood of the observed conditions (injuries not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, absence of typical smothering signs, and the nature of the injuries found in both Ben and Andy) being consistent with her innocence involves assessing whether these conditions could plausibly occur without Jane's guilt.\n\nGiven the information and assuming Jane's innocence, the injuries and autopsy findings could be explained by a combination of natural causes (like SIDS), the handling and resuscitation attempts of the infants, and potentially misinterpreted or post-mortem injuries.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption of Jane's innocence, the probability that the observed injuries and conditions are consistent with the given scenario is relatively high because they can be explained by factors other than smothering.\n\n70"

If the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, it suggests they could have occurred after she called the ambulance or were not easily observable. This seems less likely if Jane is guilty of smothering, as it would imply the injuries were not directly related to the cause of death or occurred post-mortem.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries due to smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: Smothering does not always result in characteristic signs like petechiae. However, their absence could make it harder to confirm smothering as the cause of death. If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of these signs is not necessarily inconsistent, as smothering can occur without leaving such marks.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben**: If Jane is guilty, the dislocated ribs could potentially be related to her actions. However, the information provided suggests that dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, which doesn't directly support the idea that Jane's guilt is linked to these specific injuries.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) upon re-examination could be seen as consistent with non-accidental injury, potentially supporting the notion that Jane was responsible for Andy's death as well.\n\nConsidering Jane is guilty implies that she was responsible for the deaths of both children, potentially through smothering. The likelihood of the observed conditions given Jane's guilt involves assessing how well these conditions align with the possibility of smothering or other forms of non-accidental injury.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering signs and the explanation for some injuries (like dislocated ribs) being due to other factors (resuscitation or post-mortem) somewhat complicates the picture. However, if Jane is guilty, it's plausible that the injuries were either not noticed or not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, and some of the autopsy findings could still be consistent with her actions or be misinterpreted.\n\nGiven these considerations, the scenario presents a mixed picture. However, the probability that the observed conditions are consistent with Jane's guilt, while not straightforward, is still plausible.\n\n20"

The similarities between the incidents and the specific injuries found in both babies are highly suggestive of a non-coincidental cause. If Jane is not guilty, one would expect the deaths and injuries to be explainable by other factors. However, the specific and similar nature of the findings in both cases makes this challenging without invoking coincidence or a rare natural cause.\n\nThe probability of these specific and similar conditions occurring in both cases without Jane being guilty is low because the evidence strongly points towards a non-accidental, potentially related cause.\n\n5"
