  "Let's break down the likelihood of the observations if Jane is not guilty, considering alternative explanations like SIDS and resuscitation efforts.\n\n*   **Injuries on Ben not present at the hospital:** If Jane is not guilty, the injuries on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts. It's plausible that some injuries, particularly bruising, could develop or become more apparent after death or during medical intervention. Therefore, it is reasonably likely the injuries were not noted when Ben arrived at the hospital.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are often associated with smothering, but their absence does not definitively rule it out. Other factors, such as the method of smothering or individual physiological differences, could explain their absence. If the child died of SIDS, the absence of petechiae is more expected.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben:** The provided information states these are common in natural deaths and could occur post-mortem or during resuscitation. If the death was due to SIDS followed by resuscitation attempts, these findings are consistent with that explanation.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy:** The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation, and the information suggests they are consistent with resuscitation efforts. It seems likely that the injuries found on Andy are consistent with resusitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information, the evidence suggests a plausible alternative narrative: both children died of SIDS or similar natural causes, with some injuries occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation. Considering the possible innocent causes, I would put the probability judgment at:\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, then the scenario becomes more complicated. We need to assess how likely it is that the presented information would *still* be observed if she committed the murders.\n\n*   **Injuries on Ben not present at the hospital:** If Jane inflicted the injuries related to smothering, it's possible some external injuries (e.g. bruising) might *not* have been immediately apparent or documented by nurses upon arrival. Bruising, for instance, can develop or worsen over time. The smothering might not have caused visible external marks initially. So, it's possible, but not certain.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** The lack of petechiae is more challenging. While not *always* present in smothering cases, they are a relatively common sign. Their absence would need to be explained if Jane is guilty. Perhaps she was careful or used a method that didn't consistently cause petechiae. It slightly decreases the probability.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben:** The fact that spinal bleeding can occur naturally or post-mortem, and ribs can dislocate during resuscitation, offers a potential explanation. It's plausible that Jane's actions caused some internal trauma, and the later events (death, resuscitation) masked or contributed to these specific findings.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy:** The injuries on Andy, explained by resuscitation attempts, becomes more problematic. It suggests Jane's method might have consistently led to situations where resuscitation was necessary and caused the injuries seen.\n\nConsidering all of this, if Jane is guilty, the presented observations are somewhat unexpected, but not impossible. A guilty Jane would need to have acted in a way that didn't leave immediately obvious marks, and that mimicked or was obscured by natural causes or resuscitation efforts. This decreases probability.\n\n35\n",
  "Okay, let's assess the likelihood of these new pieces of evidence given Jane's innocence.\n\n*   **Similarities between incidents:** The similarities (age, time of day, Jane being alone) are concerning, *even* if Jane is innocent. It suggests a pattern, which, while not conclusive proof of guilt, lowers the probability of innocence. These similarities would need to be explained by coincidence or other factors that predispose infants to SIDS-like events at similar ages and times of day, and while alone with the caregiver.\n\n*   **Hypoxic damage shortly before death:** This is problematic. If the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death and Jane is innocent, this suggests some other acute event or undiagnosed condition caused it very shortly before the baby died. That is a difficult condition to have.\n\n*   **Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages consistent with smothering:** This statement is also problematic. These findings are consistent with smothering, which makes it much less likely that the death was from other natural causes.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy indicative of abuse and smothering:** This is the most damaging piece of evidence against an innocent Jane. If the injuries are truly *indicative* of abuse and smothering, it's very difficult to reconcile with her innocence. It would require arguing that the injuries were misinterpreted or misattributed, or that some other rare event caused them.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the cumulative effect of these points makes Jane's innocence extremely unlikely. The coincidences, the hypoxic damage shortly before death, and the evidence of abuse on both children (particularly Andy) severely reduce the probability of her being not guilty.\n\n10\n",
  "Let's evaluate the likelihood of these facts if Jane is guilty.\n\n*   **Similarities between incidents:** If Jane deliberately harmed both children, the similarities in the circumstances of their deaths (age, time of day, Jane being alone) become *much* more probable. It suggests a pattern of behavior, a specific vulnerability she targeted, or a particular routine she exploited.\n\n*   **Hypoxic damage shortly before death:** The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before Ben's death aligns with a deliberate act like smothering. It means the injury was not from a long-term condition or event far removed from death. It increases probability.\n\n*   **Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages consistent with smothering:** If Jane smothered Ben, the presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages expected from smothering is highly probable, as it fits the method of death.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy indicative of abuse and smothering:** Finding evidence of abuse and smothering in Andy's case provides a crucial link between the two deaths. If Jane is guilty, these findings are highly likely, as they represent evidence that points to similar causes for the two deaths.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the presented observations are precisely what one would expect to find. The consistent method, the injuries found, and the specific circumstances surrounding the deaths all support her guilt.\n\n95\n",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence, especially the similarities between the two deaths, the hypoxic damage shortly before death, the injuries to Ben, and the evidence of abuse and smothering in Andy's case, the probability of Jane's guilt is very high.\n\n90\n",
