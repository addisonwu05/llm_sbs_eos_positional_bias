  "If Jane is GUILTY, we evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital (i.e., not noted by nurses):** If Jane smothered Ben, she inflicted injuries. Some of these injuries (e.g., rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage) are internal and might not be immediately obvious. Even external injuries like haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids could be missed or not fully documented during the urgency of resuscitation attempts. Therefore, it is plausible that these injuries, though present, were not immediately noted by nurses upon arrival.\n    *   *Likelihood: Moderate to High*\n\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If Jane smothered Ben, the absence of a *typical* sign makes this specific presentation less common, but not impossible. Smothering does not always result in petechiae, depending on factors like the duration and method. This is the strongest piece of evidence in the list that *reduces* the likelihood of a \"textbook\" smothering scenario.\n    *   *Likelihood: Low to Moderate*\n\n3.  **Dislocated ribs found in Ben:** If Jane smothered Ben, she might have used force, potentially causing rib dislocations. Alternatively, the text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would inevitably follow. Therefore, the presence of such injuries is highly likely whether caused directly by Jane's actions or as a consequence of medical intervention following her actions.\n    *   *Likelihood: High*\n\n4.  **Injuries found in Andy:** Similarly, if Jane smothered Andy, she would have caused trauma (e.g., a torn frenulum suggests force to the mouth, bruises suggest a struggle). The text also states these injuries \"are consistent with attempts to revive a person.\" Just as with Ben, if Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would follow. Thus, the presence of these injuries is highly likely, whether caused directly by Jane or by the subsequent medical intervention.\n    *   *Likelihood: High*\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe hypothesis of Jane's guilt (smothering) provides a strong explanation for the presence of significant injuries in both children, some of which are highly indicative of abuse (e.g., torn frenulum, hypoxic brain damage, eye haemorrhages, though these specific details are from the background and not directly listed in the question, they form the basis of the charge related to the \"injuries found\"). The fact that some of these injuries can also be attributed to resuscitation efforts does not detract from the \"guilty\" hypothesis, as resuscitation would be a direct consequence of the smothering.\n\nThe main factor that makes this specific set of evidence less than perfectly \"typical\" for smothering is the absence of petechiae in Ben. While not impossible for smothering, it's an anomaly. The fact that Ben's injuries were not noted by nurses upon arrival is plausible, especially given the internal nature of some injuries and the urgency of the situation.\n\nConsidering the evidence collectively, the presence of injuries in both children that are consistent with smothering and subsequent resuscitation is a strong fit with the \"guilty\" hypothesis. The absence of petechiae slightly lessens this fit, but does not render the entire scenario unlikely.\n\nGiven the strength of the positive injury findings that led to the charges, balanced against the less-than-typical absence of petechiae, the overall likelihood is moderately high.\n\n68",
