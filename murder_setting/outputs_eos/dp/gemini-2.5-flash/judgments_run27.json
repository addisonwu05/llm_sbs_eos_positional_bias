  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that her children died of natural causes (such as SIDS) or other non-homicidal reasons, and any injuries observed were due to natural processes, resuscitation attempts, or occurred post-mortem. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane is not guilty, Ben did not suffer inflicted injuries before being brought to the hospital. Therefore, it is highly likely that nurses would not have noted any such injuries at that time. This finding is entirely consistent with innocence.\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are typical signs of smothering or asphyxia. If Jane is not guilty of smothering Ben, then the absence of these typical smothering injuries is a strong indicator supporting her innocence. This is highly likely if she is not guilty.\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The background explicitly states: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would be natural, and these findings are directly explained as common occurrences in natural death, post-mortem changes, or medical interventions. This is highly likely under the innocence hypothesis.\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The background states: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is not guilty, Andy's death would be natural, and these injuries are explicitly presented as being consistent with the efforts made to save him. This is highly likely under the innocence hypothesis.\n\nEach piece of evidence listed in the question is presented with an explanation that directly supports or is highly consistent with Jane being NOT GUILTY. The question asks for the likelihood of these specific findings and their non-homicidal interpretations *if Jane is truly innocent*. Since these explanations are the very ones that would explain the findings in a non-homicidal context, their occurrence (or the validity of these explanations) is very likely if Jane is indeed innocent.\n\nTherefore, the collective likelihood of these points being true, given Jane's innocence, is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering Ben, then the injuries found on him (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) *were present* when he was brought to the hospital, as they would be a direct consequence of the smothering event.\n\nThe question asks: \"If Jane is GUILTY, how likely is it that the injuries found on Ben *were not present* when he was brought to the hospital...?\"\n\nSince, under the hypothesis of guilt, these injuries *were present* (as they are the result of her actions before he was brought to the hospital), the likelihood that they *were not present* is 0.\n\nIf even one condition in a conjunction has a 0% likelihood, the entire conjunction has a 0% likelihood. Therefore, based on a strict interpretation of the wording:\n\n0",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that the deaths of both children were due to natural causes (such as SIDS) or non-homicidal events. We must assess the likelihood of the described evidence occurring under this hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** Both babies died at a similar young age (8 and 11 weeks), at similar times of day after feeding, and were found by Jane when she was alone. While individual SIDS cases are tragic, the recurrence of SIDS in one family with such striking similarities in circumstances is statistically unlikely and raises significant suspicion. If Jane is truly not guilty, these similarities must be attributed to extraordinary coincidence or an unknown familial predisposition to SIDS under these specific conditions, which is a low probability event.\n\n2.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** If Ben died of natural causes, it is plausible for a prolonged period of respiratory or cardiac distress leading to death to cause hypoxic damage over a matter of hours. This specific timing is not inherently inconsistent with a natural, though severe, medical event.\n\n3.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The text explicitly states that these are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these injuries must have occurred naturally. While some forms of haemorrhages can occur naturally in infants, particularly during severe dying processes, the combination with hypoxic damage and its consistency with violent trauma makes a purely natural explanation for this specific set of injuries significantly less likely. This is a strong point of evidence against the NOT GUILTY hypothesis for this particular finding.\n\n4.  **The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** The text states that \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then this initial interpretation is the correct one. Therefore, the presence of these injuries, explained by resuscitation efforts, is highly likely under the NOT GUILTY hypothesis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Andy's injuries are readily explained by resuscitation if Jane is innocent, the other points are problematic. The striking similarities between the two deaths are highly coincidental if both were natural. Most critically, the combination of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to Ben's eyes and eyelids is explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma,\" and the case background does not offer a similarly strong \"natural cause\" explanation for *this specific combination* (unlike spinal bleeding or dislocated ribs). For Jane to be innocent, these injuries must be a natural occurrence that coincidentally mimics inflicted trauma. The likelihood of all these points being true, especially the problematic ones regarding Ben's haemorrhages and the highly similar circumstances of both deaths, is low under the assumption that Jane is not guilty.\n\n20",
