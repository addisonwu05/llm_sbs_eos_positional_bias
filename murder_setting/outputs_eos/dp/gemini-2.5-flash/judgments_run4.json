  "If Jane is GUILTY (i.e., she smothered both children), let's assess the likelihood of each specified condition:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states: \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" This implies the injuries *were* present but overlooked, or were internal/subtle. Ben's injuries included internal ones (ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic brain damage) and potentially external ones (haemorrhages to eyes and eyelids). Given the emergency situation and the internal nature of many injuries, it is plausible that some or all were not immediately noted by nurses focusing on resuscitation. Let's estimate this likelihood as moderately high, say **70%**.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text states: \"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae...\" If petechiae are \"typical\" signs of smothering, their absence makes this an atypical case of smothering. If, for example, petechiae are present in 70-80% of smothering cases, then their absence occurs in 20-30% of cases. This particular observation is less likely if Ben was smothered. Let's estimate this likelihood as **25%**.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states: \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben was smothered, and resuscitation attempts would have followed. It is highly likely that if resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes can cause dislocated ribs, then such ribs would be found and attributed to those actions, regardless of the smothering. This is highly consistent with guilt. Let's estimate this likelihood as **90%**.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similarly, if Jane is guilty, Andy was smothered, and resuscitation attempts would have followed. It is highly likely that if resuscitation attempts can cause these injuries, then they would be found and attributed to those actions. This is highly consistent with guilt. Let's estimate this likelihood as **90%**.\n\nTo find the combined likelihood of these four independent events occurring *given* Jane is GUILTY, we multiply their probabilities:\n0.70 (nurses not noting) * 0.25 (absence of petechiae) * 0.90 (Ben's ribs from resus/PM) * 0.90 (Andy's injuries from resus) = 0.14175\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer: 0.14175 * 100 = 14.175%, which rounds to 14.\n\n14",
  "To determine the likelihood of these four conditions if Jane is NOT GUILTY, we must consider how plausible each piece of evidence is under the assumption that the children died from natural causes (e.g., SIDS or other natural illnesses) and not from Jane's actions.\n\n1.  **The similarities between both incidents (same age, similar time after feeding, Jane alone):**\n    *   If Jane is not guilty, these are coincidences. While two SIDS deaths in one family are rare, their occurrence at similar ages (2-3 months is peak SIDS age) and times (after feeding, when put to bed) are common patterns for infant deaths. However, Jane being alone with both children when they were found unconscious is a significant coincidence for two independent natural deaths. \"Astonishing\" implies a low probability of this occurring by chance.\n    *   *Likelihood if NOT GUILTY: Approximately 25%* (Unlikely for a natural occurrence, but not impossible, especially if she is the primary caregiver often alone with them.)\n\n2.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:**\n    *   If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would be natural. SIDS is typically sudden. However, a natural death could also result from an undiagnosed underlying medical condition (e.g., cardiac or respiratory) that caused a period of prolonged hypoxia before death. This would indicate a natural death, but not a typical SIDS.\n    *   *Likelihood if NOT GUILTY: Approximately 40%* (Plausible if Ben had an undetected natural medical condition, rather than SIDS.)\n\n3.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:**\n    *   These findings \"are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is not guilty, these must have arisen from natural causes. While less common, certain natural events in infants, such as severe respiratory distress, prolonged struggling, or extreme vomiting during a medical emergency, could potentially lead to hypoxic damage and petechial haemorrhages in the eyes/eyelids, even if they are often associated with asphyxia. The previous text also mentioned \"spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death,\" which may contextualize some findings.\n    *   *Likelihood if NOT GUILTY: Approximately 25%* (Possible, but not typical for a straightforward natural death; would require a more severe natural medical event.)\n\n4.  **The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:**\n    *   These injuries were found during a re-examination and are now described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" However, the initial assessment was that \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n    *   If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then the injuries were caused by resuscitation attempts (a highly likely event following an infant collapse). For these resuscitation-induced injuries to then be *re-interpreted* as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" implies a significant medical misinterpretation or diagnostic error. The question asks about the likelihood of *these injuries being present (as described)*. The description includes the interpretation by the doctor. So, for Jane to be not guilty, such injuries would need to be present due to benign causes (resuscitation) AND be misinterpreted by experts. While concerning, medical disagreements and misinterpretations are possible in complex cases.\n    *   *Likelihood if NOT GUILTY: Approximately 30%* (Plausible that resuscitation injuries could be present and then later misinterpreted as abuse, especially when another suspicious death has occurred.)\n\nTo find the combined likelihood, we multiply these probabilities, assuming they are independent:\n0.25 (similarities) * 0.40 (Ben's hypoxia hours before death) * 0.25 (Ben's hypoxia + haemorrhages) * 0.30 (Andy's injuries as described) = 0.0075\n\nConverting this to a percentage: 0.0075 * 100 = 0.75%.\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, this is 1.\n\n1",
