  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or other non-criminal reasons. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" This means the dislocated ribs were highly likely not present when Ben was brought to the hospital. For other injuries (hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages, spinal bleeding), the fact that \"the injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\" suggests they were either very subtle, not present, or developed during the process of dying or resuscitation. This collectively makes it highly likely that the observed injuries were not present upon arrival.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is not guilty (meaning Ben was not smothered), then the absence of typical smothering injuries is a highly expected finding.\n\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Both of these findings are directly explained as consistent with natural death or events following it, without implication of guilt. Thus, their presence is highly likely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text clarifies, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This directly states that the injuries found on Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are consistent with resuscitation efforts. If Jane is not guilty, resuscitation attempts would have been made, making these injuries highly likely.\n\nIn summary, every piece of evidence listed in the question is explicitly explained within the provided background as being consistent with Jane's innocence (i.e., natural death, post-mortem changes, or resuscitation attempts). Therefore, the likelihood of observing all these pieces of evidence if Jane is not guilty is very high.\n\n85",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered both children. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that \"the injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Ben was smothered, he would likely have sustained serious injuries (hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages, spinal cord injuries) prior to arrival. While it's possible some subtle injuries might be missed by nurses, or that dislocated ribs occurred during resuscitation or post-mortem (as indicated), it is less likely that *all* the significant injuries associated with smothering were entirely absent upon arrival or completely unnoted. However, the wording \"not noted\" leaves room for them being present but overlooked. This makes it a moderate likelihood.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, petechiae are generally considered a *typical* sign due to increased pressure. Therefore, the *absence* of such a typical injury makes this finding less likely if smothering was indeed the cause of death. This is a significant point against the \"guilty\" hypothesis.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty and smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would certainly have been made. Therefore, dislocated ribs are highly consistent with resuscitation efforts following a smothering death, making this a highly likely finding.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have been made. Therefore, injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts are highly likely to be found even if Jane is guilty.\n\nConsidering all points, the absence of petechiae (a *typical* sign of smothering) is the most significant factor that makes the combined scenario less likely if Jane is guilty. While other factors (dislocated ribs, Andy's injuries) are highly consistent with resuscitation following a smothering death, and \"injuries not noted\" is moderately plausible, the explicit lack of typical smothering signs in Ben substantially reduces the overall probability.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means the deaths were due to natural causes (e.g., SIDS) or other non-criminal reasons. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this assumption, considering the provided interpretations:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** While SIDS recurrence is rare and the specific similarities (age, time, discovery by Jane alone) are striking, it's not entirely impossible for two natural deaths to share these common circumstances. However, the exact combination of these factors makes it less probable for two *separate, natural* events.\n2.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** SIDS is typically described as \"sudden.\" A period of \"hours before death\" for hypoxic damage suggests a more prolonged decline, which is less consistent with the very sudden nature often associated with SIDS.\n3.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The text explicitly states these findings \"are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these findings would have to be explained by natural causes. The direct consistency with violent trauma makes their occurrence due to natural causes, especially in combination, very unlikely.\n4.  **The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death:** The text explicitly states these findings \"are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these findings would have to be explained by natural causes or resuscitation (as initially suggested). However, the re-examination's conclusion that they are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" directly contradicts the \"NOT GUILTY\" premise for these specific injuries. Therefore, the presence of injuries *with this interpretation* is highly unlikely if Jane is not guilty.\n\nConsidering the cumulative effect of these points: two deaths with striking similarities, Ben's hypoxic damage with a prolonged timeline, and critically, the explicit medical conclusion that key findings in *both* children are consistent with or indicative of smothering/violent trauma. If Jane were NOT GUILTY, it is very improbable that the evidence would so strongly and consistently point towards guilt.\n\n10",
