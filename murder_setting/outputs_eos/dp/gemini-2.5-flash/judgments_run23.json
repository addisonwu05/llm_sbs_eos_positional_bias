  "Here's an analysis of the likelihood of the described evidence if Jane is NOT GUILTY:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If this is the case, these specific injuries would indeed not have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital. For other injuries (hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages, spinal bleeding), if they are natural causes or internal, they might not be outwardly noted by nurses during initial triage. This statement is therefore plausible and somewhat supported if Jane is not guilty.\n\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states that petechiae are \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means Ben was *not* smothered. Therefore, the *absence* of petechiae is what would be expected and is highly consistent with Jane's innocence.\n\n3.  **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:**\n    *   **Spinal bleeding:** The text states: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Ben died of natural causes (consistent with Jane being not guilty), then this finding is highly likely.\n    *   **Dislocated ribs:** The text states: \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts would have occurred if Ben died of natural causes. This finding is highly consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\n4.  **Injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung):** The text states: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Andy died of natural causes (consistent with Jane being not guilty), then resuscitation attempts would have occurred, making these injuries consistent with that scenario.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nEvery piece of evidence listed in the question is presented with an explanation within the provided text that makes it either common, expected, or highly consistent with Jane being NOT GUILTY (i.e., the children died of natural causes and/or injuries resulted from resuscitation attempts). The cumulative effect of these explanations strongly indicates that the described findings are *not unlikely* if Jane is innocent. In fact, many of them are explicitly stated to be expected or common under such circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the likelihood of observing this specific set of evidence if Jane is not guilty is very high.\n\n85",
  "Here's an analysis of the likelihood of the described evidence if Jane is GUILTY of smothering her children:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** It is plausible that internal injuries (like hypoxic damage or haemorrhages) or injuries that occurred during resuscitation (like dislocated ribs, mentioned later) would not be immediately noted by nurses upon arrival, even if Jane is guilty. This finding is reasonably consistent with guilt.\n\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is GUILTY of smothering, the *absence* of a \"typical injury of a death due to smothering\" is a significant counter-indicator. While not every smothering death will show petechiae, their absence makes the specific finding less likely if smothering was the cause, as they are described as \"typical.\"\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text notes these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would certainly have been made. Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly consistent with Jane being guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung):** Similar to Ben, these injuries are described as consistent with \"resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have followed. Therefore, the presence of these injuries is highly consistent with Jane being guilty.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nTwo of the points (Ben's dislocated ribs and Andy's injuries) are highly consistent with Jane being guilty, as they are explained by resuscitation attempts that would follow a smothering incident. The point about Ben's injuries not being initially noted by nurses is also plausible.\n\nHowever, the \"absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\" is a critical piece of evidence that makes the scenario *less likely* if Jane is guilty of smothering. Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If smothering occurred, one would typically expect to find such signs. Their explicit absence weakens the smothering hypothesis.\n\nGiven that two points are highly consistent with guilt (due to resuscitation), but one critical point (absence of typical smothering signs) significantly weakens the guilt hypothesis, the overall likelihood of observing this specific combination of evidence is diminished. It's not impossible, as smothering doesn't always produce all typical signs, but it makes the specific evidence profile less probable than if typical signs were present.\n\n40",
