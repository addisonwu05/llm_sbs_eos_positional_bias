  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering her children, we need to assess the likelihood of the following observations:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane smothered Ben, the injuries (spinal cord, hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) would have been present when he arrived at the hospital. Nurses, especially in an emergency resuscitation scenario, can miss or not immediately document all injuries, particularly internal ones. This observation is plausible if Jane is guilty.\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are tiny red spots that can be a typical sign of smothering or asphyxia. The absence of petechiae makes the case for smothering less straightforward. However, smothering does not *always* result in petechiae; the occurrence depends on factors like the method, duration, and individual physiological response. Therefore, while less typical, its absence is still possible if Jane is guilty of smothering.\n3.  **Dislocated ribs found in Ben, which \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\":** If Jane smothered Ben, the cause of death would be asphyxia. Injuries like dislocated ribs are commonly caused by vigorous resuscitation efforts in infants or can occur post-mortem. Therefore, these specific injuries being attributed to post-mortem events or resuscitation is entirely consistent with Jane having caused the initial fatal condition (smothering) and subsequent efforts to revive Ben. This observation is highly likely if Jane is guilty.\n4.  **Injuries found in Andy (bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, blood in lung) were \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby\":** Similar to Ben's dislocated ribs, if Jane smothered Andy, the injuries found could plausibly have resulted from resuscitation attempts rather than directly from the act of smothering. This is a common phenomenon in such cases and does not contradict Jane's guilt. This observation is highly likely if Jane is guilty.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe scenario presents a complex forensic picture where some typical signs of smothering are absent (petechiae), and other injuries are explained by non-criminal causes (resuscitation, post-mortem events). If Jane is guilty, it implies that her actions led to the children's deaths, but the resulting physical evidence is either ambiguous or complicated by subsequent medical interventions.\n\n*   The nurses missing injuries and the injuries being explained by resuscitation/post-mortem are quite plausible occurrences in such a tragic event, even if Jane is guilty.\n*   The absence of petechiae is the most significant factor that makes the 'guilty' hypothesis less straightforward. While possible, it's not the most typical outcome of smothering.\n\nConsidering these points, while not impossible, the presence of these particular observations—especially the lack of typical petechiae alongside the ability to explain other injuries by non-criminal means—makes it less likely that the evidence would present in this specific ambiguous way if Jane were guilty, compared to a scenario where clear evidence of smothering was present.\n\n35",
