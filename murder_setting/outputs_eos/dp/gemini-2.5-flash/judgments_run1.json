  "If Jane is GUILTY, this implies she smothered both children. We need to assess the likelihood of the described evidence given this assumption.\n\nLet's break down each piece of evidence:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\"**: This phrasing is interpreted as the injuries were present but *not noted by nurses* at the time of emergency admission. If Jane smothered Ben, he would have sustained injuries (such as to the ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage, and eye haemorrhages). In the chaotic and urgent environment of an emergency, it is quite plausible that these internal or subtle injuries might not be immediately identified by nurses. Therefore, it is **likely** that this would occur if Jane were guilty.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: The text states that petechiae are \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If smothering occurred, the absence of a typical sign makes this particular observation less straightforward. However, \"typical\" does not mean \"universal.\" Medical literature indicates that petechiae are not present in all cases of smothering or asphyxia, and their absence does not definitively rule out smothering. While it makes the evidence less *classically* indicative of smothering, it is still **plausible** to occur even if Jane is guilty.\n\n3.  **\"the dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text provides an alternative explanation for this specific finding, stating they \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would have been made, and such attempts are known to cause injuries like dislocated ribs in infants. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, it is **likely** that the dislocated ribs could be explained this way.\n\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\"**: Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and are \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similar to Ben, if Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have occurred. Thus, it is **likely** that these injuries would be present and attributable to resuscitation efforts even if Jane is guilty.\n\n**Overall Judgment:**\nIf Jane is guilty, the scenario describes a complex case where the evidence is not perfectly clear-cut.\n*   The severe injuries found on Ben (spinal cord, hypoxic brain damage, eye haemorrhages) are consistent with a violent death like smothering.\n*   The fact that nurses might miss some injuries in an emergency is plausible.\n*   The fact that some injuries (dislocated ribs, Andy's injuries) can be explained by resuscitation attempts (which would follow smothering) is also highly plausible.\n*   The main \"atypical\" factor is the absence of petechiae. While petechiae are \"typical,\" their absence does not make smothering impossible. Many real-world cases involving guilty parties present with incomplete or atypical forensic findings.\n\nConsidering that several elements (missed initial observations, resuscitation injuries) are highly plausible given guilt, and the less typical element (absence of petechiae) is still plausible, the overall combination of these facts is reasonably likely to occur if Jane is indeed guilty. The evidence's ambiguity does not necessarily mean it's unlikely to exist if she were guilty; rather, it suggests a challenging case to prove.\n\n65",
