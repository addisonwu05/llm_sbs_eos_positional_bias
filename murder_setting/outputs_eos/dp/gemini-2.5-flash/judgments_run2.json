  "To assess the likelihood of the described evidence if Jane is NOT GUILTY, we evaluate each piece of information under the assumption of her innocence (i.e., the deaths were not caused by her, but by natural causes, SIDS, or medical intervention).\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that any injuries found later were not present when she brought the baby to the hospital, implying they occurred post-arrival (e.g., during medical procedures or examination). This observation is consistent with her innocence.\n\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text notes, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Ben was not smothered by Jane (i.e., Jane is not guilty), then the absence of typical smothering signs like petechiae is exactly what one would expect. This observation strongly supports her innocence regarding smothering.\n\n3.  **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:**\n    *   \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Ben died of natural causes (consistent with Jane being not guilty), then finding a common sign of natural death is highly probable.\n    *   \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If these injuries were not caused by Jane, but rather after death or during resuscitation efforts, this is consistent with her innocence.\n\n4.  **Injuries found in Andy:** \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Andy's death was natural and his injuries were a result of resuscitation efforts (consistent with Jane being not guilty), then observing such injuries and their initial interpretation as due to resuscitation is highly likely.\n\nAll the pieces of evidence listed in the question are accompanied by explanations that make them highly consistent with, or even expected under, the hypothesis that Jane is NOT GUILTY. The question explicitly asks for the likelihood of these specific facts *if* Jane is not guilty. Given that these facts align perfectly with natural death, SIDS, or iatrogenic (medical) causes rather than homicide by Jane, the probability is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of murder by smothering:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane caused significant injuries by smothering Ben, it is less likely that these injuries would go entirely unnoticed by nurses upon his arrival at the hospital. While some internal injuries might be missed, the extent of injuries (ribs, spinal cord, brain hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages) suggests they would be substantial.\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, the absence of such a typical sign makes this finding less likely under the assumption of her guilt.\n3.  **Dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The statement says these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty and caused these rib dislocations during smothering, it is unlikely that experts would attribute them to post-mortem events or resuscitation. This explanation, if accurate, weakens the link to her actions.\n4.  **Injuries found in Andy:** Andy’s injuries \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person.\" If Jane is guilty and caused these injuries by smothering, it is unlikely that they would be so perfectly mimicked by and attributed to resuscitation efforts. This interpretation, again, provides a non-guilty explanation for the observed trauma.\n\nTaken together, these pieces of evidence (the absence of typical smothering signs, the expert opinions attributing injuries to natural causes or medical interventions, and the initial lack of observation of injuries) largely contradict or weaken the case for Jane's guilt by smothering. If Jane *is* guilty, it would be highly unusual to find such a consistent pattern of evidence that points away from her culpability. Therefore, the likelihood of this specific collection of findings existing if Jane is guilty is quite low.\n\n15",
  "To assess the likelihood of the described evidence if Jane is NOT GUILTY, we must consider each piece of information under the assumption that the deaths were natural (e.g., SIDS) or accidental, and not caused by Jane.\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** Both babies died at a similar age (11 weeks vs. 8 weeks), at a similar time of day after being fed, and both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone. While SIDS can recur in families, the precise replication of these circumstances (age, time, Jane's presence alone) for two separate, independent natural deaths is highly coincidental and statistically very improbable. If the deaths were purely natural and unrelated to Jane's actions, such a pattern would be an astonishing series of coincidences.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** If Ben died of natural causes, it is plausible that a severe natural event (e.g., respiratory distress, cardiac event, seizure) could lead to significant hypoxic damage over a period of hours before death. This finding, on its own, does not definitively rule out natural causes.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma:** If Jane is not guilty, then Ben was not smothered by her. While the findings are *consistent* with smothering and/or violent trauma, \"consistent with\" does not mean \"exclusive to.\" However, for these specific injuries to occur from *uncomplicated* natural causes, without any form of violent trauma, is less common. Severe, prolonged natural illnesses or extremely aggressive resuscitation *could* theoretically lead to some of these findings, but the explicit mention of \"violent trauma\" suggests something beyond typical natural death.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering:** This is the most critical piece of evidence against Jane's innocence. If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then these injuries were *not* due to abuse or smothering. However, the expert re-examination explicitly states they are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" For these findings to be present if Jane is innocent would mean that either the expert assessment is fundamentally flawed, or that there's an extremely rare, non-abusive, non-smothering cause that perfectly mimics these severe indicators of abuse and smothering. This is highly improbable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nConsidering all these points together:\n*   The striking similarities between the two deaths are highly unlikely if both were independent natural events.\n*   While the timing of Ben's hypoxic damage could fit natural causes, the overall pattern of injuries in Ben being consistent with \"violent trauma\" is harder to reconcile with simple natural death.\n*   Most importantly, Andy's re-examined injuries being \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" presents a direct and strong contradiction to Jane's innocence. If these expert findings are accurate, it is exceptionally unlikely for them to occur if Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative likelihood of these specific pieces of evidence existing *if* Jane is NOT GUILTY is very low.\n\n10",
