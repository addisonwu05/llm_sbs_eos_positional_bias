  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered both her children. Let's analyze the likelihood of each piece of evidence given this assumption:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:**\n    *   The \"injuries found on Ben\" include \"hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\" These are direct consequences of smothering (asphyxia).\n    *   If Jane smothered Ben, these asphyxial injuries *would have been present* at the time he was brought to the hospital, as they were the cause of his death before or during his collapse.\n    *   Therefore, the statement that these injuries were \"not present\" when he was brought to the hospital is highly unlikely if Jane is guilty. The other injuries (ribs, spinal cord) are explained as likely post-mortem or due to resuscitation, so they *might* not have been present on arrival. However, the asphyxial injuries *must* have been present. The overall statement about \"the injuries found on Ben\" (which includes the asphyxial ones) not being present is thus very unlikely.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:**\n    *   The text states: \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae\".\n    *   While petechiae are often associated with smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out smothering. Not all cases of smothering result in petechiae.\n    *   Therefore, the absence of petechiae is plausible, even if Jane is guilty.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:**\n    *   The text states: \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\"\n    *   If Jane is guilty, resuscitation attempts would have been made. Such injuries are consistent with resuscitation.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly likely that dislocated ribs would be found, even if Jane is guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:**\n    *   Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and are described as \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n    *   If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, resuscitation attempts would have been made.\n    *   Therefore, it is highly likely that these injuries would be found and attributed to resuscitation, even if Jane is guilty.\n\n**Overall Likelihood:**\nThe crucial factor is the first point: the likelihood that the asphyxial injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) were \"not present\" when Ben was brought to the hospital, given that Jane is guilty of smothering him. If Jane is guilty, these injuries *would have been present*. Thus, the statement that they were *not present* is highly contradictory to the assumption of guilt. While the other events are plausible or likely under the guilt hypothesis, this first event significantly reduces the probability of the entire conjunction.\n\nTherefore, the combined likelihood of all these events occurring, given that Jane is GUILTY, is very low.\n\n2",
