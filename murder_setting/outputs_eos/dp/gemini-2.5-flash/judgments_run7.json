  "To determine the likelihood of the described evidence occurring if Jane is NOT GUILTY, we must evaluate each piece of information under the assumption that her children died of natural causes (like SIDS) or due to non-criminal accidents/medical procedures.\n\nHere's an assessment of each point:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\"**: If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would be natural. The text states that \"dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If these injuries occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, they would naturally not have been noted upon arrival. Other injuries, if subtle or internally located, could also be missed by nurses during initial assessment of a dying or deceased infant. This scenario is quite likely under the assumption of innocence.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: The text explicitly states, \"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is not guilty and Ben was not smothered, then the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is *highly expected* and therefore very likely.\n\n3.  **\"the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Both of these findings are explicitly presented as being consistent with, or even common in, a natural death scenario or due to standard medical interventions. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the presence of these findings is very likely.\n\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\"**: The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is not guilty and Andy died of natural causes, it is highly likely that resuscitation attempts would have been made, and these attempts are known to cause such injuries. Therefore, the presence of these injuries is very likely under the assumption of innocence.\n\nIn summary, all the listed observations are explicitly explained in the background information as being highly consistent with, common in, or probably caused by natural death, resuscitation attempts, or post-mortem changes. These explanations directly support the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty. The question asks for the likelihood of these combined observations *given* Jane's innocence. Since each point is individually presented as very likely under the \"not guilty\" hypothesis, the combined probability that these specific observations would be made is also very high.\n\nThe probability that these facts would align as described, given that Jane is not guilty, is high.\n\n90",
  "To determine the likelihood of the described evidence occurring if Jane is GUILTY (i.e., she smothered her children), we must evaluate each piece of information under this assumption:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\"**: If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the injuries (ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) would have been present (or at least initiated) before he arrived at the hospital. However, internal injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages to eyes/eyelids, spinal bleeding) would not typically be noted by nurses during an initial external assessment. Additionally, the text states that \"dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Ben was smothered, resuscitation attempts would certainly follow, meaning these rib injuries could have occurred *after* he was brought to the hospital. Therefore, it is quite plausible that nurses would not have noted the full extent of these injuries upon arrival, even if Jane is guilty.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, then smothering is the cause of death. The text states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If smothering occurred, the *absence* of a typical sign like petechiae makes this observation less likely. While not every smothering case will present with all typical signs, their explicit absence is a notable counter-indicator to the smothering hypothesis. This significantly reduces the probability of observing this specific piece of evidence if Jane is guilty.\n\n3.  **\"the dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would be expected. Therefore, the occurrence of dislocated ribs due to resuscitation attempts is highly consistent with the scenario where Jane is guilty.\n\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\"**: The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would be expected. Therefore, the occurrence of these injuries is highly consistent with the scenario where Jane is guilty.\n\n**Summary of Likelihoods given GUILT:**\n\n*   **Injuries not noted by nurses (Ben):** Moderately likely (internal injuries, or injuries from post-arrival resuscitation).\n*   **Absence of petechiae (Ben):** Low likelihood (as petechiae are described as \"typical\" for smothering, their absence is a counter-indicator).\n*   **Dislocated ribs (Ben):** High likelihood (consistent with resuscitation attempts).\n*   **Injuries in Andy:** High likelihood (consistent with resuscitation attempts).\n\nWhile several pieces of evidence (resuscitation injuries, nurses missing internal injuries) are consistent with Jane being guilty, the explicit absence of \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering, such as petechiae,\" is a significant finding that makes the overall pattern of evidence less likely under the assumption of guilt. The probability is therefore reduced due to this conflicting piece of information.\n\n15",
  "To assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is NOT GUILTY, we assume the deaths were due to natural causes (like SIDS) or non-criminal accidents/medical issues.\n\n1.  **\"the similarities between both incidents are astonishing: both babies were about the same age when they died; they both died at similar time of the day after just being fed; and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\"**: While individual aspects (age range for SIDS, dying after feeding/going to sleep, mother being alone with baby) can occur in natural deaths, the combination of *two* infant deaths in the same family with such \"astonishing\" similarities is statistically very rare for independent natural causes like SIDS. The description \"astonishing\" itself highlights the unusual nature of this pattern if the deaths were truly coincidental and natural. Therefore, observing this pattern of similarities is quite unlikely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n2.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death\"**: SIDS is defined as a sudden and unexplained death. While other natural causes can lead to prolonged hypoxia before death, this specific finding of hypoxic damage occurring \"a matter of hours before death\" is less consistent with a sudden, unexplained death like SIDS, where the terminal event is typically rapid. If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of SIDS, this specific timing is less likely.\n\n3.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\"**: The text states these are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is not guilty, these findings must be explainable by natural causes without violent trauma. While severe natural illness leading to death can sometimes involve hypoxia and, in rare circumstances, produce certain haemorrhages, the explicit statement linking them to \"violent trauma\" suggests they are not typical findings for an ordinary SIDS death or common natural causes. Therefore, observing these specific injuries in Ben is less likely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n4.  **\"the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"**: This is the most critical point. If Jane is not guilty, these injuries must have been caused by something other than abuse or smothering, despite the strong medical interpretation that they are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" A torn frenulum, in particular, is a strong indicator of oral trauma or forced feeding, and for this to occur accidentally in an 11-week-old, alongside other injuries \"indicative of abuse,\" is highly improbable. For all these injuries to be present and accurately described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" yet Jane be innocent, would require either a profound misinterpretation by medical experts or an extraordinary series of coincidental, non-abusive traumas that perfectly mimic abuse. This is extremely unlikely.\n\nConsidering all these points together, especially the strong medical opinion on Andy's injuries and the \"astonishing\" similarities, the likelihood of observing this pattern of evidence if Jane is truly not guilty is very low.\n\n5",
