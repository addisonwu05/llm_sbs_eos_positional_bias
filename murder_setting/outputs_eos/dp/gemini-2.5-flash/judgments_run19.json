  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means the deaths were due to natural causes, SIDS, or complications arising from resuscitation attempts, rather than smothering. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If these injuries occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, they would indeed not have been present when Ben was first brought to the hospital. This explanation makes it highly plausible that at least some of the injuries found on Ben were not present initially.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning Ben was not smothered), then the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is highly expected and consistent with this hypothesis.\n\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Both of these findings are directly explained as being common or probable in a non-criminal death scenario. This makes their occurrence highly likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text mentions that Andy's injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This directly provides a non-criminal explanation for Andy's injuries, making their occurrence highly likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY.\n\nIn summary, all the listed points provide explanations that are either directly stated as common, probable, or consistent with a non-criminal cause of death (natural causes, SIDS, or resuscitation efforts). The absence of typical smothering signs (petechiae) further reinforces the \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis. Therefore, observing this specific combination of evidence is very likely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered both children, and their deaths were not due to natural causes, SIDS, or merely resuscitation complications. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this \"GUILTY\" hypothesis:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane smothered Ben, the critical injuries linked to smothering (e.g., hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and possibly the rib and spinal cord injuries if caused by the act of smothering) would have been inflicted during the smothering event. Therefore, these injuries *would have been present* when he was brought to the hospital, even if \"not noted by nurses.\" The statement that they were \"not noted by nurses\" suggests oversight, not absence. Given this, the likelihood that these injuries were *not* present is very low if Jane is guilty of causing them.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, finding this typical injury would be expected. While it's possible for smothering to occur without petechiae, their absence makes the forensic picture for smothering less straightforward and thus somewhat less likely to be observed if smothering indeed occurred.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, medical personnel would have attempted resuscitation. Therefore, it is highly likely that resuscitation attempts, or post-mortem changes, could cause dislocated ribs, regardless of the initial cause of death. This finding is highly consistent with the \"GUILTY\" hypothesis followed by resuscitation attempts.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similar to Ben, if Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have followed. Therefore, these resuscitation-related injuries are highly likely to be present. This finding is highly consistent with the \"GUILTY\" hypothesis followed by resuscitation attempts.\n\nIn summary, two of the four pieces of evidence (dislocated ribs in Ben and injuries in Andy) are highly consistent with resuscitation efforts that would follow a smothering incident. However, the first point (\"injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\") is highly *inconsistent* with the \"GUILTY\" hypothesis for the primary smothering-related injuries. The second point (absence of petechiae) is also less typical for smothering, making it somewhat less likely under the \"GUILTY\" hypothesis.\n\nThe extremely low likelihood of the first condition (that the smothering-related injuries were *not* present when Ben was brought in) significantly reduces the overall probability of observing this entire set of evidence if Jane is guilty.\n\n1",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, SIDS, or complications arising from resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm by Jane. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis:\n\n1.  **\"The similarities between both incidents are astonishing: both babies were about the same age when they died; they both died at similar time of the day after just being fed; and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\"**\n    *   While \"astonishing\" implies a low probability for random chance, if Jane is NOT GUILTY and both children died from natural causes like SIDS, some similarities might be expected. SIDS commonly occurs in infants within the 2-4 month age range (Andy was 11 weeks, Ben 8 weeks). Infants are often put to bed after feeding, and it's plausible for the primary caregiver (Jane) to be the one to discover an unresponsive baby when alone at home. However, the combined \"astonishing\" nature of these specific similarities, especially the repeated occurrence, is still less probable for random natural deaths, even if individually explainable.\n\n2.  **\"The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death.\"**\n    *   If Ben died naturally (e.g., from a severe illness or SIDS event leading to respiratory/cardiac arrest), it is plausible that a period of oxygen deprivation could have occurred over several hours leading up to death. This finding is consistent with a natural cause of death.\n\n3.  **\"The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"**\n    *   If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these injuries must have arisen from natural causes or resuscitation. While hypoxic damage can result from natural events (like cardiac arrest), haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are often considered strong indicators of non-accidental trauma, such as smothering or strangulation, due to increased venous pressure. For these injuries to occur naturally and *also* be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" when no such trauma occurred, would imply a very rare mimicking event or a misinterpretation of forensic findings. This significantly reduces the likelihood under the \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis.\n\n4.  **\"The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"**\n    *   Previously, these injuries in Andy were noted as \"consistent with attempts to revive a person.\" However, this new information states that they are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then these injuries must have been solely caused by resuscitation attempts (as initially believed) or natural causes. For injuries caused by resuscitation or natural causes to be *accurately described* as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" by forensic experts, implies a fundamental misinterpretation if Jane is truly innocent. The presence of such definitive abuse/smothering indicators, if Jane is not guilty, is highly improbable.\n\nIn summary, while points 1 and 2 could potentially align with natural deaths (albeit point 1 with a degree of rarity), points 3 and 4 present significant challenges to the \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis. The statements that Ben's injuries are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" and Andy's injuries are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" directly contradict the idea of Jane's innocence if these expert assessments are taken as factual. For Jane to be NOT GUILTY, these strong forensic conclusions regarding abuse and smothering would have to be fundamentally mistaken, and the injuries must have arisen from entirely innocent causes that coincidentally mimic abuse. This is a very unlikely scenario.\n\n5",
