  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering both children, we need to evaluate the likelihood of the specific pieces of evidence described:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" Since an autopsy *later found* these injuries (ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage, eye hemorrhages), they *were* present when he was brought in. Therefore, this statement refers to the likelihood that nurses *missed* or *did not note* these injuries upon arrival. If Jane smothered Ben, these injuries would have been present. Given that some were internal (spinal cord, brain hypoxic damage) and initial efforts would be focused on resuscitation, it is plausible, though not certain, that nurses might not have noted all of them immediately.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text notes that \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" Petechiae are often considered a typical sign of smothering or asphyxia. If Jane is guilty of smothering, the absence of this typical sign makes the specific set of evidence less consistent with a straightforward case of smothering. While smothering can occur without petechiae, their absence is a less likely outcome if smothering did occur, compared to a scenario where they are present.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, these specific injuries are not attributed to the smothering itself but to other factors. Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs that can be explained by post-mortem events or resuscitation attempts is entirely consistent with Jane's guilt (i.e., it doesn't contradict it). This finding would be highly likely to be explained in this way even if Jane were guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similar to Ben's dislocated ribs, if Jane is guilty, it's highly plausible that any injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung) could be explained by resuscitation efforts. This finding does not contradict her guilt and is highly likely to be explained as such.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering, the specific evidence described presents a mixed picture:\n*   Points 3 and 4 (Ben's dislocated ribs and Andy's injuries being attributable to resuscitation/post-mortem) are highly consistent with guilt. Their existence and explanation don't rule out smothering and are therefore highly probable given guilt.\n*   Point 1 (nurses not noting Ben's injuries) is moderately likely given guilt, as internal injuries or a chaotic resuscitation scene could lead to them being missed initially.\n*   Point 2 (the absence of petechiae) is the most problematic for the \"guilty\" hypothesis. While not impossible for smothering to occur without petechiae, their absence is less typical and makes this specific set of evidence less likely to arise if Jane is guilty of typical smothering.\n\nConsidering all these factors, particularly the less-than-typical presentation due to the absence of petechiae, the overall likelihood of this specific collection of evidence occurring *given that Jane is guilty* is not very high, but not extremely low either. It represents an ambiguous set of findings for a guilty person.\n\nTherefore, the probability is assessed as being in the lower-to-mid range.\n\n25",
