  "Based on the information provided, it is fairly likely that Jane is not guilty. The absence of typical smothering injuries on Ben, the injuries not being noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, the commonality of spinal bleeding in natural death, and the consistency of Andy's injuries with resuscitation attempts suggest that there may be reasonable doubt in this case.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy would be lower.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the findings of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would be less probable.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20",
