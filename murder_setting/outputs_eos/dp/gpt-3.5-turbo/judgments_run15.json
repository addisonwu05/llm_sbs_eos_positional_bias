  "The likelihood that Jane is NOT GUILTY considering the absence of injuries found on Ben when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of smothering such as petechiae, the common findings of spinal bleeding in natural deaths, and the injuries found on Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is 85.",
