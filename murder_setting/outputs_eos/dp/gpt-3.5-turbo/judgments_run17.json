  "Given the findings that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of smothering such as petechiae, and that the injuries found on Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts, it is likely that Jane is NOT GUILTY. Therefore, I would assign a probability of ***90*** to the likelihood that Jane is not guilty based on the information provided.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found on Ben were likely present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of smothering such as petechiae may have been intentionally concealed or overlooked, the dislocated ribs found in Ben could be a result of the smothering or post-mortem events, and the injuries found in Andy could have been from smothering. Based on this scenario, I would assign a probability of ***75*** to the likelihood that Jane is guilty based on the information provided.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the consistency of the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids with smothering or other violent trauma, as well as the indicative signs of abuse found in Andy's re-examination, would be quite low. Therefore, I would assign a probability of ***20*** to the likelihood of Jane being not guilty based on these factors.",

  "Based on the given evidence, including the injuries found on the children, the circumstances surrounding their deaths, the similarities between the incidents, and the potential signs of abuse and smothering, the probability that the defendant is guilty is ***80***.",
  "Guilty."
