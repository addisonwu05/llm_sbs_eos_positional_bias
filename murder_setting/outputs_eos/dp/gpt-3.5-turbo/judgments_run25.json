  "Based on the information provided, considering the absence of typical injuries of smothering on Ben, the fact that the injuries found may have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, the initial misinterpretation of Andy's injuries, and the possibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a potential explanation, it is ***unlikely*** (probability judgment: 15) that Jane is guilty of smothering both children.",
  "If Jane is guilty, considering the injuries found on Ben, the absence of typical injuries of smothering, the presence of dislocated ribs in Ben, and the previously overlooked injuries on Andy, it would be ***very unlikely*** (probability judgment: 5) that these factors do not point towards Jane's guilt.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, considering the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the consistency of injuries with abuse and smothering, it would be ***unlikely*** (probability judgment: 20) for all these aspects to align without Jane's guilt.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, considering the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the consistency of injuries with abuse and smothering, it would be ***highly likely*** (probability judgment: 90) for all these aspects to be present due to Jane's guilt.",
  "Based on the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant is guilty appears to be ***60***.",
  "Guilty."
