  "Given the information provided that suggests the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of a death due to smothering in Ben, the common nature of spinal bleeding in natural death, and the consistency of Andy's injuries with resuscitation attempts, the probability that Jane is NOT GUILTY is approximately 80 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is approximately 20 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is approximately 10 out of 100.",
