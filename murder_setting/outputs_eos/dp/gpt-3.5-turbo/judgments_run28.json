Considering all these factors, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and the absence of typical injuries of smothering, is 90%. \n\n100",

  "In the scenario where Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy not being indicative of abuse or smothering is 10%.\n\n100",
