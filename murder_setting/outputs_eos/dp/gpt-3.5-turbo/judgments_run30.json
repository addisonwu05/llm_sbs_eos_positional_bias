  "Based on the information provided, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, considering the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the presence of spinal bleeding which is a common finding in natural death, the possibility of dislocated ribs occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, and the initial misinterpretation of Andy's injuries as being due to resuscitation attempts rather than smothering, the probability that Jane is not guilty is 80.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, considering the injuries found on Ben, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of dislocated ribs in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy that were suggestive of smothering, the likelihood that Jane is guilty is 95.",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, considering the similarities between both incidents, the likelihood that these similarities would occur coincidentally is 5.",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, considering the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused shortly before death, and the presence of consistent injuries in both Andy and Ben indicative of abuse and smothering, the likelihood of these similarities occurring is 90.",
  "Considering the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant is guilty is 95.",
