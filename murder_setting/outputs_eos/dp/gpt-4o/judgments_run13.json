  "Given the context provided, assessing the likelihood of various medical findings and injuries can be complex, and it involves significant uncertainty due to the factors mentioned. Considering the plausible explanations provided, such as the possibility of resuscitation-related injuries and natural causes, a precise numerical probability will inherently involve some degree of speculation.\n\nHowever, to align with your request for a probability judgment as an integer between 0 and 100, let's assume the following:\n\n- The injuries found on Ben could potentially have been caused by resuscitation efforts or post-mortem changes.\n- The absence of petechiae suggests that smothering may not have been the cause of death.\n- The injuries on Andy that were initially attributed to resuscitation might legitimately have been caused by such efforts, keeping in mind the complexity of resuscitating infants.\n- SIDS, while rare, remains a potential explanation for the deaths.\n\nGiven these considerations and the variability in forensic and medical interpretations, the probability judgment reflecting whether Jane is NOT GUILTY, considering the specific factors you asked about, would be an estimate. Therefore, acknowledging the substantial uncertainty and varying interpretations present in this scenario:\n\n**50**",
  "**30**",
  "**20**",
  "**75**",
  "**70**",
  "Guilty"
