  "Given the information provided, the presence of injuries on both children can be viewed in different lights, considering both medical explanations and the context of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Since the injuries might be attributable to resuscitation efforts and the absence of typical signs of smothering were noted, it cannot be conclusively stated that the injuries were due to foul play.\n\nWith that in mind, the probability judgment regarding the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital and the injuries being consistent with resuscitation or other natural causes, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, would be determined more by clinical judgment than by certainty. It is a complex assessment requiring expert investigation into medical records, autopsy reports, and witness accounts.\n\nHowever, based on available details that allow for a range of interpretations, I make a probability judgment: **70**.",
