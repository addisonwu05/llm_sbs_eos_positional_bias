  "Considering the information provided, injuries found in both babies could be attributed to resuscitation efforts rather than intentional harm. The possibility that these injuries occurred after Ben was transported to the hospital, along with the natural causes that might account for the findings in Andy, suggests a non-negligible chance of innocence. Taking into account the absence of definitive injuries often linked with smothering and looking at the possibility of natural causes or unfortunate coincidences like SIDS, there remains room for reasonable doubt regarding Jane's guilt.
