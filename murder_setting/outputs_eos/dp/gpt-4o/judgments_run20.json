  "Given the information provided:\n\n- The absence of petechiae, which are typically associated with smothering, suggests a lower likelihood of smothering as the cause.\n- Spinal bleeding found in Ben is noted as a common finding in natural death scenarios.\n- Dislocated ribs could have been caused by resuscitation attempts, not necessarily indicative of smothering.\n- The injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and are consistent with attempts to revive a baby.\n- If Ben's injuries were not noted by nurses, this could mean they were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital or not immediately recognized.\n\nWithout forensic evidence that conclusively proves smothering, and considering the possibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the probability that the injuries were not consistent with inflicted harm if Jane is indeed NOT GUILTY seems reasonable to consider. Therefore, the probability that these injuries are not necessarily indicative of murder is high.\n\nBased on this analysis, the probability judgment is: \n\n80",
  "20",
