  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence presented suggests that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a natural and unexplained cause of death in infants.\n\nThe key factors that support this likelihood are:\n- The initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes of death.\n- The injuries found on Ben, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, are commonly associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than smothering.\n- The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case.\n- The injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\n- The nurses did not note the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital, suggesting they may have developed later or were not present at that time.\n- SIDS is a recognized and relatively common phenomenon, occurring in 1 in 4,000 cases in the UK, and is more common among boys than girls.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy.\n\nThe key factors that support this low likelihood are:\n\n- The autopsy findings on Ben, including injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are more consistent with smothering than natural causes.\n- The additional tests on Andy's autopsy photographs that revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung further suggest a pattern of abuse or intentional harm.\n- The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, does not necessarily rule out smothering as a cause of death, as these injuries can be difficult to detect or may not always be present.\n- The dislocated ribs found in Ben could have resulted from the smothering itself or from attempted resuscitation, and are not necessarily inconsistent with a smothering death.\n- The nurses' failure to note the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital does not mean the injuries were not present, as they may have been overlooked or developed later.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.\n\nThe key factors that support this low likelihood are:\n\n- The similarities in the timing and circumstances of the two deaths are highly suspicious and suggest a pattern of abuse rather than natural causes.\n- The specific injuries found in both cases, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and hypoxic brain damage, are strongly indicative of smothering or other forms of intentional harm.\n- The medical evidence that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have occurred just prior to his death further points to an intentional act rather than natural causes.\n- The combination of these factors, along with the lack of clear alternative explanations, makes it highly improbable that Jane is not guilty if these similarities and medical findings are present.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is:\n\n20%",
