  "Based on the information provided, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries like petechiae in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, suggests that Jane is likely not guilty. The evidence points towards these injuries being the result of natural causes or resuscitation efforts, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, the common occurrence of the findings in Ben's case, and the plausible explanation for Andy's injuries all contribute to a high likelihood that Jane is not guilty.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries like petechiae in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, is relatively low.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, and the plausible explanations for the other findings, suggest that it is unlikely these factors would be present if Jane were guilty of intentionally smothering her children.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is low:\n- The similarities between both incidents (babies dying at similar ages and times of day)\n- The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused just hours before death\n- The hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben being consistent with smothering\n- The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse\n\nThe evidence you've provided suggests a strong pattern of abuse and smothering, which would be highly unlikely if Jane were not guilty. The similarities between the two incidents, and the medical evidence, point towards Jane being responsible.\n\n20%",
