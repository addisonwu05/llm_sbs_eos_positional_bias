  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, is high.\n\nThe absence of clear signs of smothering, the presence of injuries that can be explained by natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and the lack of observation of these injuries by the medical staff at the hospital, suggest that the evidence against Jane is not conclusive, and that it is possible the deaths of the two children were due to natural causes, such as SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, is low.\n\nThe lack of clear signs of smothering on the victims, such as petechiae, would be unexpected if Jane had indeed smothered the children. The presence of injuries that can be explained by natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and the lack of observation of these injuries by the medical staff, suggests that the evidence against Jane is not as strong as it may initially appear.\n\nHowever, given the overall circumstances of the case, including the two unexplained infant deaths in the family, the probability that Jane is guilty is higher than if she were innocent.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability that there would be these striking similarities between the two incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy, is very low.\n\nThe combination of these factors, which are all consistent with smothering or other forms of abuse, would be highly unlikely to occur by chance, especially given the similarities between the two incidents. The medical evidence strongly points to intentional harm rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the additional information provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",

  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n80%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
