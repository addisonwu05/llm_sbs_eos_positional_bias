  "If the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of a death due to smothering such as petechiae in Ben, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben as well as the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, then it is highly likely that Jane is not guilty of the two counts of murder.\n\nThe presence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a possible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben, along with the lack of clear evidence of smothering or other forms of intentional harm, suggests that the charges against Jane may be unfounded.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty is 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively low.\n\nGiven the nature of the case and the evidence presented, the likelihood of these factors being true if Jane is guilty is 20%.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following factors is relatively low:\n\n1) The similarities between both incidents (babies of similar age, died at similar time of day after being fed, found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them)\n2) The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death\n3) The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\n4) The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy\n\nGiven the evidence presented, the probability that these factors would exist if Jane is not guilty is 30%.\n\n30",
