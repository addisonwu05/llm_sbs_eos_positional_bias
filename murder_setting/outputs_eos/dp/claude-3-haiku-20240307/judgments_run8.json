  "Based on the information provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty of murdering her children is relatively high. The key evidence that supports this conclusion includes:\n\n1. The initial autopsy of the first child, Andy, suggested natural causes of death.\n2. The injuries found on the second child, Ben, were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, indicating they may have occurred later or were not as severe as reported.\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are common findings in natural deaths and can occur during resuscitation attempts.\n4. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, further suggests the deaths may have been due to natural causes.\n5. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a recognized phenomenon that accounts for a significant number of unexplained infant deaths, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that Jane is not guilty of murdering her children is **80%**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is **20%**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability that there are these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is **20%**.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability that there are these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is **80%**.",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is **70%**.",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 70% that the defendant, Jane, is guilty, my verdict is **GUILTY**."
