  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy are consistent with the evidence.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, and the presence of injuries that are more consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, suggests that the deaths of the two children may have been due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rather than intentional smothering.\n\nThe fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital further supports the idea that the injuries may have occurred later or were not present at the time.\n\nThe spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are also common findings in natural deaths and may have occurred during resuscitation attempts.\n\nSimilarly, the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts, which is consistent with the evidence.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries, and the injuries found in both children being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is low.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of smothering her children, it is unlikely that the injuries on Ben would have been missed by the hospital staff, and the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, would be unexpected.\n\nThe dislocated ribs found in Ben could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, but the lack of other typical smothering injuries would be unusual if Jane were guilty.\n\nSimilarly, the injuries found in Andy being attributed to the resuscitation attempts would be less likely if Jane were guilty, as the initial autopsy suggested natural causes of death.\n\nGiven this information, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries, and the injuries found in both children being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is quite low.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies, the time of day, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious, could be coincidental or may suggest an underlying medical condition or environmental factor that contributed to their deaths.\n\nHowever, the specific injuries found, such as the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, are more indicative of intentional harm or smothering, rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nThe doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death also suggests a more acute, rather than natural, cause of death.\n\nGiven this additional information, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these specific similarities and injuries being present is only 20%.\n\n20%",
