  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence seems to suggest that the deaths of both children could be explained by sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a common and unexplained cause of death in infants.\n\nThe fact that the initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, suggests that the injuries may have occurred later or were not present at the time. Additionally, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben are common findings in natural deaths, and the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, further supports the SIDS hypothesis.\n\nGiven the context and the evidence presented, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on the children were not present when they were brought to the hospital, and that their deaths were due to SIDS, is 90%.\n\n90%",

The evidence suggests that Jane may have intentionally smothered both of her children, and the lack of typical smothering injuries does not necessarily mean that the children were not killed in this manner.\n\nThe fact that the initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes, and the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses, could be explained by a lack of proper medical examination or an intentional attempt to cover up the true cause of death. Additionally, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben, while common in natural deaths, could also be consistent with smothering or other forms of physical abuse.\n\nGiven the context and the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on the children were not present when they were brought to the hospital, and that their deaths were not due to smothering, is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, the specific timing and nature of the injuries, and the consistency with smothering and abuse, strongly suggest that the deaths of both children were not due to natural causes or SIDS. The evidence seems to point towards a pattern of intentional harm and a common cause of death, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance if Jane is not guilty.\n\nGiven the context and the evidence presented, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and the nature of the injuries is 10%.\n\n10%",
