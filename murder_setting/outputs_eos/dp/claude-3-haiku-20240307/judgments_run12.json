  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy being attributable to resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the deaths of Andy and Ben could potentially be explained by sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life. The lack of typical smothering injuries, the presence of injuries that can be attributed to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and the fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital all point towards the possibility of SIDS being the cause of death.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the evidence is consistent with SIDS is 85%.\n\n85%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being attributable to resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the deaths of Andy and Ben were likely caused by intentional smothering or suffocation by Jane. The presence of injuries that are consistent with smothering, such as the brain hypoxia and hemorrhages in Ben's eyes and eyelids, as well as the subsequent findings of injuries in Andy's autopsy, point towards a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nThe lack of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben's case could be explained by the possibility that the smothering was not prolonged enough to cause such injuries, or that other factors masked their appearance. The dislocated ribs in Ben's case and the injuries found in Andy's autopsy could potentially be attributed to resuscitation attempts, but this seems less likely given the other evidence of intentional harm.\n\nOverall, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the evidence is consistent with her intentionally smothering or suffocating her children is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is relatively low:\n\n1. The similarities between both incidents, with both babies being about the same age and dying at similar times of day after being fed, and both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\n2. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death.\n\n3. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma.\n\n4. The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\n\nThe coincidence of these similarities and medical findings across both cases would be highly unlikely if the deaths were due to natural causes or SIDS. The evidence strongly points towards intentional harm, rather than a series of unfortunate and highly improbable natural deaths.\n\nGiven the strength of this evidence, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of all these factors lining up is only 15%.\n\n15%",
