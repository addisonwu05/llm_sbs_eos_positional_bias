  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence suggests that these injuries could be attributed to natural causes, resuscitation attempts, or postmortem changes, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS in the UK is 1 in 4,000, which is a relatively high rate. The fact that both babies were boys also increases the likelihood of SIDS, as it is more common among boys.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, further suggests that the deaths of Andy and Ben may have been due to natural causes or SIDS, rather than intentional actions.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the evidence can be explained by natural causes or other non-intentional factors is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence suggests that these injuries are more consistent with intentional smothering rather than natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe presence of injuries on both babies, such as bruises, torn frenulum, and internal injuries, indicates a pattern of abuse rather than isolated incidents. The lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, does not necessarily rule out smothering, as the absence of such injuries is not uncommon in some cases.\n\nAdditionally, the dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding found in Ben can be consistent with intentional force applied during smothering, rather than solely from resuscitation attempts or natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the evidence can be explained by intentional actions rather than natural causes or other non-intentional factors is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, the timing and nature of the injuries, and the medical findings are highly suggestive of intentional smothering rather than natural causes or accidental deaths.\n\nThe hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, which was allegedly caused a matter of hours before death, is particularly concerning and points towards a non-natural cause of death.\n\nThe presence of bruises, torn frenulum, and internal injuries in both babies is also characteristic of abusive behavior and smothering, rather than what would be expected from natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these factors can be explained by natural causes or other non-intentional factors is:\n\n20%",

  "Based on the given evidence, the probability that the defendant (Jane) is guilty is:\n\n75%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant (Jane) is:\n\nGuilty"
