Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Injuries on Ben not being noted by nurses initially:\n   - This could be explained by injuries being subtle or developing more visibly after death\n   - Hospital staff might miss certain injuries during emergency resuscitation efforts\n\n2. Absence of petechiae in Ben:\n   - This is somewhat inconsistent with smothering, as petechiae are often present\n   - However, not all smothering cases display petechiae, so their absence doesn't rule out homicide\n\n3. Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben:\n   - These could potentially be caused by forceful smothering\n   - Though they could also be from resuscitation, their presence aligns with potential trauma\n\n4. Injuries found in Andy:\n   - Bruises on arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are consistent with trauma\n   - These injuries are more difficult to explain as just resuscitation artifacts\n\nThe pattern of two infants in the same family dying with suspicious injuries is significant. However, some of the specific medical evidence (especially the lack of petechiae and the uncertainty about when injuries appeared) creates some inconsistency with the guilt hypothesis.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
