Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This is consistent with innocence.\n\n3) Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben: If these are indeed common in natural deaths or from resuscitation attempts as suggested, they wouldn't necessarily indicate homicide.\n\n4) Injuries found in Andy: If these injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts, they wouldn't necessarily indicate foul play.\n\nThe overall scenario presents some consistency with natural causes or SIDS, especially given that:\n- Andy's initial autopsy suggested natural causes\n- The injuries found could be explained by resuscitation attempts\n- Certain typical signs of smothering were absent\n- SIDS is a known phenomenon, though rare\n\nTaking all these factors into account, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings would occur as described is approximately 65."

Significant injuries from a deliberate smothering would likely be noticed during medical examination, though some internal injuries might be missed initially.\n\n2) Absence of petechiae in Ben: This is problematic for a guilty scenario, as petechiae are typically present in smothering cases. Their absence makes a smothering less likely.\n\n3) Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben: While these could occur during deliberate suffocation (from restraint or pressure), the fact that they're also consistent with resuscitation attempts makes them less definitively indicative of guilt.\n\n4) Injuries found in Andy: If Jane is guilty, the injuries found retrospectively (bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, blood in lung) would be consistent with a pattern of abuse or smothering, though they were initially missed.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, there are several findings that don't align perfectly with typical smothering cases, particularly the absence of petechiae and the initial missed diagnosis of Andy's death.

The medical evidence pointing to smothering is substantial, especially upon re-examination. The statistical improbability of two natural SIDS deaths in the same family further strengthens the case for guilt.\n\nWeighing all evidence presented, I assess the probability of guilt at 85."
