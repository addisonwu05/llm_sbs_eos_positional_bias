  "Looking at this case from the perspective that Jane is not guilty, I need to assess how likely the observed evidence would be under this hypothesis.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then both deaths would be from natural causes (likely SIDS) rather than smothering. Let me evaluate each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Injuries not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to hospital**: If Jane didn't cause harm, this is very likely - nurses wouldn't note injuries that weren't there initially.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This strongly supports innocence, as petechiae are common indicators of smothering. Their absence is highly consistent with natural death.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: The case explicitly states this is \"a common finding in natural death,\" making it very likely under the innocent hypothesis.\n\n4. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: These are described as \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which is entirely consistent with natural death followed by revival efforts.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: These were \"initially put down as due to resuscitation attempts\" and are described as \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This explanation remains plausible under the innocent hypothesis.\n\nAll the physical evidence has alternative explanations that are consistent with natural deaths and subsequent medical intervention. The medical findings that initially seemed suspicious have been contextualized as either common in natural death or likely due to resuscitation efforts.\n\nThe main factor working against the innocent hypothesis is the statistical improbability of two SIDS deaths in one family (roughly 1 in 16 million), but this doesn't change the likelihood of the specific injury patterns observed.\n\n**85**",
  "Looking at this case from the perspective that Jane is guilty of murdering both children by smothering, I need to assess how likely the observed evidence would be under this hypothesis.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering both children, let me evaluate each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Injuries not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to hospital**: If Jane caused fatal injuries through smothering, it would be somewhat unusual for nurses to miss all signs of trauma, especially if the injuries were severe enough to cause death. However, some injuries from smothering might not be immediately obvious.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This is problematic for the guilty hypothesis. Petechiae are common indicators of smothering/suffocation. Their complete absence makes smothering less likely, though not impossible as smothering doesn't always produce petechiae.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If Jane smothered Ben, chest injuries could result from the force applied. However, the case notes these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which provides an alternative explanation even under the guilty hypothesis.\n\n4. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: While this could potentially result from violent smothering, the case states this is \"common in natural death,\" making it less specifically indicative of murder.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: The torn frenulum and other injuries could be consistent with smothering, but they were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which remains a plausible explanation even if Jane is guilty.\n\nThe key issue is that if Jane violently smothered both children, we would expect more definitive evidence of smothering (like petechiae) and clearer signs that couldn't be explained by resuscitation efforts.\n\n**25**",
  "Looking at this case from the perspective that Jane is not guilty, I need to assess how likely this additional evidence would be under the innocent hypothesis.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty and both deaths were natural (SIDS), let me evaluate this evidence:\n\n1. **Similarities between incidents**: While some similarities could occur naturally (babies of similar age, feeding times, Jane being present as primary caregiver), the specific combination of factors is much less likely under natural causes.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death**: If this was natural SIDS, brain damage typically occurs at or very near the time of death, not hours beforehand. This timing is highly unusual for natural infant death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: While these can occasionally occur in natural death, they are much more characteristic of smothering or violent trauma than SIDS.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries upon re-examination**: The bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs being \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" makes it very unlikely these would all be present in a natural death, even accounting for resuscitation attempts.\n\n5. **Pattern consistency**: The fact that both children show signs \"characteristic of smothering\" makes coincidental natural death extremely improbable.\n\nThe combination of specific injury patterns consistent with abuse, the unusual timing of brain damage, and the remarkable similarities between both incidents would be extraordinarily unlikely if both deaths were natural.\n\n**5**",
  "Looking at this case from the perspective that Jane is guilty of murdering both children by smothering, I need to assess how likely this evidence would be under this hypothesis.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering both children, let me evaluate this evidence:\n\n1. **Similarities between both incidents**: If Jane committed both murders, these similarities would be highly expected - same perpetrator using same method would naturally create similar circumstances (similar ages, timing after feeding, Jane being alone with victims).\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death**: If Jane smothered Ben but he survived the initial attack and lingered before dying, this timing pattern would be entirely consistent with deliberate suffocation followed by a period before death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: These are described as \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane smothered Ben, these findings would be highly expected.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries upon re-examination**: The bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs being \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" would be exactly what we'd expect if Jane smothered Andy.\n\n5. **Pattern consistency**: If Jane is the perpetrator, having both children show signs \"characteristic of smothering\" would be the natural result of her using the same method twice.\n\nAll of this evidence aligns perfectly with the guilty hypothesis. The injuries are exactly what medical experts would expect from smothering, the timing fits deliberate harm, and the similarities reflect consistent perpetrator behavior.\n\n**95**",
  "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively:\n\n**Evidence strongly supporting guilt:**\n- Both children show injuries \"characteristic of smothering\" and \"indicative of abuse\"\n- Hypoxic brain damage in Ben occurred hours before death (highly unusual for natural causes)\n- Eye/eyelid hemorrhages consistent with violent trauma\n- Remarkable similarities between incidents (same ages, timing, circumstances, Jane alone)\n- Pattern of injuries across both children matches deliberate harm\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n- Initial autopsy of Andy suggested natural causes\n- Some injuries could be from resuscitation attempts\n- Absence of petechiae in Ben\n- SIDS does occur naturally, though rarely\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- The likelihood analysis shows the evidence is much more probable under the guilty hypothesis (95%) than innocent (5%)\n- Medical experts specifically describe the injuries as \"characteristic of smothering\" and \"indicative of abuse\"\n- The timing of Ben's brain damage is particularly damaging to the innocent explanation\n- While two SIDS deaths are statistically unlikely, the specific injury patterns go well beyond statistical improbability\n\nThe medical evidence showing injuries characteristic of smothering in both children, combined with the suspicious circumstances and timing, creates a compelling case. While some individual pieces of evidence have alternative explanations, the overall pattern strongly points toward deliberate harm rather than natural causes.\n\n**85**",
