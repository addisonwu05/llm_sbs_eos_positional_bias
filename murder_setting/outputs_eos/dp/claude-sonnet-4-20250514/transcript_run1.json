Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The absence of nurse documentation suggests injuries may have occurred later during medical intervention.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: Petechiae are commonly associated with smothering/asphyxiation. Their absence is more consistent with natural death than intentional smothering.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben**: The case notes these are common findings in natural death and can occur post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts. This makes them quite consistent with innocent explanations.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries**: Initially attributed to resuscitation attempts by medical professionals, and the case confirms such injuries are consistent with revival efforts on infants.\n\nAdditional supporting factors for innocence:\n- SIDS affects 1 in 4,000 infants and is more common in boys (both victims were male)\n- Andy's initial post-mortem suggested natural causes\n- The re-examination of Andy's case only occurred after Ben's death, suggesting potential confirmation bias\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, all the physical evidence has plausible alternative explanations related to natural death, post-mortem changes, and medical intervention attempts. The absence of typical smothering indicators and the initial medical assessment of natural causes further support this likelihood.\n\n85"

However, fresh injuries from smothering would typically be observable upon arrival. This absence is somewhat inconsistent with guilt but not impossible.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This is problematic for the guilt hypothesis. Petechiae are common indicators of asphyxiation/smothering. Their absence makes the smothering theory less supported by typical forensic evidence.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If Jane used force during smothering, rib injuries could occur. However, the case notes these likely occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, which doesn't strongly support intentional harm.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries**: If Jane smothered Andy, the injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts could be coincidental - the injuries might have been from both smothering AND resuscitation efforts.\n\nFactors supporting guilt despite the evidence:\n- Two infant deaths in the same family is statistically very rare\n- Ben did show hypoxic brain damage and various injuries\n- Re-examination revealed injuries in Andy that weren't initially detected\n\nHowever, if Jane were guilty of smothering, we would expect:\n- More typical signs of asphyxiation (like petechiae)\n- Injuries visible to hospital staff upon arrival\n- More consistent patterns of trauma\n\nThe evidence pattern is not what would typically be expected if Jane deliberately smothered both children.\n\n25"

While these similarities could occur naturally, the precise pattern is quite specific and would be less likely under innocent circumstances.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death**: If this was SIDS or natural death, brain damage typically occurs at or very near the time of death, not hours before. This timing is much more consistent with intentional harm than natural infant death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: While these could theoretically occur in natural death, the combination and pattern described are more characteristic of traumatic asphyxiation than SIDS.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries upon re-examination**: Bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Jane is innocent, these would need alternative explanations, but torn frenulum especially is difficult to explain through resuscitation alone.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, we would need:\n- Remarkable coincidence in the timing and circumstances of both deaths\n- Natural processes or medical intervention to explain injuries typically associated with abuse\n- SIDS or other natural causes to produce patterns that medical experts describe as characteristic of smothering\n\nThe probability of all these factors occurring innocently, particularly the specific injury patterns and timing of brain damage, is very low.\n\n15"

This repetitive pattern is very consistent with intentional acts by the same person.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death**: If Jane smothered Ben, this timing makes perfect sense - the initial attack caused brain damage, but Ben survived for hours before ultimately dying. This is exactly what would be expected if someone attempted smothering that initially appeared successful but the child lingered before death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: These are described as consistent with smothering and violent trauma. If Jane is guilty, these injuries directly support the method of killing and would be expected evidence.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lungs)**: If Jane smothered Andy, these injuries described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" would be the direct result of her actions. The torn frenulum particularly suggests forceful contact with the mouth/face area consistent with smothering.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, all the evidence aligns perfectly:\n- Behavioral patterns showing repeated opportunity and method\n- Medical evidence showing the exact injury patterns expected from smothering\n- Timing of brain damage consistent with attempted murder\n- Physical injuries characteristic of the alleged crime\n\nThis evidence pattern is highly consistent with guilt.\n\n88"
