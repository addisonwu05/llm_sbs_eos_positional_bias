Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Hospital documentation isn't always complete in crisis situations.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This actually supports innocence, as petechiae are common indicators of smothering/asphyxiation.

Petechiae are common indicators of asphyxiation/smothering. Their absence makes it less likely that smothering occurred, though not impossible as some smothering cases don't show petechiae.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If Jane smothered Ben, chest compression during the act could cause rib injuries that might later be attributed to resuscitation attempts. This could plausibly mask evidence of the crime.\n\n4. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: While stated to be common in natural death, it could also result from violent handling during smothering, making it consistent with guilt.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: If Jane smothered Andy, the injuries being initially attributed to resuscitation would be convenient cover, masking evidence of the actual cause.\n\nHowever, several factors make the evidence less consistent with guilt:\n- The absence of typical smothering indicators (petechiae)\n- Medical professionals' initial assessments pointing to natural causes\n- The fact that many injuries have plausible innocent explanations that were accepted by medical experts initially\n\nThe evidence pattern shows some consistency with guilt but has notable gaps in typical homicidal indicators.\n\n**40**"

SIDS typically involves sudden death, not prolonged oxygen deprivation hours beforehand that somehow goes unnoticed.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: While some bleeding can occur naturally, the combination with brain hypoxia is much more consistent with trauma than natural death.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries upon re-examination**: Bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs - these are quite specific indicators of abuse/smothering that are difficult to attribute to resuscitation alone, especially the torn frenulum which suggests forced feeding/smothering actions.\n\nThe cumulative effect is particularly damaging to innocence:\n- Two deaths with nearly identical circumstances \n- Both showing signs consistent with smothering upon closer examination\n- Medical evidence suggesting prolonged oxygen deprivation before death\n- Specific injury patterns characteristic of abuse\n\nFor all this evidence to occur naturally would require an extraordinary series of coincidences and misinterpretations by medical experts.\n\n**15**"

She would likely use similar methods, timing (when alone), and circumstances (after feeding when babies are vulnerable/sleepy). This pattern is very consistent with deliberate acts by the same person.\n\n2. **Hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before Ben's death**: If Jane smothered Ben, this fits perfectly. Smothering can cause prolonged oxygen deprivation that leads to brain damage before eventual death. The timing suggests a sustained attack or multiple episodes, which is consistent with intentional suffocation.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: These are classic indicators of asphyxiation/smothering. If Jane smothered Ben, these injuries would be expected consequences of the method used.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries upon re-examination**: The bruises to arms/legs (restraint marks), torn frenulum (forced obstruction of breathing/feeding), and blood in lungs (from suffocation) are textbook signs of smothering abuse. If Jane killed Andy by smothering, these specific injuries would be highly likely outcomes.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, this evidence pattern is not just consistent - it's almost exactly what would be expected from someone who smothered two infants using similar methods. The medical evidence aligns precisely with the alleged crime method.\n\n**92**"
