  "The likelihood of all those factors aligning if Jane is innocent is very low. While SIDS exists, the combination of:\n\n1.  **Similarities in incidents:** Babies same age, time of day, Jane being alone.\n2.  **Recent hypoxic damage to Ben's brain:** Suggests a very recent event before death.\n3.  **Hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben:** Strongly suggests trauma, not just SIDS.\n4.  **Bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in Andy:** These findings after re-examination point towards abuse, not SIDS.\n\nSIDS is usually a \"clean\" death, lacking the injuries found in the autopsies. It's very improbable for SIDS to present with such signs of physical trauma in *both* cases and under such similar circumstances. Two occurrences of SIDS happening in one family is already statistically rare. For them to happen with signs of injury is significantly less probable. The hypoxic damage being recent further lowers the probability if she is innocent.\n\n5\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these factors aligning is very high. A perpetrator often repeats patterns of behavior. The similarities in the incidents (age, time, Jane alone), along with the injuries indicative of abuse, directly support the guilt scenario. A guilty person would likely repeat the method of killing or abuse, leading to the observed similarities and injuries.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries on Andy and Ben are explained by other factors. Therefore, a higher probability is appropriate.\n\n*   **Injuries not present at the hospital:** This is possible, injuries may not have been immediately visible, or the focus was on resuscitation.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** Smothering doesn't *always* present with petechiae, and SIDS doesn't either.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** As stated, spinal bleeding can occur in natural death, and dislocated ribs could occur post-mortem or during resuscitation.\n\n*   **Andy's injuries:** Resuscitation can cause injuries, even if SIDS was the primary cause.\n\nGiven these alternative explanations, there is a substantial likelihood that these factors could align if Jane is innocent.\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these factors aligning is still fairly high, but slightly less than if she were innocent, because the inconsistencies could raise suspicion and potentially lead to her detection. However, the injuries still align with a crime that's meant to appear as a natural death.\n\n*   **Injuries not present at hospital:** Jane could have inflicted subtle injuries not immediately apparent. She has motive to avoid detection, therefore injuries are not immediately visible.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** Smothering doesn't always cause petechiae, and the absence helps mask the crime.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** These injuries may have been due to Jane's actions, but framed as natural/resuscitation effects.\n\n*   **Injuries found in Andy:** Can be presented as the resuscitation attempts.\n\nTherefore, a scenario where these facts are true remains quite probable even if she is guilty because the facts align to mask the crime and lead investigators away from abuse.\n\n70\n",
  "Given the provided information, particularly the similarities in circumstances surrounding the deaths, the injuries sustained by both children, and the relatively low probability of SIDS occurring twice in the same family with physical trauma, the probability of Jane being guilty is substantial.\n\n75\n",
  "Based on the evidence, the verdict is: Guilty.\n"
