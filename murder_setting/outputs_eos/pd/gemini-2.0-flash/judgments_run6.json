  "If Jane is not guilty, attributing the deaths to SIDS or other natural causes, the likelihood of *all* those specific details coinciding by chance is extremely low. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Similarities in incidents:** The babies being of similar age, dying at similar times after feeding, and Jane being the sole caregiver present each time, are individually somewhat probable occurrences within a family. However, the combination drastically reduces the likelihood.\n\n*   **Hypoxic damage to Ben:** Hypoxic damage is possible in SIDS, but the doctor's assertion that it occurred \"a matter of hours\" before death makes it a less typical SIDS presentation.\n\n*   **Hemorrhages in Ben:** Hemorrhages are not typically associated with SIDS.\n\n*   **Injuries to Andy:** Bruises, torn frenulum, and lung blood are not consistent with SIDS, making them highly improbable within that context.\n\nTherefore, the probability of all these factors arising coincidentally without foul play would be very small.\n\n1\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the observed similarities and injuries become significantly more probable. A perpetrator often employs similar methods across multiple instances. The injuries, while not always identical, reflect a pattern of inflicted harm. The timing of the deaths and Jane's presence align with the opportunity for her actions.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the deaths are due to natural causes or other circumstances besides murder, let's consider the likelihood of these findings:\n\n*   **Injuries not noted at hospital:** It's plausible that some subtle injuries, especially in a distressed situation, might be missed by initial hospital staff.\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** Petechiae are not always present in cases of infant death, even those involving asphyxia. Their absence doesn't rule out natural causes or accidental injury.\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** If these occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation, their presence in a natural death scenario is reasonable.\n*   **Andy's injuries explained by resuscitation:** If initially attributed to resuscitation, and consistent with those attempts, it supports a non-murder scenario.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of these findings in a not-guilty scenario is fairly high.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the specific findings shifts:\n\n*   **Injuries not noted at the hospital:** It's plausible a perpetrator might inflict injuries subtly enough that they aren't immediately obvious to medical staff. Additionally, if medical staff are focused on resuscitation, some injuries could be missed. So the absence of initial notes is consistent.\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** Petechiae are not always present in smothering cases, so their absence doesn't necessarily exonerate.\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs attributed to other causes:** The prosecution would likely argue these explanations are a smokescreen to deflect from the inflicted trauma. The defense can point towards the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in natural deaths and the prosecution would argue these can exist due to external factors or other causes. The probability of the injuries being explained by resus attempts is increased if they are indeed consistent with such attempts.\n\nOverall, even with guilt, some explanations exist for the injuries to be misinterpreted or missed, but the perpetrator would also intend to cause the death without obvious marks. Thus, it is somewhat likely.\n\n60\n",
  "Based solely on the provided evidence, the probability of guilt is complex and requires balancing conflicting information. There are suspicious circumstances, especially the similarities in the deaths and the injuries found in both children. However, alternative explanations exist for some of the injuries, and the absence of some typical signs of smothering weakens the prosecution's case. SIDS remains a possibility.\n\nGiven the conflicting evidence and the high burden of proof required for a guilty verdict, I estimate the probability of guilt, based solely on this limited information, to be:\n\n65\n",
  "Based solely on the evidence presented, and acknowledging the high burden of proof required for a guilty verdict, my verdict is: Not guilty.\n"
