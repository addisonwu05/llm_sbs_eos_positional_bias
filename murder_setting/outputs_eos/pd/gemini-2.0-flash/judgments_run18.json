  "Here's a breakdown of why it's difficult to provide a precise probability, and a reasoned estimate given the information:\n\n**Why It's Difficult to Calculate a Precise Probability:**\n\n*   **Lack of Statistical Data:** We don't have reliable statistics on the co-occurrence of the specific findings (bruises, torn frenulum, hemorrhages, hypoxic damage) with SIDS in multiple siblings. It's inherently a rare event *regardless* of the explanation.\n*   **Conditional Probabilities:** To get a truly accurate probability, we'd need to know the conditional probability of each finding given SIDS versus given smothering. This kind of detailed data is very hard to come by.\n*   **Correlation vs. Causation:** The risk factors for SIDS only correlate with SIDS. They don't cause it and cannot be used as indicators to determine whether the similarities could be due to SIDS.\n\n**Reasoning for an Estimate:**\n\nGiven that Jane is NOT GUILTY, all findings were caused by SIDS or other natural causes of death. If that is the case, the similarities between the two incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are all due to a coincidence.\nThe likelihood of such a coincidence is very low, as some findings are more indicative of violence than SIDS. The possibility of SIDS occurring in two siblings is already a low probability, but the likelihood of the combination of the above findings further decreases the chance of it being a coincidence.\n\n**Probability Judgment:**\n\n5\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities, the timing of the hypoxic damage, and the injuries found on both children become much more likely. A guilty Jane would suggest a pattern of behavior, making the similar circumstances and the medical findings far less surprising.\n\n95\n",
  "Let's analyze the likelihood of these findings if Jane is *not guilty*, meaning the deaths were due to natural causes or mishandling/unintentional actions:\n\n*   **Injuries not present at hospital admission:** If the injuries occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, it's plausible they weren't present or noticeable upon initial hospital admission.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** SIDS doesn't typically cause petechiae. Resuscitation also wouldn't necessarily cause them.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** These being attributed to natural causes or resuscitation is consistent with the \"not guilty\" scenario.\n\n*   **Andy's injuries:** If Andy's injuries were due to resuscitation attempts as initially suggested, that also aligns with a \"not guilty\" scenario.\n\nGiven these points, it is possible that the injuries were due to natural causes or unintentional actions, and so the likelihood of these findings occurring if Jane is not guilty is a high number.\n\n80\n",
  "Let's consider this if Jane *is* guilty:\n\n*   **Injuries not present at hospital admission:** A guilty Jane might intentionally inflict injuries that wouldn't be immediately obvious to attending medical staff. Subtle injuries or those that develop quickly after arrival would fit this scenario.\n\n*   **Absence of petechiae:** While petechiae can be present in smothering, they aren't always. Their absence doesn't necessarily exonerate a guilty party, as the method of smothering may not always cause them.\n\n*   **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** A guilty Jane might inflict injuries during or after the act that could be misattributed to other causes, like rough handling or resuscitation.\n\n*   **Andy's injuries:** If Jane is guilty, Andy's injuries could have been masked, or attributed to other causes.\n\nThe injuries are still consistent with Jane being guilty, as it is possible she inflicted the injuries that weren't immediately obvious, and her actions were misattributed to other causes.\n\n70\n",
  "Based on the evidence, the similarities between the deaths, the suspicious injuries, and the timing when Jane was alone with the children, I assess the probability of guilt to be:\n\n75\n",
  "Based on the provided information and my assessment of the probability, my verdict is:\n\nGuilty\n"
