  "Calculating the probability of these specific events and findings occurring naturally, without any guilt on Jane's part, involves several complex factors. It requires considering the statistical likelihood of SIDS for both children, the medical indicators of possible abuse, and the context of the similarities in the timing and circumstances of the deaths.\n\n1. SIDS occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 infants in the UK. The likelihood of it happening twice in the same family is extremely low, but not impossible.\n\n2. The medical findings in both cases exhibit signs that are commonly associated with smothering or abuse, which are not typical of SIDS.\n\n3. The consistency in circumstances—the age of both infants, timing after feeding, and presence of only Jane when each child was found—raises suspicion but could also be coincidental.\n\nGiven these points, while it's challenging to provide a precise probability without further statistical analysis or specifics on similar historical cases, the available evidence leans towards the events not being coincidental or natural.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment for these events occurring naturally, given the described findings and circumstances, would be very low. **10**",
