  "Evaluating the likelihood of these factors occurring without foul play involves analyzing the statistical probability of each event and the plausibility of them aligning by chance:\n\n1. **Similarities between incidents**: The age and timing similarities can initially suggest a pattern often seen in criminal cases, but they might also be coincidental, though statistically less common.\n\n2. **Injuries indicative of abuse**: The injuries found in both children are serious and generally associated with external trauma, inconsistent with SIDS or natural causes.\n\n3. **Frequency of SIDS**: Given a rate of 1 in 4,000, the likelihood of two cases occurring in the same family is extremely low without an underlying risk factor.\n\n4. **Medical evidence of smothering/abuse**: The specific injuries, such as hypoxic damage caused hours before death, haemorrhages, and physical trauma, further reduce the probability that these deaths were natural.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood of all these similarities and evidence being purely coincidental if Jane were not guilty is exceedingly low, but not impossible.\n\n0",
