  "To estimate a probability, it's important to consider the rarity of SIDS, the medical evidence, and the circumstances surrounding each case. SIDS is quite rare, especially for two instances in the same family. While two cases of SIDS in one family can occur due to genetic or environmental factors, the medical evidence in this situation leans more towards non-natural causes.\n\nThe presence of hypoxic damage, hemorrhages, bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are not typical findings in cases of natural infant death and are more consistent with physical trauma or smothering. The similarity in the circumstances of the deaths, such as the age of the infants, the timing around feeding, and Jane being alone with the children, further raises suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the probability that all these similarities and medical findings in both incidents occurred by chance and without wrongdoing is relatively low. Therefore, the judgment that Jane is not guilty (assuming all medical evidence is accurately interpreted and true) would have to contend with a very low likelihood of natural cause under these conditions.\n\nThus, the probability that these similarities and findings occurred without any wrongdoing, if Jane is not guilty, is relatively low. An exact figure, reflecting this low likelihood while acknowledging the non-zero possibility of these findings resulting from natural causes, is:\n\n5",
