  "Assessing the probability of these events occurring if Jane is not guilty involves considering the likelihood of each element in isolation and in combination, assuming innocence. Given that both children died at a similar age and time of day, coupled with the medical findings indicative of smothering and potential abuse, these circumstances collectively suggest a pattern inconsistent with a natural or SIDS-related explanation. While SIDS can occur, the presence of specific physical injuries and hypoxic damage strongly linked to possible abuse or smothering reduces the likelihood of an innocent explanation significantly.\n\nTaking into account all these factors, the probability judgment that all these events and similarities occurred if Jane is not guilty is relatively low. \n\nTherefore, the probability that these findings and circumstances occurred by chance, assuming Jane's innocence, is roughly:\n\n10",
