  "The probability of two young siblings both experiencing sudden death under unexplained circumstances such as SIDS within a short period is quite low, especially given the 1 in 4,000 frequency of SIDS in the UK. Additionally, the presence of injuries indicative of trauma, such as hypoxic damage, retinal haemorrhages, and physical injuries in both children, further reduces the likelihood of these incidents being natural or coincidental if Jane is not guilty. Considering all these factors, the probability is very low. Therefore, the likelihood of these similarities occurring if Jane is not guilty is estimated at: **5**.",
