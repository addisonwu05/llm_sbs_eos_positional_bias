  "Given the evidence presented, the probability of these similarities occurring together and the injuries observed being coincidental if Jane is not guilty is quite low. Each factor—such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, combined with the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages found in Ben—is characteristic of deliberate harm rather than natural causes or SIDS. Furthermore, the striking similarities in the circumstances of both deaths add to the improbability of them occurring independently. Considering all the evidence, the probability of these occurrences being coincidental is extremely low if Jane is not guilty.\n\n***5***",
