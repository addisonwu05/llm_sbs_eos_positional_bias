  "Evaluating the likelihood of similarities between both incidents, given that Jane is not guilty, involves understanding the probabilities of these events occurring naturally or coincidentally without foul play being involved. The following points summarize key considerations:\n\n1. **Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)**: The probability of SIDS occurring is generally low, about 1 in 4,000, and having multiple cases in one family is rare, though not impossible.\n\n2. **Medical Findings**: The injuries and findings are consistent with smothering and trauma. While these could be attributed to other causes or misinterpretations, together they more likely suggest a pattern of abuse rather than natural causes like SIDS.\n\n3. **Temporal and Situational Similarities**: Two infants dying under very similar circumstances, timing, and conditions where only one parent is present may also imply a pattern, which reduces the likelihood of purely natural coincidences.\n\nGiven these considerations, assessing a concrete probability requires considering how rare each factor is independently and then theoretically correlating their simultaneous occurrence. Taking this into account, however, is fraught with difficulties and inaccuracies in probability theory due to non-statistical elements influencing real-world behavior.\n\nDespite this complexity, to fulfill the task of producing an integer probability:\n\n10",
