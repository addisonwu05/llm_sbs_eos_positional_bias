  "Evaluating the probability of these factors occurring by chance while assuming Jane is not guilty requires careful consideration of the alternative explanations, such as SIDS or other medical conditions, in conjunction with the presented evidence of potential abuse.\n\n1. **Rare Medical Conditions/SIDS**: The likelihood of one infant dying from SIDS is relatively low (1 in 4,000). The probability of two children from the same family dying from SIDS, while theoretically possible, is exceedingly rare.\n\n2. **Injury Evidence**: The specific injuries found on both infants—hypoxic damage, bruising, torn frenulum, and haemorrhages—correlate more strongly with smothering or abuse than with common presentations of SIDS. These injuries are particularly concerning and suggestive of non-natural causes.\n\n3. **Similarities in Incidents**: The similarities in the timing, circumstances, and Jane finding both children unconscious alone strongly suggest a non-coincidental pattern. While not impossible under natural circumstances, the probability of such repeated timing and situational similarities occurring naturally is very low.\n\nGiven that SIDS does not typically present with such specific injuries and considering the rare statistical likelihood of two siblings dying from such a condition under similar circumstances, the convergence of these factors under the assumption of innocence would be an incredibly low-probability event.\n\nTherefore, while keeping an open mind to rare natural occurrences and acknowledging that absence of certainty, the probability of all these similarities and injuries occurring purely by chance is very low. \n\n0",
