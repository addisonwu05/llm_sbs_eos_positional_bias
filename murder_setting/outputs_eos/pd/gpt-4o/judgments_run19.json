  "Assessing the probability in such a complex legal case involves evaluating various pieces of evidence and the likelihood of different explanations. \n\n1. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is statistically rare, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 among infants in the UK. Having two SIDS cases in the same family would be even rarer.\n2. The presence of injuries such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found on re-examination in Andy's case, along with hypoxic damage, brain haemorrhages, and spinal injuries in Ben's case, are strongly indicative of possible foul play or abuse rather than natural or unexplained causes.\n3. The timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain a matter of hours before death suggests a non-natural cause close to the time of death.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of both deaths occurring under the identical circumstances by sheer coincidence and adhering to a natural SIDS cause, without any external intervention involved, seems statistically unlikely.\n\n0",
