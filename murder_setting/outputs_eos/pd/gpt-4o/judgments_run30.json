  "Given the details provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of all the described similarities and injuries occurring purely by chance would involve an extremely rare alignment of multiple factors. These would include the low statistical likelihood of having two instances of SIDS within the same family along with the specific injuries found during the autopsy. Considering these factors and the background information provided, the probability of these events occurring simultaneously under the assumption of innocence is exceedingly low.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is: 3",
  "97",
  "75",
  "20",
