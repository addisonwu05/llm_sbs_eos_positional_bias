  "Determining a precise probability in this case is extremely difficult due to the complexity and the various factors involved, including medical, statistical, and circumstantial evidence. However, given the presented evidence of physical trauma that is typically inconsistent with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the rarity of such occurrences happening twice in succession under similar circumstances, the probability of both incidents being purely coincidental and both being cases of SIDS (with the additional evidence of trauma) is statistically very low.\n\nConsidering these factors, the estimated probability might be around 5.",
