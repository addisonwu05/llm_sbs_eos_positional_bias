  "To provide a verdict, we need to consider whether the evidence presented proves the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe case against Jane is based on the similarities between the deaths of her two sons and the medical findings that suggest possible smothering. However, there are also significant doubts raised by alternative explanations for the observed injuries and the absence of certain signs typically associated with smothering.\n\nThe principle of \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" requires that the evidence be so strong that there is no reasonable doubt about the defendant's guilt. While the prosecution's case raises suspicions and presents some compelling evidence (especially the re-examination findings), the presence of alternative explanations and the lack of definitive proof (such as petechiae in Ben) introduces doubt.\n\nGiven the information and analysis, the evidence does not conclusively prove Jane's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNot guilty"
