Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed similarities and medical findings if Jane is not guilty, we must consider the probability of these events occurring by chance or due to other factors such as SIDS.\n\n1. **Similarities between both incidents**: Both babies dying at a similar age and under similar circumstances (found unconscious after being fed and when Jane was alone with them) could be coincidental, especially if one considers that both deaths could be attributed to SIDS or another natural cause. The probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is low but not impossible.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death**: This is a specific medical finding that indicates a lack of oxygen to the brain. If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the timing of hypoxic damage might not necessarily align with smothering or violent trauma.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are specific pathological findings. While they are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, they can also be associated with other causes.\n\n4. **Bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: These findings were discovered upon re-examination of Andy's autopsy photographs. They are indicative of trauma but were not initially noted, suggesting either they were missed or were not visible at the time of the initial autopsy.\n\nTo assess the likelihood of these findings if Jane is not guilty (i.e., if both deaths were due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions), we must consider the probability of these specific medical findings occurring coincidentally in two siblings.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is given as 1 in 4,000. The probability of two consecutive SIDS deaths is (1/4000)^2, which is very low (1 in 16,000,000). However, the presence of specific traumatic injuries in both babies complicates this assessment.\n\nIf we were to ignore the traumatic injuries for a moment and focus on the coincidence of two infant deaths under similar circumstances, the base probability is already very low due to the rarity of SIDS.\n\nHowever, the presence of traumatic injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung in Andy, and hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben) in both cases makes it highly unlikely that both deaths were due to SIDS or other natural causes, as these injuries suggest some form of trauma.\n\nThe likelihood of these specific findings occurring by chance, in the context of SIDS or another natural cause, is extremely low. \n\nGiven the information and focusing on the requirement to provide a probability judgment as an integer between 0 and 100:\n\n5"
