  "To provide a verdict, we must assess the evidence presented and determine whether it proves the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBased on the initial presentation of the case, the prosecution's evidence suggested that Jane was guilty of smothering her two sons due to the similarities in their deaths and the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma.\n\nHowever, subsequent revelations provided alternative explanations for some of the key findings:\n- The injuries found on Andy could be attributed to resuscitation attempts.\n- The absence of typical signs of smothering in Ben, such as petechiae.\n- The spinal bleeding in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\n- The dislocated ribs in Ben could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\n\nThese alternative explanations introduce significant doubt regarding Jane's guilt. The prosecution's case, while initially appearing strong, is weakened by these alternative explanations.\n\nGiven the reasonable doubt introduced by these alternative explanations, the evidence does not prove Jane's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNot guilty"
