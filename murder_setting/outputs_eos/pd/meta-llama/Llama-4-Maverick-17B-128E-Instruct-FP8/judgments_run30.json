  "Based on the information and evidence presented in the case, I would state that the defendant, Jane, is Not Guilty.\n\nThe evidence, while suspicious and initially pointing towards guilt due to the similarities in the deaths and the presence of injuries indicative of trauma, is not conclusively proven. Alternative explanations for the observed injuries, such as resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, and the lack of certain expected signs of smothering (like petechiae in Ben), introduce reasonable doubt.\n\nTherefore, based on the principle of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the verdict is: Not Guilty."
