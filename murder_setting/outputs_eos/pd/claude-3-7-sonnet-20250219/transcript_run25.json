Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The collection of injuries, particularly the torn frenulum and bruising, are highly consistent with abuse. The fact that both children showed evidence of trauma makes coincidence extremely unlikely.\n\nIf Jane is innocent, we would need to accept that:\n1. Both children had conditions causing death at similar ages\n2. Both developed injuries consistent with trauma through natural causes or by someone else\n3. Both happened to die when only Jane was present\n\nThe combination of all these factors occurring naturally or coincidentally is extremely improbable.\n\n10"

Spinal bleeding in Ben being a common finding in natural death - this suggests a non-criminal explanation\n2. Dislocated ribs potentially occurring post-mortem or from resuscitation - medical interventions could explain these injuries\n3. Absence of petechiae in Ben - this is significant as petechiae are often considered typical markers of smothering\n4. Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts - provides an alternative explanation for what was previously characterized as abuse signs\n5. Ben's injuries not being noted by nurses at the hospital - suggests the injuries may have occurred after arrival or were minor enough to be missed, or perhaps resulted from post-mortem processes\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, there's a reasonable probability that:\n- The spinal bleeding was natural\n- The rib injuries occurred during resuscitation\n- Andy's injuries were indeed from resuscitation attempts\n- The lack of petechiae contradicts the smothering theory\n- The hospital staff's failure to note injuries suggests they weren't present or obvious initially\n\nThese alternative explanations for the physical findings substantially increase the probability that these findings could occur if Jane is not guilty.\n\n70"

However, this creates some inconsistency with the smothering hypothesis.\n\nThe absence of petechiae in Ben is problematic for the prosecution's case, as these tiny hemorrhages are often considered hallmarks of smothering or strangulation. Their absence makes the smothering scenario less likely, even if Jane is guilty.\n\nThe dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes is plausible regardless of Jane's guilt, so this finding doesn't strongly support either hypothesis.\n\nThe spinal bleeding being common in natural death significantly weakens the connection between this finding and intentional harm.\n\nAndy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides a reasonable alternative explanation even if Jane is guilty.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, these specific findings create a somewhat inconsistent picture - some findings support guilt while others (particularly the absence of petechiae and injuries not noted initially) are less consistent with intentional smothering.\n\n45"
