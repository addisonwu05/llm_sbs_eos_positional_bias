Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

If Jane smothered Ben, some injuries should have been visible upon hospital arrival, though certain internal injuries might not be immediately apparent.\n- The absence of petechiae (tiny red spots) in Ben is significant, as these are often considered characteristic signs of smothering. Their absence weakens the case for smothering.\n- The dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation efforts or post-mortem changes is plausible even in a murder scenario, as these could indeed result from CPR.\n- Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts means they don't necessarily indicate abuse if they match the expected pattern from revival efforts.\n- The spinal bleeding having natural causes reduces its value as evidence of foul play.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering both children, these particular findings create some inconsistencies with typical smothering cases. While not impossible (as smothering doesn't always leave the same evidence pattern), the absence of some expected signs and the potential alternative explanations for others reduce the likelihood of these specific findings in a guilty scenario.\n\n55"
