Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Specific injuries found in both children including:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lung (Andy)\n   - Injuries to ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic brain damage, and eye hemorrhages (Ben)\n3.

The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death aligns with the timeline of a deliberate smothering.\n3. The specific injuries observed:\n   - Hypoxic brain damage and eye hemorrhages in Ben are classic findings in smothering cases\n   - Bruises to arms and legs could result from restraint during smothering\n   - A torn frenulum is consistent with forced trauma to the mouth area during smothering\n   - Blood in the lung can occur during a struggle while being smothered\n\nThese findings are highly consistent with the medical literature on child homicide by smothering. The constellation of injuries seen in both children represents the typical pattern of injuries that medical examiners would expect to find in smothering cases.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, these specific medical findings would be very likely as they directly correspond to the known pathophysiology of death by smothering and associated trauma.\n\n95"

Ben's injuries were not noted by nurses when brought to the hospital - This significantly undermines the certainty that the injuries pre-existed hospital arrival, suggesting they could have occurred during resuscitation efforts.\n\n2. Absence of petechiae in Ben - Petechiae are considered common in smothering cases, so their absence weakens the evidence for smothering as the cause of death.\n\n3. Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts - This provides a reasonable alternative explanation for what was previously characterized as evidence of abuse.\n\n4. Spinal bleeding in Ben being common in natural death - This reframes what was presented as evidence of trauma as potentially being a natural finding.\n\n5. Dislocated ribs possibly occurring post-mortem or during resuscitation - This offers an alternative explanation for injuries that might otherwise suggest trauma.\n\nGiven these alternative explanations for the physical findings, and the fact that key evidence expected in smothering cases was absent, the probability that these specific injuries and circumstances would exist if Jane is not guilty is substantially higher than my previous assessment. The injuries could reasonably be explained by resuscitation attempts and post-mortem changes rather than deliberate harm.\n\n65"

Ben's injuries not being noted by nurses upon hospital arrival - If Jane is guilty, this would be unusual, as significant injuries from deliberate smothering would likely be visible. Hospital staff typically document all observable injuries upon admission.\n\n2. Absence of petechiae in Ben - This is significant because petechiae are considered a hallmark finding in many smothering deaths. Their absence would be somewhat unexpected if deliberate smothering occurred.\n\n3. Spinal bleeding characterized as common in natural death - If Jane is guilty, this finding would still be consistent, but it would lose its value as evidence of foul play.\n\n4. Dislocated ribs potentially from resuscitation or post-mortem changes - If Jane is guilty, these could still occur from the resuscitation process regardless of the initial cause of death.\n\n5. Andy's injuries being attributable to resuscitation - If Jane is guilty, these injuries could still be consistent with both smothering and subsequent resuscitation attempts.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the lack of documentation of injuries upon hospital arrival and the absence of petechiae would be somewhat unexpected and less likely. A guilty perpetrator might still cause death by smothering without leaving all the \"typical\" signs, but the absence of key expected findings reduces the likelihood.\n\n40"
