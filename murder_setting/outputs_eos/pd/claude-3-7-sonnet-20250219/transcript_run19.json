Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

For two siblings to both die of SIDS would be extremely rare, though not impossible.\n\nThe specific injuries noted - especially the bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages in the eyes - are described as characteristic of smothering and abuse. Medical literature generally indicates these injuries are highly consistent with non-accidental trauma rather than natural causes.\n\nThe temporal similarities (similar age at death, similar time of day, after feeding, when alone with Jane) add another layer of coincidence that would be difficult to explain by natural causes.\n\nFor all these specific injuries and coincidental similarities to occur in both children without foul play would be extremely improbable. The physical evidence, particularly the constellation of injuries consistent with smothering, strongly suggests non-accidental trauma.\n\n5"

Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung) are now attributed to resuscitation attempts, which is medically plausible, especially in infants whose tissues are delicate.\n\n2. For Ben:\n   - The absence of petechiae is significant, as these are often considered hallmark signs of smothering\n   - Spinal bleeding is identified as common in natural deaths\n   - Dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem handling or resuscitation\n   - Hospital nurses did not document the injuries upon admission\n\nIf these injuries can be explained by resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, and if key evidence of smothering (petechiae) was absent, then the probability increases substantially that these findings could exist in a scenario where Jane is not guilty. Aggressive resuscitation attempts can cause many of the described injuries, and the absence of documentation by nurses suggests some injuries may have developed after hospital admission.\n\nThe fact that both children died remains concerning, but SIDS, while rare, does occur and can run in families.\n\n75"
