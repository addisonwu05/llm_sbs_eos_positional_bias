  "The question asks for the probability of observing all the given evidence *if* Jane is NOT GUILTY. This means we are evaluating the likelihood of the evidence under the hypothesis that both children died of natural causes (like SIDS, as suggested in the background, or other unknown natural causes), and Jane did not harm them.\n\nLet's break down the evidence and evaluate its likelihood under the \"Not Guilty\" (natural death) hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** These findings are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Andy died of natural causes (e.g., SIDS), these types of injuries (especially a torn frenulum, which implies trauma to the mouth, and unexplained bruises) are highly unlikely to be present. They directly contradict a natural, non-violent death.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the hypoxic damage occurring a matter of hours before death:** These findings are stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" While some degree of hypoxia can occur in SIDS, severe hypoxic damage lasting \"hours\" before death, combined with haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids (often indicative of asphyxia), is not characteristic of a sudden, unexplained natural death like SIDS. These findings are strongly suggestive of a period of oxygen deprivation caused by an external act.\n\n3.  **Similarities between both incidents:** Both babies were about the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks), died at similar times of day after feeding, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. While a single SIDS death is rare (1 in 4,000), the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family, with such striking similarities in circumstances and age, is exceedingly rare. When combined with specific findings of trauma/asphyxia in both children, these similarities become even less probable under a natural, independent SIDS explanation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIf Jane is truly not guilty and her children died of natural causes, then the presence of evidence explicitly described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" (Andy's injuries) and \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" (Ben's injuries) is overwhelmingly improbable. Natural deaths typically do not present with findings that mimic violent trauma so precisely. The combined weight of specific physical injuries inconsistent with natural causes, coupled with the extreme rarity of two such \"natural\" deaths occurring with similar circumstances, makes the \"Not Guilty\" hypothesis extremely difficult to reconcile with the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of observing all these pieces of evidence if Jane is NOT GUILTY is extremely close to zero.\n\n0",

  "Based on the given evidence, we must integrate two sets of information: the initial findings that suggested guilt and the subsequent information that casts doubt on those findings.\n\n**Initial Findings (Evidence leaning towards Guilt - E_G):**\n*   **Andy:** Re-examination found bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, blood in lung, explicitly stated as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n*   **Ben:** Autopsy found injuries to ribs/spinal cord, hypoxic damage to brain (hours before death), haemorrhages to eyes/eyelids. These are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"\n*   **Similarities:** Both babies same age, died similar time of day after feeding, found unconscious by Jane when she was alone. Described as \"astonishing.\"\n\n**Doubt-Casting/Exculpatory Evidence (E_D):**\n*   **Ben's injuries not noted by nurses:** Suggests they may not have been obvious or external trauma.\n*   **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are typical injuries in death due to smothering. Their absence significantly weakens the smothering hypothesis.\n*   **Ben's spinal bleeding common in natural death:** Re-interprets one of the initially suspicious findings as natural.\n*   **Ben's dislocated ribs probably post-mortem or due to resuscitation:** Re-interprets another suspicious finding as non-abusive.\n*   **Andy's injuries initially put down to resuscitation and consistent with resuscitation:** Re-interprets Andy's injuries as non-abusive.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Case with All Evidence:**\n\n1.  **Andy's Case:** The initial findings of bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were \"indicative of abuse.\" However, the new information states these \"are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This dramatically weakens the evidence for abuse in Andy's case, as the suspicious injuries are now credibly explained by resuscitation efforts.\n\n2.  **Ben's Case:**\n    *   The dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding, initially suspicious, are now largely explained away as \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\" and \"a common finding in natural death,\" respectively.\n    *   Crucially, the \"absence of injuries such as petechiae\" (a typical sign of smothering) is a strong counter-indicator against the smothering hypothesis for Ben.\n    *   What remains as the strongest physical evidence against Jane for Ben's death are the \"hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain... caused a matter of hours before death\" and \"haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids,\" which are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" While concerning, without other corroborating signs of trauma and with the absence of expected signs like petechiae, their interpretation becomes less conclusive for *murder* specifically, as some degree of hypoxia and distress can occur in natural deaths.\n\n3.  **Similarities:** The \"astonishing similarities\" (age, time, Jane alone) remain as strong circumstantial evidence. However, the strength of this evidence to prove *guilt* is significantly diminished if the *physical evidence of abuse* is largely explained away by natural causes or medical intervention. If the medical findings are now mostly equivocal or consistent with innocent causes, then the similarities, while statistically rare for two independent SIDS deaths, do not definitively prove foul play.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe initial evidence strongly suggested guilt, primarily due to the interpretation of specific injuries as abusive. However, the subsequent evidence provides credible alternative, innocent explanations for most of those injuries (resuscitation, natural causes) and, critically, points to the *absence* of a key expected sign for smothering (petechiae).\n\nThis significantly weakens the prosecution's case. While Ben's hypoxia and eye haemorrhages, along with the \"astonishing similarities,\" are still suspicious, the overall picture no longer points overwhelmingly to guilt. The case now contains substantial reasonable doubt, as a significant portion of the evidence initially interpreted as abuse can now be interpreted as consistent with natural death or medical intervention. The absence of petechiae, in particular, creates a major hole in the smothering theory.\n\nGiven the strong alternative explanations for most of the suspicious physical findings and the lack of a key expected injury, the probability that Jane is guilty is significantly reduced.\n\n40",
