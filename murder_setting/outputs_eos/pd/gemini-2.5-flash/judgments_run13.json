  "The probability that these specific medical findings and similarities would be present if Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning the children died of SIDS or another natural cause) is extremely low.\n\nHere's why:\n*   **Medical Findings Contradict SIDS:** The key piece of information is that the described injuries for both children (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, bruises to arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" or \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a diagnosis of exclusion; it is applied when a thorough investigation, including autopsy, fails to find a cause of death. The presence of these specific traumatic injuries and signs of asphyxiation would *rule out* a SIDS diagnosis. Therefore, if the children truly died of SIDS, these findings should not be present in their autopsies.\n*   **Doctor's Allegation:** The allegation that Ben's hypoxic damage was caused \"a matter of hours before death\" also goes against the definition of SIDS, which is a *sudden* and *unexplained* death.\n*   **Similarities in Incidents:** While two SIDS deaths in one family are rare (approximately 1 in 16 million if based on general population SIDS rates), the specific similarities in circumstances (same age range, similar time after feeding, Jane alone at discovery) occurring twice by pure chance are also quite improbable. However, the medical findings are far more decisive.\n\nBecause the listed medical findings directly contradict and would typically preclude a diagnosis of SIDS, the likelihood of finding this evidence if Jane is not guilty (and the deaths were natural like SIDS) is exceptionally remote. The question is essentially asking, \"If the deaths were natural, how likely is it that the autopsies would show strong evidence of unnatural, violent death?\" This probability is very close to zero.\n\n1",

  "The new information significantly re-contextualizes the evidence, making it much more consistent with a scenario where Jane is NOT GUILTY (i.e., the children died of natural causes or accidents unrelated to abuse by Jane).\n\nLet's evaluate each point under the assumption that Jane is NOT GUILTY:\n\n1.  **\"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\"** If Ben died of natural causes and resuscitation attempts were made, it is highly likely that these findings would be present.\n2.  **\"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\"** If Jane is NOT GUILTY, there would be no external signs of abuse for nurses to observe. Any internal injuries would not typically be noted externally. This makes the absence of nurse observation highly likely.\n3.  **\"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae (tiny red or purple spots that can appear on the skin).\"** If Jane is NOT GUILTY, Ben was not smothered. Therefore, the absence of typical smothering signs like petechiae is highly likely.\n4.  **\"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"** If Andy died of natural causes and was subjected to resuscitation, it is highly likely that these injuries would be present and correctly attributed to those attempts.\n\nAll the points listed in the question are described as highly probable, common, or consistent with a scenario where Jane is NOT GUILTY and the deaths were natural, followed by resuscitation efforts. Therefore, the likelihood of these specific findings being present if Jane is NOT GUILTY is very high.\n\n90",
