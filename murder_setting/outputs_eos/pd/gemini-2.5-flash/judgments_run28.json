  "The question asks for the likelihood of the presented evidence (E) if Jane is NOT GUILTY (H0). We need to assess P(E | H0).\n\nLet's break down the evidence (E) and evaluate its probability under the hypothesis that Jane is NOT GUILTY. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that she did not smother her children. Therefore, the deaths must have been due to natural causes, accidents not involving Jane, or abuse by another person.\n\nThe evidence consists of:\n1.  **Similarities between incidents:** Both babies died at similar young ages (11 weeks and 8 weeks), at similar times of day after feeding, and both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n2.  **Ben's injuries:** Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" The hypoxic damage was alleged to have occurred hours before death.\n3.  **Andy's injuries (from re-examination):** Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the likelihood of this evidence if Jane is NOT GUILTY:\n\n*   **Medical Findings (Injuries):** Both children presented with a constellation of severe injuries (rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, eye haemorrhages, bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) that are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" or \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"\n    *   If Jane is not guilty, these injuries would have to be explained by natural causes or accidents not involving Jane. However, these specific injuries are widely recognized as hallmarks of non-accidental trauma and are inconsistent with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or typical natural causes. SIDS, by definition, is a diagnosis of exclusion after a thorough investigation finds no other cause, including trauma. The probability of such extensive traumatic injuries arising spontaneously from a natural condition in two separate infants is extraordinarily low, bordering on medically impossible.\n    *   The probability of such injuries resulting from unrelated, non-abusive accidents (e.g., minor falls) in two infants, without Jane's involvement, is also extremely low, especially considering the specific nature (e.g., spinal cord injury, torn frenulum).\n\n*   **Similarities between incidents:** The fact that both deaths occurred at similar young ages, similar times, and that Jane was alone and discovered both children is presented as \"astonishing.\"\n    *   If both deaths were natural (e.g., SIDS, which is stated as a possible explanation for some deaths), the probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family, while higher than for two unrelated individuals, is still very rare (e.g., 1 in 1.6 million, even with an increased risk for the second child).\n    *   When combined with the specific, traumatic injuries found in both children, the probability of *two* independent natural or accidental deaths that *also* happen to perfectly mimic abuse in such similar circumstances becomes infinitesimally small.\n\n*   **Combined Probability:** The evidence, taken as a whole, presents a pattern of highly specific traumatic injuries in two infants, occurring under remarkably similar circumstances. If Jane is not guilty, it means these injuries were *not* inflicted by her, and the deaths were *not* caused by her. This forces us to accept that:\n    *   Either the medical assessment of the injuries as indicative of abuse/smothering is fundamentally incorrect, and they are common natural/accidental findings (highly unlikely given medical consensus).\n    *   Or, some extremely rare and unknown natural conditions or highly improbable accidental events caused all these severe, trauma-like injuries in both children, coincidentally under such similar circumstances, and Jane happened to be alone and discover both.\n    *   Or, someone else abused/smothered both children, managing to do so without Jane's knowledge while she was alone with them, and she consistently discovered the victims. This scenario, while explaining the injuries, makes the \"Jane was alone\" factor highly suspicious if she is innocent.\n\nGiven the overwhelming medical evidence of trauma consistent with smothering/abuse in both children, coupled with the \"astonishing similarities\" in the circumstances of death, the probability of all this evidence occurring if Jane is truly innocent (and therefore not responsible for the deaths or injuries) is exceptionally low. Such a confluence of specific, severe injuries and circumstances, contradicting typical natural or accidental explanations, makes the \"not guilty\" hypothesis highly improbable as an explanation for the observed evidence.\n\nThe likelihood P(E | H0) is therefore very close to 0.\n\n1",

  "The question asks for the likelihood of a specific set of evidence (E') given that Jane is NOT GUILTY (H0). If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not smother her children, and their deaths were due to natural causes, accidents not involving her, or abuse by another person (though the latter is less relevant here given the specific re-interpretations of the evidence).\n\nLet's evaluate each piece of evidence under the hypothesis that Jane is NOT GUILTY:\n\n1.  **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are typical in smothering but not universally present. If Ben died of natural causes (as implied by Jane being not guilty of smothering), the absence of petechiae is a highly consistent finding, making this evidence very likely under H0.\n\n2.  **Ben's injuries not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:** The previously mentioned injuries (ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages) were not noted by nurses. If Jane is not guilty, and Ben died naturally, it's plausible that these injuries were either:\n    *   Subtle or internal and not readily apparent to nurses during initial assessment.\n    *   Developed or became more evident post-mortem or during attempts at resuscitation.\n    *   Were a consequence of the severe natural illness leading to death, and not immediately recognized as distinct signs of trauma by nurses focusing on resuscitation.\n    This makes it reasonably likely that nurses might not note them, especially if they weren't due to gross, externally obvious abuse by Jane.\n\n3.  **Ben's spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death:** This statement directly provides a natural, non-abusive explanation for the spinal bleeding previously noted as an \"injury to the spinal cord.\" If Jane is not guilty, and Ben died of natural causes, then finding spinal bleeding that is common in natural death is highly consistent with H0.\n\n4.  **Ben's dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts:** Similar to the spinal bleeding, this statement provides a non-abusive explanation for the previously noted \"injuries to the ribs.\" If Jane is not guilty and Ben died naturally, resuscitation attempts would have been made, and post-mortem changes occur. Therefore, dislocated ribs from these causes are highly consistent with H0.\n\n5.  **Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby:** This statement directly explains the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy (initially \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\") as being consistent with resuscitation. If Jane is not guilty and Andy died naturally, resuscitation would have been attempted. Thus, these injuries being due to resuscitation are highly consistent with H0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis new set of information provides alternative, non-abusive explanations for virtually all the physical injuries that were previously presented as suspicious or indicative of abuse. If Jane is not guilty, it means these children died of natural causes, and the explanations provided (resuscitation effects, post-mortem changes, common natural findings, absence of typical abuse signs, and nurses potentially missing subtle signs) are all highly consistent with that hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of this specific collection of evidence, which largely defuses the physical findings as indicators of abuse, given that Jane is NOT GUILTY, is very high.\n\n90",

  "To determine the probability that the defendant is guilty (P(H1 | E_total)), we need to combine the likelihood judgments from the previous steps using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet:\n*   H1 be the hypothesis that Jane is Guilty.\n*   H0 be the hypothesis that Jane is Not Guilty.\n*   E1 be the first set of evidence (similarities and initial injury findings).\n*   E2 be the second set of evidence (absence of petechiae, re-interpretation of other injuries).\n\nFrom the previous steps, we have the following likelihoods:\n1.  P(E1 | H0) = 1 (interpreted as 1% or 0.01)\n2.  P(E1 | H1) = 95 (interpreted as 95% or 0.95)\n3.  P(E2 | H0) = 90 (interpreted as 90% or 0.90)\n4.  P(E2 | H1) = 85 (interpreted as 85% or 0.85)\n\nWe will assume a neutral prior probability for guilt, P(H1) = 0.5 (and P(H0) = 0.5).\n\nAssuming conditional independence between E1 and E2 given each hypothesis (a common simplification in such problems), the likelihood of the total evidence (E_total = E1 AND E2) under each hypothesis is:\n*   P(E_total | H1) = P(E1 | H1) * P(E2 | H1) = 0.95 * 0.85 = 0.8075\n*   P(E_total | H0) = P(E1 | H0) * P(E2 | H0) = 0.01 * 0.90 = 0.009\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior probability of guilt using Bayes' Theorem:\nP(H1 | E_total) = [P(E_total | H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E_total | H1) * P(H1) + P(E_total | H0) * P(H0)]\n\nSubstitute the values:\nP(H1 | E_total) = (0.8075 * 0.5) / (0.8075 * 0.5 + 0.009 * 0.5)\nP(H1 | E_total) = 0.40375 / (0.40375 + 0.0045)\nP(H1 | E_total) = 0.40375 / 0.40825\nP(H1 | E_total) ≈ 0.98909\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer:\n0.98909 * 100% ≈ 99%\n\n99",
