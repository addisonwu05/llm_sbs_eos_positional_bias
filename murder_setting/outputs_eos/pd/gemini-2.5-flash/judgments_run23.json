  "The question asks for the probability that all the specified evidence would be present *if Jane is NOT GUILTY*. The \"NOT GUILTY\" hypothesis implies that the children died of natural causes, specifically Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as this is presented as the alternative explanation.\n\nLet's analyze the evidence under the assumption that the deaths were due to SIDS:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** Both babies died at similar ages (8 and 11 weeks), at similar times after feeding, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone. While described as \"astonishing,\" it is statistically rare for two SIDS deaths to occur in the same family, but not impossible. Some similarities might be coincidental or related to family routines. However, this aspect is less definitive than the medical findings.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain caused a matter of hours before death:** SIDS is defined as a *sudden* and unexplainable death. Hypoxic damage occurring *hours* before death suggests a prolonged event or trauma, which is inconsistent with the \"sudden\" nature of SIDS.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The text explicitly states these are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" These findings (especially eye and eyelid haemorrhages) are generally not typical of SIDS and are considered strong indicators of asphyxia or abuse. The presence of such injuries makes a SIDS diagnosis highly unlikely.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** The text explicitly states these are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These are positive findings of trauma and abuse. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is only diagnosed when no other cause of death (including trauma or abuse) can be identified. The presence of these specific injuries effectively rules out SIDS.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means the children died of natural causes (SIDS). However, the evidence described for both children includes specific injuries (hypoxic damage hours before death, eye haemorrhages, bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) that are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma,\" \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nThe very definition of SIDS requires the absence of such findings. If such injuries are present, the death is attributed to the trauma/abuse, not SIDS. Therefore, the likelihood of finding these specific, abuse-indicative injuries *if* the deaths were truly SIDS is virtually impossible.\n\nGiven the strong and explicit medical characterization of the findings as indicative of abuse/smothering, their presence is fundamentally contradictory to a diagnosis of SIDS.\n\nThe probability of all these pieces of evidence occurring if Jane is NOT GUILTY (i.e., the deaths were SIDS) is extremely low.\n\n0",
