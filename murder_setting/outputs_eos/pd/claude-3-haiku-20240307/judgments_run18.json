  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and medical findings occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\nThe coincidence of two young infants, both about 8-11 weeks old, dying suddenly while under the care of the same parent is highly suspicious. The presence of clear signs of physical abuse, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and hemorrhages, further indicates a non-natural cause of death.\n\nAdditionally, the medical evidence of hypoxic brain damage in Ben's case, which the doctor stated was consistent with smothering or other violent trauma and occurred shortly before death, is very compelling. The corroborating evidence from the re-examination of Andy's case adds further weight to the conclusion that these were not natural deaths.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS, the specific similarities between the two incidents, and the clear medical evidence of non-accidental trauma, the probability that Jane is not guilty is extremely low.\n\nProbability judgment: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and medical findings is very high.\n\nThe fact that both infants died suddenly while under Jane's sole care, at similar ages and times of day, is highly indicative of a pattern of behavior. The presence of clear physical evidence of abuse, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and hemorrhages, further supports the conclusion that these were not natural deaths.\n\nThe medical evidence of hypoxic brain damage in Ben's case, which the doctor stated was consistent with smothering or other violent trauma and occurred shortly before death, is compelling evidence of foul play. The corroborating evidence from the re-examination of Andy's case adds further weight to the conclusion that these were not natural deaths.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS, the specific similarities between the two incidents, and the clear medical evidence of non-accidental trauma, the probability that Jane is guilty is very high.\n\nProbability judgment: 95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, and the explanations for the spinal bleeding, dislocated ribs, and injuries found in Andy is quite high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital suggests that these injuries may have occurred later, potentially during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem. The presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which can be common in natural deaths and resuscitation efforts, further supports the possibility that these were not indicative of smothering.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of more typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case raises doubts about the conclusion that he was smothered. The injuries found in Andy's case being attributed to the resuscitation attempts is also plausible, as such injuries are often seen in these situations, especially for a baby.\n\nGiven the potential alternative explanations for the medical findings in both cases, and the lack of more conclusive evidence of smothering, the probability that Jane is not guilty is relatively high.\n\nProbability judgment: 75",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, and the explanations for the dislocated ribs and injuries found in Andy is quite low.\n\nGiven that Jane is the one accused of the murders, it is highly unlikely that the injuries on Ben were not present when he was initially brought to the hospital. The fact that nurses did not note these injuries could suggest an attempt to cover up the evidence of smothering.\n\nThe absence of more typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, is concerning, as these are often seen in cases of suffocation. However, the lack of these injuries does not necessarily rule out smothering, as they are not always present.\n\nThe explanations for the dislocated ribs and injuries found in Andy's case, as being due to resuscitation attempts or natural causes, are less convincing if Jane is indeed guilty. These injuries could potentially have been caused by the same abusive actions that led to the deaths of the infants.\n\nOverall, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these alternative explanations for the medical findings is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 25",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murder of her two children is high.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, the medical evidence of non-accidental trauma (such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages in Ben's case), and the corroborating findings from the re-examination of Andy's case all point strongly towards foul play.\n\nWhile the alternative explanations provided, such as the injuries being due to resuscitation efforts or natural causes, are plausible, the weight of the evidence seems to outweigh these explanations, especially given the rarity of SIDS.\n\nTherefore, considering the totality of the circumstances, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\nProbability judgment: 80",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
