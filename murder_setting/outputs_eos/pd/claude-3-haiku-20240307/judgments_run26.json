  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low.\n\nThe sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a well-documented phenomenon, and the risk factors associated with it, such as the age of the infants and the time of the day when the deaths occurred, are not uncommon. Additionally, the similarities in the circumstances of the two deaths do not necessarily indicate foul play, as SIDS can sometimes manifest in seemingly similar ways.\n\nFurthermore, the medical evidence, such as the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the various injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, could potentially be explained by other factors, including underlying medical conditions or unintentional injuries, rather than intentional smothering or violent trauma.\n\nGiven the complexity of SIDS and the potential for alternative explanations for the observed medical evidence, the likelihood of these similarities and the medical findings occurring in a case of innocent parents is relatively low, but not negligible.\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely high.\n\nThe similarities in the circumstances, such as the age of the infants and the timing of the deaths, along with the consistent medical evidence of smothering or violent trauma, strongly suggest a pattern of behavior and intentional actions by the same perpetrator, in this case, Jane.\n\nThe hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, as well as the other physical injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, are all highly characteristic of smothering and consistent with a deliberate and violent act, rather than a natural or accidental cause of death.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence pointing to a pattern of behavior and the nature of the medical findings, the likelihood of these similarities and medical findings occurring if Jane is guilty is extremely high.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively high.\n\nThe explanation that the injuries found on Ben, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were common findings in natural deaths or could have occurred during resuscitation attempts is plausible. The absence of typical smothering injuries, like petechiae, also suggests that the cause of Ben's death may not have been due to deliberate smothering.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital indicates that they may have been minor or not present at that time, further supporting the possibility that they were not the result of intentional harm.\n\nThe injuries found in Andy's case being attributed to the resuscitation attempts, as is common, also aligns with the idea that these injuries may not have been indicative of deliberate abuse.\n\nGiven the alternative explanations for the medical findings and the lack of clear evidence of intentional harm, the likelihood of these factors occurring if Jane is not guilty is relatively high.\n\n75%",
