  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities and the medical findings occurring by chance is extremely low. The coincidence of two infant deaths with such striking similarities and medical evidence pointing to smothering or other violent trauma is highly improbable.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is only 1 in 4,000, and it is more common among boys. The occurrence of two SIDS deaths in a family is exceptionally rare. Additionally, the specific medical findings, such as the hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, and physical injuries, are strongly indicative of intentional smothering or other abuse.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS, the consistency of the medical evidence across both cases, and the striking similarities in the circumstances of the deaths, the probability that these events occurred by chance if Jane is not guilty is extremely low.\n\n5%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities and the medical findings is very high. The consistent pattern of infant deaths, the specific medical evidence indicative of smothering or abuse, and the striking similarities between the two incidents would be expected if Jane intentionally caused the deaths of both her children.\n\nGiven the premeditated nature of the alleged crimes and the calculated manner in which they were carried out, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring is extremely likely.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is high:\n- The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\n- The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben\n- The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts\n- The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts\n\nThe new information provided suggests that the medical evidence may not be as conclusive as it initially appeared. The absence of typical smothering injuries, the presence of findings that can occur naturally or due to resuscitation, and the initial misattribution of Andy's injuries all point to the possibility that the deaths may not have been intentional.\n\nGiven these details, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these factors is:\n\n80%",

The lack of such typical smothering injuries, as well as the potential misattribution of Andy's injuries, suggests the medical evidence may not be as conclusive as it initially appeared.\n\nGiven this new information, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these factors is:\n\n20%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence provided, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n65%\n\nThe initial evidence, including the similarities between the two infant deaths, the specific medical findings indicative of smothering or abuse, and the rarity of SIDS occurring in the same family, strongly suggests that Jane may have intentionally caused the deaths of her children.\n\nHowever, the additional information provided, such as the potential misattribution of injuries, the absence of typical smothering evidence, and the alternative explanations for some of the medical findings, introduces reasonable doubt and reduces the likelihood of guilt.\n\nConsidering all the evidence presented, a probability of 65% represents a balanced assessment that Jane's guilt, while plausible, is not conclusively established.",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nNot Guilty"
