  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of all these similarities and findings occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\nThe sudden infant death of two children of the same parents within a short time span is highly unusual, with a probability of less than 1 in 4,000 (the rate of SIDS) for each incident. The similar circumstances, such as the time of day and the fact that Jane was alone with the babies, further increase the improbability of these events occurring by chance.\n\nThe specific medical findings, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages in Ben, as well as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, are strongly indicative of non-accidental injuries and not consistent with natural causes or SIDS. The medical examiner's assessment that the hypoxic damage in Ben was caused shortly before his death also points to an intentional act.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS, the striking similarities between the two incidents, and the medical evidence suggesting non-accidental injuries, the probability that Jane is not guilty is extremely low.\n\n10%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and findings is very high.\n\nThe pattern of two infants dying under similar circumstances, with one child's death being attributed to natural causes and the other exhibiting clear signs of non-accidental injuries, is consistent with a case of filicide (the murder of one's own child).\n\nThe hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages in Ben, as well as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, are all evidence of intentional smothering or other violent acts against the children. The medical examiner's assessment that the hypoxic damage in Ben was caused shortly before his death further supports this.\n\nThe similarities in the timing, location, and Jane's presence alone with the babies when the incidents occurred are also highly indicative of a deliberate pattern of behavior.\n\nGiven the medical evidence and the unusual pattern of events, the probability that these similarities and findings would occur if Jane is guilty is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the additional information provided is relatively high.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, on Ben's body, as well as the lack of observation of the injuries by the hospital staff, suggests that the injuries may have occurred later or been exaggerated during the autopsy.\n\nThe spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case are consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, further casting doubt on the interpretation of these findings as evidence of intentional harm.\n\nAdditionally, the initial attribution of Andy's injuries to the resuscitation attempts is plausible, as such injuries are common in these situations, particularly for a baby.\n\nGiven this additional context, the probability that the injuries found on the children were not present or were misinterpreted if Jane is not guilty is relatively high.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the additional information provided is relatively low.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, on Ben's body, and the lack of observation of the injuries by the hospital staff, would be unusual if Jane had intentionally smothered the child. Smothering typically results in characteristic injuries that should have been noted by medical professionals.\n\nThe spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case, while potentially consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, are also common findings in cases of intentional suffocation or trauma. The medical examiner's assessment that the hypoxic damage was caused shortly before death suggests that these injuries were likely the result of Jane's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the initial attribution of Andy's injuries to the resuscitation attempts may have been an incorrect assessment, as the subsequent re-examination found evidence of abuse and characteristic signs of smothering.\n\nGiven the medical evidence and the pattern of events, the probability that the injuries found on the children were not present or were misinterpreted if Jane is guilty is relatively low.\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n60%",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 60%, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
