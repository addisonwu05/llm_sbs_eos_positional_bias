    "content": "Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of\nthe case:\nAfter Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.\nWhen Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to\nbed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The chances of having two sudden infant deaths in the same family, with similar circumstances and autopsy findings indicative of abuse, would be highly improbable.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which means the probability of it occurring twice in the same family is approximately 1 in 16 million. Additionally, the specific injuries and medical findings observed in the autopsies, such as the hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, and bruises, are highly suggestive of intentional smothering or other violent trauma.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\n5%"

The presence of consistent injuries and medical evidence across both incidents, such as the hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, and bruises, would be highly indicative of a deliberate and repeated pattern of abuse.\n\nThe similarities in the circumstances, including the age of the infants and the timing of the incidents, further suggest a premeditated and calculated approach.
