  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability of the similarities between the two incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very low.\n\nThe likelihood of these events occurring by chance in two separate, natural SIDS cases is extremely unlikely. The forensic evidence, particularly the findings from the re-examination of Andy's autopsy, strongly suggest that the deaths were not due to natural causes but rather the result of intentional actions, such as smothering.\n\nGiven the significant medical and circumstantial evidence against Jane, if she is not guilty, the probability of these similarities and findings would be 5%.\n\n5%",

The forensic findings are highly indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse, which would explain the observed injuries and outcomes.\n\nGiven the compelling evidence against Jane, if she is guilty, the probability of these similarities and findings would be 95%.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is much higher:\n\n- The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\n- The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben\n- The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts\n- The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts\n\nThe additional information provided suggests that the medical evidence may not be as conclusive as initially presented. The lack of certain key injuries associated with smothering, along with plausible alternative explanations for the observed findings, indicates a reasonable possibility that the deaths were not caused by intentional actions.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries and circumstances being as described is 75%.\n\n75%",
