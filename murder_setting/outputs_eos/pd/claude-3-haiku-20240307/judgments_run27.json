  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and findings would be extremely low. The chances of having two sudden infant deaths in the same family, with similar circumstances and autopsy findings indicative of abuse, would be highly improbable.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which means the probability of it occurring twice in the same family is approximately 1 in 16 million. Additionally, the specific injuries and medical findings observed in the autopsies, such as the hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, and bruises, are highly suggestive of intentional smothering or other violent trauma.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\n5%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and findings would be very high. The presence of consistent injuries and medical evidence across both incidents, such as the hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, and bruises, would be highly indicative of a deliberate and repeated pattern of abuse.\n\nThe similarities in the circumstances, including the age of the infants and the timing of the incidents, further suggest a premeditated and calculated approach. Additionally, the specific medical findings, such as the hypoxic brain damage in Ben occurring shortly before death, would be consistent with smothering or other forms of intentional harm.\n\nGiven the strong correlation between the evidence and the allegations of murder, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring is very likely.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, as well as the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation, is quite high.\n\nThe lack of documentation of the injuries on Ben by medical staff, the presence of natural causes of the spinal bleeding and rib dislocation, and the plausible explanation for the injuries found on Andy all suggest that the evidence may not be as conclusive as initially portrayed.\n\nGiven these mitigating factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these explanations being reasonable is high.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben, and the dislocated ribs in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, as well as the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation, is very low.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, it would be highly unlikely that the medical staff would have missed or failed to document such significant injuries on Ben when he was brought in. The absence of petechiae, a telltale sign of smothering, is also suspicious. The plausible explanations for the spinal bleeding and rib dislocations in Ben are less convincing if Jane is truly guilty of intentionally harming the infants.\n\nGiven the strong evidence of abuse and the implausibility of these mitigating factors, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these explanations being reasonable is very low.\n\n15%",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the medical findings indicative of abuse, and the low likelihood of the mitigating factors if the defendant is guilty, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the two counts of murder is:\n\n75%",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 75%, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
