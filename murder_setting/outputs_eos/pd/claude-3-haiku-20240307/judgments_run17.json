  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability of the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely low.\n\nThe specific circumstances described, such as the timing of the deaths, the physical evidence, and the rarity of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) make it highly unlikely that these events occurred by chance if Jane is innocent. The medical evidence, particularly the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, is strongly indicative of smothering or other deliberate trauma.\n\nGiven the improbability of these events occurring together by chance, if Jane is not guilty, the probability is 5%.\n\n5%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability of the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely high.\n\nThe medical evidence, including the timing, location, and nature of the injuries, is highly consistent with Jane intentionally smothering or otherwise harming both of her children. The similarities between the two incidents and the corroborating physical evidence make it very likely that Jane is guilty of the murders.\n\nGiven the strength of the evidence, if Jane is guilty, the probability is 95%.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively high.\n\nThe additional context provided suggests that the injuries observed during the autopsy may not have been indicative of intentional harm. The injuries found on Andy could be explained by the resuscitation attempts, and the injuries on Ben, while present during the autopsy, were not noted by the medical staff when he was initially brought to the hospital. The absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, also casts doubt on the conclusion that the deaths were the result of deliberate asphyxiation.\n\nGiven the new information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these factors is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively low.\n\nThe context provided suggests that the injuries observed during the autopsies, particularly the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben, are strongly indicative of intentional smothering or other deliberate harm. The absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, could be explained by the perpetrator taking care to avoid leaving such obvious signs of their actions.\n\nAdditionally, the similarities between the two incidents and the medical evidence found in the re-examination of Andy's case make it more likely that Jane intentionally harmed both children. If she is guilty, it is less probable that the injuries were not present when the children were first brought to the hospital.\n\nGiven the weight of the evidence, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these factors is 20%.\n\n20%",
