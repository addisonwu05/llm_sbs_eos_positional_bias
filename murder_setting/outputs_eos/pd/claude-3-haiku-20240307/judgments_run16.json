  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low. The frequency of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls. The autopsy findings, especially the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, are more indicative of smothering or other violent trauma rather than natural causes.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is very high. The evidence, including the autopsy findings and the similarities between the two incidents, strongly suggests a pattern of intentional harm and smothering of the infants. Given the medical evidence, a guilty verdict is a very likely outcome.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is relatively high:\n- The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\n- The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\n- The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts\n- The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts\n\nGiven the additional information provided, the medical evidence appears to be more consistent with natural causes or accidental injuries rather than intentional smothering. The absence of typical smothering injuries and the plausible explanations for the observed injuries lend support to the possibility that Jane is not guilty.\n\n80",

The injuries found on the infants, even with the caveats provided, still point to a pattern of intentional harm.\n\n30",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the autopsy findings, and the potential explanations provided, I believe the probability that the defendant (Jane) is guilty is:\n\n60",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 60%, I believe the most appropriate verdict for the defendant Jane is:\n\nGuilty"
