  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of all the observed similarities and evidence being present is extremely low. The coincidence of two infants of similar age dying in the same manner, with the same suspicious physical findings, is highly improbable.\n\nThe hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben's case, as well as the bruises, torn frenulum, and lung bleeding in Andy's case, are all highly indicative of smothering or other non-accidental trauma. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was sustained just prior to his death further reinforces this.\n\nThe rarity of SIDS, especially in two children from the same family, makes it an unlikely explanation for these deaths. The frequency of SIDS being 1 in 4,000 in the UK means the probability of it occurring in this case is extremely low.\n\nGiven the overwhelming medical evidence and the highly improbable coincidence of these two deaths, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n15%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of all the observed similarities and evidence being present is extremely high. The consistent pattern of suspicious physical findings and the timing of the events strongly point to intentional actions by the perpetrator.\n\nThe hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben's case, as well as the bruises, torn frenulum, and lung bleeding in Andy's case, are all highly characteristic of smothering or other forms of intentional suffocation and abuse.\n\nThe doctor's assessment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was sustained just prior to his death corroborates the theory of a deliberate, recent act by the perpetrator.\n\nGiven the overwhelming medical evidence and the clear pattern across the two incidents, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the additional information provided is quite high. The lack of notable injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital, the explanation for the injuries found on Andy, and the common medical findings in Ben's case all suggest that the evidence may not be as conclusive as initially presented.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is significant, as these would be expected in a death due to intentional suffocation. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy can be consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, further casting doubt on the assumption of intentional harm.\n\nGiven this additional context, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the additional information provided is relatively low. The lack of notable injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae, and the explanation for the injuries found on Andy would all be unexpected if Jane had intentionally harmed her children.\n\nThe fact that the dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy could be consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts suggests that the medical evidence may not be as conclusive as it initially seemed. The absence of clear signs of intentional suffocation, such as petechiae, further weakens the case against Jane.\n\nGiven this additional context, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n40%",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n60%",
  "Based on the overall probability of 60% that the defendant is guilty, my verdict is:\n\nGUILTY"
