  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of all these similarities and evidence being present is quite low. The coincidence of two sudden infant deaths of similar nature within a short span is highly unusual, and the specific injuries found in the autopsies are more indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse rather than natural causes.\n\nThe hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused shortly before death, the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, and the overall similarities between the two incidents point strongly towards intentional actions rather than natural causes like SIDS.\n\nGiven the weight of the evidence presented, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and evidence being present is very high. The specific injuries found in the autopsies, such as the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as well as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung of Andy, are highly consistent with intentional smothering or other forms of abuse.\n\nThe fact that both babies were around the same age and died in similar circumstances when Jane was alone with them further strengthens the case against her. The rarity of such incidents occurring naturally, as opposed to being the result of intentional actions, makes the probability of Jane's guilt very high.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following is quite high:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n2. The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben.\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n4. The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe lack of observable injuries on Ben when he was initially brought to the hospital, along with the medical explanations for the injuries found during the autopsy, suggest that these were not the result of intentional smothering. The similarities between the two incidents could potentially be explained by natural causes, such as SIDS, rather than deliberate actions.\n\nGiven the additional context provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the following is relatively low:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n2. The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben.\n3. The dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n4. The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, it is more likely that she would have intentionally concealed or caused the injuries found on Ben, and the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae would be unusual. The medical explanations provided for the dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding in Ben, as well as the injuries found in Andy, seem less plausible if Jane is indeed guilty of intentionally harming her children.\n\nGiven the additional context provided, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\n60%",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 60%, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
