  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents, the specific findings in the autopsies, and the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain is extremely low. The coincidence of two sudden infant deaths within a short span of time, coupled with the physical evidence indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse, would be highly improbable in the absence of foul play.\n\nThe frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which is already a rare occurrence. The similarities between the two cases, the autopsy findings, and the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain make it highly unlikely that these were simply cases of SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these events occurring by chance is 10%.\n\n10%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents, the specific findings in the autopsies, and the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain is extremely high.\n\nThe similarities in the circumstances, the physical evidence of abuse, and the medical findings would all be consistent with a pattern of intentional smothering or other forms of deliberate harm. The fact that these events occurred in a short span of time and involved two children in the same family further increases the probability that they were not isolated incidents.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these events occurring is 95%.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe absence of obvious signs of smothering, the lack of corroborating injuries, and the plausible explanations for the injuries that were found all point to the possibility that these were not intentional acts of harm.\n\nAdditionally, the injuries found on Andy being attributed to the resuscitation attempts further supports the possibility that Jane may not be guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these factors being consistent with her innocence is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae, and the dislocated ribs in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is low.\n\nThe lack of obvious signs of smothering and the plausible explanations for the injuries that were found would be less likely if Jane were guilty of intentionally harming her children. A guilty person would be expected to try to cover their tracks and avoid leaving clear evidence of their actions.\n\nAdditionally, the injuries found on Andy being attributed to the resuscitation attempts may be a more convenient explanation in the case of a guilty person.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these factors being consistent with her innocence is only 20%.\n\n20%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the autopsy findings, and the plausibility of the alternative explanations, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the probabilities I have calculated, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
