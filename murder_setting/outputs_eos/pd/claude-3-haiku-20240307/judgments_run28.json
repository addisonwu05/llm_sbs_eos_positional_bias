  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the observed similarities between the two incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids, and the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy is quite low.\n\nThe sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a well-documented phenomenon that can explain the unexplained deaths of both Andy and Ben. The fact that SIDS is more common among boys, and the timing and circumstances of the two deaths are very similar, suggest that SIDS is a plausible explanation.\n\nAdditionally, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused just hours before his death is not necessarily indicative of smothering or other violent trauma. Infants can experience sudden and unexplained respiratory distress or failure that can lead to hypoxic brain damage in a short timeframe.\n\nThe other injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, could potentially be explained by medical complications or other non-violent factors, especially given the natural cause of death determined in the initial autopsy.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and the specific medical findings is quite low, as SIDS is a more plausible explanation for the unexplained deaths of both children.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the observed similarities between the two incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids, and the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy is very high.\n\nThe similarities in the timing and circumstances of the two deaths, as well as the consistent pattern of injuries, strongly suggest a deliberate and intentional act rather than a natural or accidental cause. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused just hours before his death is indicative of smothering or other violent trauma that can lead to respiratory distress and failure.\n\nThe bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's autopsy are characteristic of smothering and other forms of abuse, which corroborates the hypothesis of intentional harm.\n\nGiven the medical evidence and the pattern of similarities between the two incidents, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these findings is very high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the observed injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, and the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe fact that the injuries on Ben were not noted by the nurses at the hospital suggests that they may have developed or become more apparent later, potentially due to factors unrelated to Jane's actions. The lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, further undermines the hypothesis of intentional suffocation.\n\nAdditionally, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are common findings in natural deaths or can be attributed to resuscitation efforts, rather than being indicative of intentional harm.\n\nSimilarly, the injuries found on Andy during the re-examination of his autopsy could potentially be explained by the resuscitation attempts, as such injuries are consistent with CPR and other emergency procedures.\n\nGiven these mitigating factors, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these observations is quite high.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively low.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of intentionally smothering or harming her children, it is unlikely that the injuries on Ben would not have been present or noticeable when he was first brought to the hospital. The fact that they were only discovered later suggests potential attempts to conceal or obscure the evidence.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, is also somewhat unusual if Jane is indeed guilty. These types of injuries are often associated with suffocation and would be expected to be present if the cause of death was intentional.\n\nThe dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy, while potentially attributable to resuscitation efforts, could also be an indication of intentional harm if Jane is guilty. The presence of these injuries, along with the other findings, raises questions about the true nature of the incidents.\n\nSimilarly, the injuries found on Andy during the re-examination of his autopsy, despite being potentially consistent with resuscitation attempts, could also be indicative of a pattern of abuse or intentional harm if Jane is indeed guilty.\n\nGiven the overall context and the specific medical evidence, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these observations is relatively low.\n\n30%",
