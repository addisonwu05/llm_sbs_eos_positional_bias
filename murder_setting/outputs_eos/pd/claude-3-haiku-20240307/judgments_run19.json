  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and the medical findings is quite low. The combination of the following factors strongly suggests foul play:\n\n1. The similarity in the timing and circumstances of the two infants' deaths when Jane was alone with them.\n2. The presence of hypoxic brain damage, eye hemorrhages, and other injuries in the second child, which are characteristic of smothering.\n3. The additional injuries found in the first child's autopsy after further investigation, which are also indicative of abuse.\n4. The doctor's assessment that the hypoxic brain damage in the second child occurred shortly before death.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the accumulation of evidence pointing to intentional harm, the probability that these events occurred by chance if Jane is innocent is quite low.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents, the medical findings, and the timing of the events are highly likely. A guilty person would likely employ similar methods and act in a consistent manner when committing the same type of crime.\n\nThe presence of the hypoxic brain damage, eye hemorrhages, and other injuries in the second child, as well as the additional evidence of abuse found in the first child's autopsy, are all consistent with a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the accumulation of evidence pointing to deliberate actions, the probability that these events occurred if Jane is guilty is very high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following factors is quite high:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n2. The absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben.\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n4. The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts.\n\nThese factors suggest that the medical evidence may have been misinterpreted or insufficient to conclusively link Jane to the deaths of the children. The absence of clear signs of intentional harm, especially in the case of Ben, raises reasonable doubt about Jane's guilt.\n\nProbability judgment: 80",

The absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben.\n3. The dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n4. The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts.\n\nA guilty person would likely take steps to conceal their actions, such as ensuring that there are no visible signs of abuse when the victims are brought to the hospital. The absence of clear indicators of intentional harm, especially in the case of Ben, would be unusual if Jane were truly guilty.\n\nGiven the other evidence suggesting foul play, the probability that these factors would occur if Jane is guilty is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is:\n\nProbability judgment: 70",
  "Given the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
