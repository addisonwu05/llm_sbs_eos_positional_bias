Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

While hypoxia can occur in SIDS, the specific pattern described (along with hemorrhages) is much more consistent with intentional harm than natural death.\n\n3. **Timing of Ben's brain damage**: The assertion that damage occurred \"hours before death\" suggests a deliberate act rather than sudden natural death.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries found on re-examination**: Bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs are characteristic signs of physical abuse and smothering. These findings are extremely unlikely to occur naturally or be missed initially if they were from natural causes.\n\n5. **Two deaths in one family**: While two SIDS deaths can occur in one family, the statistical probability is extremely low (approximately 1 in 16,000,000 based on the 1 in 4,000 rate).\n\nThe combination of:\n- Multiple specific traumatic injuries consistent with abuse\n- Hypoxic damage with specific timing\n- Two deaths with this evidence pattern\n- The medical expert opinion linking these findings to smothering\n\nmakes it extremely unlikely this evidence would exist if Jane were not guilty.\n\n15"

Oxygen deprivation causes hypoxic brain damage, and the physical force involved in smothering commonly causes hemorrhages around the eyes and eyelids.\n\n3. **Timing of Ben's brain damage occurring hours before death**: This fits with a scenario where Jane inflicted harm that led to brain damage, with death following hours later - consistent with the timeline of smothering injuries.\n\n4. **Andy's traumatic injuries**: Bruises to arms and legs (from restraining/holding down), torn frenulum (from covering mouth/forcing objects), and blood in lungs (from smothering) are all highly characteristic and expected findings in smothering cases.\n\n5. **Pattern consistency**: If guilty, Jane would use the same method both times, explaining why both children show similar evidence of smothering-related trauma.\n\nAll the physical evidence aligns perfectly with what medical experts would expect to find in cases of infant smothering. The injuries are textbook presentations of this type of abuse, and the similarities reflect a consistent modus operandi.\n\n95"

If Jane is not guilty, this explanation is medically sound and was the original professional assessment.\n\nThis additional context significantly changes the interpretation - it suggests the injuries have plausible alternative explanations (resuscitation, post-mortem changes, natural death processes) and that some expected signs of intentional smothering (like petechiae) were absent.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty and both deaths were natural, these findings would be quite consistent with that scenario.\n\n75"

Medical professionals are trained to identify signs of abuse, especially in infant deaths.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: Petechiae are very common findings in smothering cases due to increased pressure and broken capillaries. If Jane smothered Ben, the absence of this typical indicator is unexpected and inconsistent with the typical presentation of smothering.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: While these could occur during smothering, they're also easily explained by resuscitation attempts. If Jane is guilty, having injuries that are readily attributable to medical intervention rather than showing clear signs of intentional harm is somewhat fortunate for concealing guilt.\n\n4. **Andy's injuries**: If Jane smothered Andy, it would be quite fortunate that the injuries were initially dismissed as resuscitation-related by medical professionals, allowing the death to be classified as natural causes initially.\n\nThe pattern suggests that if Jane were guilty, the physical evidence is remarkably subtle and easily explained by other causes, lacking many of the typical clear indicators that medical experts usually find in smothering cases.\n\n25"
