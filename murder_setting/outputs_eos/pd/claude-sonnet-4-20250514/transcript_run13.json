Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The probability would be approximately (1/4,000)² = 1 in 16,000,000, though there may be some genetic predisposition that could increase this slightly.\n\n2. **Similarities between incidents**: The timing similarities (same age, time of day, after feeding, found by Jane when alone) could occur naturally with SIDS, as there are known patterns to SIDS occurrences.\n\n3. **Ben's specific injuries**: \n   - Hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death\n   - Rib and spinal cord injuries\n   - Eye and eyelid hemorrhages\n   These findings are highly unusual for SIDS and strongly suggest trauma/abuse.\n\n4. **Andy's re-examined evidence**:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs\n   - Torn frenulum\n   - Blood in lungs\n   These are classic signs of physical abuse/smothering, not typical of SIDS.\n\n5. **Medical expert testimony**: The doctor's assertion that Ben's hypoxic damage \"must have been caused hours before death\" suggests intentional harm rather than sudden natural death.\n\nThe combination of two infant deaths with clear physical trauma indicators, in circumstances where the defendant was alone with both children, occurring in very similar patterns, makes the natural causes explanation extremely unlikely.\n\nThe physical evidence of trauma in both cases is the most compelling factor against innocence.\n\n5"

This creates a consistent pattern that would be highly likely.\n\n2. **Ben's specific medical findings**:\n   - Hypoxic brain damage hours before death: Highly consistent with prolonged smothering/suffocation\n   - Rib and spinal cord injuries: Consistent with forceful restraint during smothering\n   - Eye and eyelid hemorrhages: Classic signs of asphyxiation/smothering\n\n3. **Andy's trauma evidence**:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs: Consistent with forceful restraint during attack\n   - Torn frenulum: Classic indicator of smothering (covering mouth/nose forcefully)\n   - Blood in lungs: Consistent with asphyxiation trauma\n\n4. **Timing of hypoxic damage**: The medical evidence that Ben's brain damage occurred hours before death is entirely consistent with a deliberate smothering attack that caused prolonged oxygen deprivation.\n\n5. **Pattern consistency**: Both children showing physical trauma consistent with the same method of killing demonstrates a repeated modus operandi.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering both children, all of these findings would be expected and highly consistent with that scenario.
