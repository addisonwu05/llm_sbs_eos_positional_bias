Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me consider each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Two infant deaths in the same family**: While tragic, this can occur naturally. SIDS has a rate of 1 in 4,000, so two SIDS deaths in one family, while rare, is possible.\n\n2. **Similar circumstances** (same ages, times, Jane alone): These could be coincidental patterns in care routines.\n\n3. **Ben's hypoxic brain damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages**: These are strongly associated with smothering/violent trauma. While some natural conditions might cause hypoxia, the combination with hemorrhages is very concerning.\n\n4. **Ben's hypoxic damage occurring hours before death**: This suggests an intentional act rather than sudden natural death.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries found on re-examination**: Bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and lung blood are highly indicative of physical abuse and smothering. These findings are very difficult to explain through natural causes.\n\n6. **The specific combination**: The torn frenulum (often from forced feeding/smothering), multiple bruises, lung blood, hypoxic brain damage, and eye hemorrhages together form a pattern extremely unlikely to occur naturally in two separate incidents.\n\nWhile individual elements might have innocent explanations, the combination of all these specific medical findings across both children, particularly the clear signs of physical trauma and abuse, would be extraordinarily unlikely if Jane were not guilty.\n\n5"
