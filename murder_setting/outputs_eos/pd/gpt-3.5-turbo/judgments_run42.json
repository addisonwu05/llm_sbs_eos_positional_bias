  "Given the specific similarities and consistent evidence found in both cases, the probability that these incidents are not related and that Jane is not guilty would be very low. Therefore, the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain, and the other physical evidence in Andy's case being unrelated is **5**.",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that the similarities between both incidents, including the specific injuries and evidence found in both cases, would be present. Therefore, the likelihood of these similarities being present in both incidents if Jane is guilty is **95**.",
  "Given the lack of typical injuries characteristic of smothering in Ben's case, the absence of injuries noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, and the explanation that the injuries found on Ben may have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, the probability that Jane is not guilty and these specific injury findings were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital as well as the absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben and Andy is **80**.",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben, and the dislocated ribs found in Ben would all be consistent with smothering. Therefore, the probability that Jane is guilty and these specific injury findings were present when Ben was brought to the hospital, as well as the absence of typical injuries like petechiae and the presence of dislocated ribs in Ben, is **90**.",
  "Based on the given evidence, including the consistent injuries found in both cases, the similarities between the incidents, and the lack of alternative explanations for the findings, the probability that the defendant Jane is guilty is **95**.",
  "Guilty"
