  "Given the similarities between both incidents, the consistent evidence of smothering and abuse in both cases, and the doctor's assessment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance in both incidents is very low. \n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is 5.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is very high. The consistent evidence of smothering and abuse in both cases, along with the doctor's assessment that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused shortly before his death, suggests a pattern of intentional harm inflicted on both children by Jane.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is 95.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs which could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy were due to the initial belief that they were caused by resuscitation attempts, is moderate.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is 40.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of dislocated ribs in Ben possibly due to post-mortem occurrences or resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy were intentionally inflicted is high.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is 85.",
  "Given the evidence presented, including the consistent injuries found in both children, the doctor's assessment of the injuries being indicative of abuse and smothering, and the similarities between both incidents, the probability that the defendant is guilty is high.\n\nTherefore, the probability judgment is 90.",
  "Guilty"
