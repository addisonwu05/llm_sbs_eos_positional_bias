  "Without additional information, it is difficult to accurately determine the probability of Jane being not guilty in this case based on the similarities between both incidents and the specific details of Ben's injuries. However, considering the evidence presented, including the similarities between the incidents and the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, the probability of Jane being not guilty may be low. Given the extensive evidence pointing towards smothering in both cases, the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance is slim.\n\nProbability Judgement: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, including the specific injuries and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Andy and Ben, would be high. Given the consistency in the pattern of injuries and the circumstances in which the babies were found, it suggests a deliberate act rather than coincidence.\n\nProbability Judgement: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy could be high. The discrepancies in the documentation of injuries between Ben and Andy, as well as the absence of specific indicators of smothering in Ben, could support the argument that the deaths were not due to deliberate harm.\n\nProbability Judgement: 80",
