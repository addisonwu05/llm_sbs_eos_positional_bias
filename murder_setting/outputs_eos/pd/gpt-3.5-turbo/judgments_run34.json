  "There is a very low probability (1%) of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty. These findings strongly point towards the likelihood of Jane being involved in the deaths of both children through smothering and abuse.",
  "If Jane is guilty, there is a very high probability (99%) of these similarities occurring between both incidents. The evidence strongly suggests a pattern of abuse and smothering in both cases.",
  "If Jane is not guilty, there is a 5% probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding, and dislocated ribs found in Ben were not indicative of smothering. The injuries found in Andy were likely due to resuscitation attempts.",
  "If Jane is guilty, there is a 90% probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy are all indicative of smothering and abuse in both cases.",
