  "The similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, and the presence of the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as well as the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, make it highly unlikely for Jane to be NOT GUILTY.
