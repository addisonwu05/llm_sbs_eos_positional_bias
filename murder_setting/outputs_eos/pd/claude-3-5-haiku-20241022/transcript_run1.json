Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Two babies dying at similar ages (around 8-11 weeks) and under similar circumstances:\n- Natural occurrence of SIDS is 1 in 4,000\n- Two such occurrences happening in the same family would be astronomically rare\n- Statistically, this is extremely unlikely by chance\n\n2. Medical findings in both cases:\n- Ben's autopsy showed clear signs of potential trauma (hypoxic damage, eye hemorrhages)\n- Andy's re-examination revealed bruising and internal injuries consistent with smothering\n- These specific medical findings being purely coincidental is extremely improbable\n\n3. Circumstantial similarities:\n- Both deaths occurred when Jane was alone with the baby\n- Both happened shortly after feeding\n- Both babies found unconscious by Jane\n\nEach of these factors independently suggests an extremely low probability of these being random, unrelated incidents.\n\nThe combination of:\n- Extremely rare double infant death\n- Consistent medical trauma indicators\n- Identical circumstantial conditions\n\nSuggests that these deaths are highly unlikely to be natural or coincidental.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these incidents are NOT the result of intentional harm is extremely low.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"
