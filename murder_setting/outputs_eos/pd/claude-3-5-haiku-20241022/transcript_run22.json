Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Specific medical findings in Ben's case (hypoxic brain damage, eye hemorrhages)\n5. Specific medical findings in Andy's re-examined case (bruises, torn frenulum, lung blood)\n\nStatistical considerations:\n- SIDS frequency is 1 in 4,000\n- Two independent SIDS deaths in one family would be extremely rare\n- The specific medical findings are not typical of natural SIDS\n- The consistent circumstances of both deaths (time, Jane's presence) are statistically improbable\n\nWhile absolute certainty is impossible, the convergence of these highly specific and unusual factors strongly suggests these are not coincidental events.\n\nThe combination of:\n- Repeated infant deaths\n- Identical circumstances\n- Non-standard medical findings\n- Consistent maternal presence\n\nSuggests an extremely low probability of these being natural deaths.\n\nProbability judgment (0-100): 95"
