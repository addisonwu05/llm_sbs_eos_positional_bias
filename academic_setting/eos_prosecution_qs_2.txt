If Lena did commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 across several analyses, the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, an earlier analysis script had participants who were not included in the final dataset, and those participants would later be excluded in the final dataset, and would write in emails that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her career prospects, and that she “needs this one to work”?
