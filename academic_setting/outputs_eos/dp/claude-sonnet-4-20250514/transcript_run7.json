    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students in the lab during a lab-wide robustness exploration - this would be very common and expected behavior in legitimate research practices.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission - this is standard practice for data quality control in cognitive neuroscience studies.\n\n3.

Two participants excluded with notes predating submission - If committing misconduct, she could have fabricated these exclusion notes retroactively, but having them predate submission with legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding) suggests either genuine exclusions or very sophisticated planning.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hardware failure - These external, verifiable events would be fortunate cover for someone committing misconduct, as they provide plausible explanations for missing files and inconsistencies.\n\n4. Prior clean audit record - Someone committing misconduct could have started dishonest practices after previously legitimate work, especially under increased pressure for this high-profile study.\n\nWhile some of these elements could provide convenient cover for misconduct, the combination of all these factors occurring together - particularly the external verification of technical issues and the pattern matching other students - would be quite fortuitous for someone trying to hide misconduct.\n\n25"

Earlier analysis script with additional participants later excluded - This could happen legitimately through proper data cleaning procedures, though it raises questions about the exclusion rationale.\n\n3. Preregistration modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - This is a serious deviation from proper research protocol. While there could be legitimate reasons for minor modifications, changing both exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-data collection is highly irregular in honest research.\n\n4. Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several analyses - This pattern is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally and is a classic red flag for p-hacking or data manipulation. The probability of this happening by chance across multiple analyses is extremely low.\n\nThe combination of these factors, particularly the suspicious p-value distribution and post-hoc preregistration changes, would be highly improbable in legitimate research.\n\n5"
