    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is described as part of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" with other students showing similar patterns. This would be very likely (90-95%) in a legitimate research environment focused on robust methodology.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with pre-submission notes: These are common, legitimate exclusions in cognitive studies, and the notes predating submission provide strong documentation. This would be very likely (90-95%) in honest research.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, making this a documented fact rather than a claim. Software transitions in academic labs are also common. This would be very likely (85-90%) as these are routine technical issues.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data passing independent audit: If Lena is conducting honest research, her consistent track record would be expected. This would be very likely (90-95%) for a researcher with good practices.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are highly consistent with legitimate research practices and normal lab operations. The combination of robust methodology exploration, standard participant exclusions with proper documentation, confirmed technical issues, and a strong prior track record creates a coherent picture of honest research.\n\n88"

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence assuming Lena did commit misconduct:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: If Lena committed misconduct, she would likely try to hide it rather than create obvious evidence of data manipulation. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this is normal lab practice, not misconduct. This evidence would be moderately likely (60-70%) even if she committed misconduct, as it could provide cover.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with pre-submission notes: If fabricating data, creating legitimate-looking exclusions with backdated documentation would be a sophisticated cover-up strategy. However, these appear to be genuine exclusions with proper documentation. This would be somewhat likely (50-60%) if she were trying to create a convincing facade.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure: The IT-confirmed hardware failure is independently verified and cannot be fabricated. If committing misconduct, this would be extremely convenient timing to explain missing evidence. The probability of such convenient timing would be low (20-30%).\n\n4. Prior record of clean data passing independent audit: If Lena is capable of misconduct now, having a clean prior record suggests either: she recently started misconduct, she was previously more careful, or the prior audit missed issues. This would be moderately likely (40-60%) as misconduct often escalates under pressure.\n\nThe combination of independently verified technical failures occurring at convenient times, along with sophisticated documentation that would require premeditation, makes this overall pattern less likely if misconduct occurred.\n\n25"
