    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - This is presented as a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" with other students showing similar patterns. If this was genuinely a lab protocol, this would be very likely to occur in legitimate research.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with pre-submission notes - These are common, legitimate reasons for exclusion in cognitive studies, and the timing (before submission) supports proper methodology.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure - The IT department independently confirmed the hardware failure, making this verifiable. Software transitions in academic labs are also common and reasonable.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit - This establishes a baseline of proper research conduct and careful methodology.\n\nEach of these elements individually represents normal academic research practices and circumstances. The combination, while creating some complexity that could appear suspicious to outsiders, reflects typical challenges and procedures in academic research labs. The key factors are that the exclusions were documented before results were known, the lab had established protocols for robustness testing, technical issues were independently verified, and there's a proven track record of proper conduct.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - If committing misconduct, she would likely try to hide evidence of data manipulation, not create extensive logs showing multiple analyses. However, these logs could provide cover by making selective reporting look like normal robustness testing.\n\n2. Participant exclusions with pre-submission notes - If fabricating data, she could have backdated these notes or created false documentation to appear legitimate. However, this requires significant premeditation and sophistication.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure - The hardware failure is independently verified by IT, making it genuine. A software switch mid-project, while inconvenient for misconduct, could actually provide cover for inconsistencies in files and analysis trails.\n\n4. Prior clean audit record - Someone committing misconduct might have a previously clean record, especially if this represents escalating pressure or a first-time offense. However, it suggests established competence in proper data handling.\n\nThe combination presents mixed implications for misconduct. While some elements (like extensive documentation and verified technical issues) seem inconsistent with typical data fabrication, they could also serve as sophisticated cover. The prior clean record and legitimate participant exclusions suggest either innocence or very calculated misconduct designed to appear routine.\n\n35"
