    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Let's evaluate how well the given evidence aligns with Alex's innocence:\n\n1. **Timing evidence**: Alex badging out 7 minutes before the critical error is very consistent with innocence - it would be highly unlikely for someone to leave the building just minutes after deliberately breaking equipment.\n\n2. **Alternative suspect**: Jamie's forceful handling of jammed paper provides a plausible alternative explanation for the damage, especially given that forced paper removal can cause mechanical failures.\n\n3. **Known defect pattern**: The documented history of this printer model failing similarly in other departments without improper handling strongly suggests an inherent mechanical weakness rather than user-caused damage.\n\n4. **Alex's proactive behavior**: The prior email warning about grinding noise and pattern of responsible equipment reporting is entirely consistent with someone who cares about office equipment rather than someone who would damage it.\n\n5. **Early warning**: Alex's specific prediction that the printer \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real\" suggests genuine concern about impending mechanical failure rather than planning sabotage.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align very well with Alex's innocence and provide compelling alternative explanations for the printer failure. The combination of Alex being absent when the failure occurred, another person handling the printer forcefully, known mechanical defects, and Alex's responsible reporting pattern creates a highly coherent innocent explanation.\n\n92"

A guilty person would more likely either stay to appear innocent or leave much earlier to create distance from the incident.\n\n2. **Jamie's actions**: While Jamie's forceful paper handling could provide cover for Alex's sabotage, it would be quite coincidental for Alex to benefit from this alternative explanation if he were actually guilty.\n\n3. **Known defect pattern**: If Alex broke the printer, it would be remarkably convenient that this specific model has a documented history of identical failures in other departments. This creates reasonable doubt that would be lucky for a guilty Alex.\n\n4. **Proactive reporting**: If Alex planned to break the printer, sending a warning email three days earlier would be an unusually sophisticated false flag operation. Most people who damage equipment don't create such elaborate cover stories in advance.\n\n5. **Pattern of responsible behavior**: A history of promptly reporting equipment problems would be inconsistent with someone who damages office equipment, unless Alex is exceptionally manipulative.\n\nThe combination of Alex leaving just minutes before the failure, having such convenient alternative explanations available, and his proactive warning behavior would represent either extraordinary bad luck in timing or an unusually sophisticated cover-up operation.\n\n15"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.
