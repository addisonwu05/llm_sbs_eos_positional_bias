    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students in a lab-wide robustness exploration - this would be very likely (90-95%) as it represents standard good practice encouraged by the lab.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission - this would be quite likely (80-85%) as these are common issues in cognitive studies and proper documentation is standard practice.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure - software switches happen regularly in academic labs (70-80% likelihood), and hard drive failures are common technical issues that IT confirmed occurred (80-85% likelihood).\n\n4. Prior clean record with well-documented data passing independent audit - if she didn't commit misconduct, having a good prior record would be very likely (85-90%) as it suggests consistent ethical practices.\n\nThe combination of all these factors occurring together in an innocent scenario involves some coincidental timing (particularly the hard drive failure during an investigation period), but each individual element is quite plausible for a diligent researcher. The evidence pattern is more consistent with normal research practices and unfortunate timing than with fabrication.\n\n75"

Prior clean record with documented data passing audit - someone planning misconduct might have been careful previously to build credibility, or this could represent a first-time lapse under pressure (50-60% likelihood of maintaining clean record before misconduct).\n\nThe combination becomes more suspicious when viewed through a misconduct lens - the hard drive failure conveniently destroying evidence, the ability to point to \"normal\" analysis exploration, and having plausible exclusions already documented.
