    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

    "content": "Three days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The timing particularly supports this - Alex left before the critical error occurred. His proactive email about the grinding noise three days earlier shows responsible behavior, not someone planning to damage equipment. The documented history of identical failures in other departments suggests this was likely a mechanical defect rather than user-caused damage.\n\nThe evidence forms a coherent pattern that strongly supports the scenario where Alex did not cause the breakdown.\n\n92"

    "content": "Looking at this evidence through the lens of whether Alex did break the printer:\n\nIf Alex broke the printer, several aspects of this evidence would be quite unusual or contradictory:\n\n- The 7-minute gap between his departure and the critical error is problematic - if he damaged it, why didn't it fail immediately?\n- His proactive email about the grinding noise three days earlier would be strange behavior for someone planning to damage equipment\n- His consistent pattern of responsible reporting contradicts intentionally destructive behavior\n- The existence of identical failures in other departments due to known defects provides an alternative explanation that doesn't require Alex's involvement\n- Jamie's forceful handling offers another potential cause\n\nWhile it's theoretically possible Alex could have damaged the printer in a way that caused delayed failure, or that he was being deceptively helpful with his earlier reporting, this combination of evidence would be quite unlikely if he were actually responsible for the breakdown. The timing alone makes it improbable, and the other factors further reduce the likelihood that this evidence pattern would occur if Alex were guilty.\n\n25"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The timing and physical evidence (fragments in his trash) would be very unfortunate coincidences if he were innocent.
