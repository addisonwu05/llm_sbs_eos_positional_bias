    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

However, the fact that other students show identical patterns suggests this was genuine lab-wide practice rather than cover for misconduct.\n\nThe participant exclusions with pre-dating notes could be legitimate exclusions that occurred regardless, or potentially fabricated notes if someone was planning ahead, though backdating documentation would require additional deceptive steps.\n\nThe most problematic element is her clean prior record. While people can change behavior, having well-documented data that passed independent audit suggests consistent good practices that would make sudden misconduct less characteristic, though not impossible.\n\nSomeone committing misconduct might still experience normal technical problems and follow some proper procedures while manipulating other aspects of their data. The lab-wide analysis patterns and external technical events would still occur, but the combination of ALL these legitimizing factors appearing together when misconduct is occurring would be somewhat coincidental.\n\n35"
