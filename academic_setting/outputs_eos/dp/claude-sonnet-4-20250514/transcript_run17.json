    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex previously reporting problems and having a pattern of responsible equipment reporting would be very likely - this suggests someone who cares about equipment maintenance rather than someone who would damage it.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align well with Alex's innocence. The timing evidence suggests he wasn't there when the final failure occurred, there's an alternative suspect (Jamie) with documented forceful handling, there's a known mechanical defect pattern, and Alex's history suggests responsible behavior rather than destructive tendencies.\n\nThese facts form a coherent picture that would be expected if Alex were not responsible for breaking the printer.\n\n85"

Alex badging out 7 minutes before the critical error would be somewhat unlikely - if he broke it, the error would more likely occur immediately or while he was still there. However, it's possible he damaged it and it took time to fully fail.\n\n2. Jamie pulling forcefully on jammed paper earlier would still be reasonably likely - this could be coincidental or Alex could have exploited existing damage Jamie caused.\n\n3. The printer model having a documented history of similar failures would be moderately likely - Alex might have intentionally exploited a known weakness, or this could be coincidental.\n\n4. Alex previously reporting problems and having a pattern of responsible equipment reporting would be somewhat unlikely if he's guilty - it would suggest either sophisticated planning (reporting problems to avoid suspicion before breaking it) or that his character assessment is inconsistent with the destructive act.\n\nWhile some of this evidence could still occur if Alex were guilty (coincidences happen, and guilty parties sometimes try to appear helpful), the combination creates tension with the guilt hypothesis. The timing evidence particularly suggests he wasn't present for the final failure, and his responsible reporting pattern conflicts with deliberately destructive behavior.\n\n25"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

While individual pieces might be explained by coincidence, the convergence of multiple suspicious elements significantly reduces the likelihood of innocence.\n\n15"
