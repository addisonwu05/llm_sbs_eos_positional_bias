    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students - This appears to be standard lab practice as part of a lab-wide robustness exploration initiative. Very likely in an innocent scenario.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with pre-submission notes - These are legitimate, documented exclusions made before any submission pressure. The reasons are common and reasonable in cognitive studies.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure - Both events are independently documented by the lab and IT department. Hardware failures are common occurrences.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit - This establishes a pattern of proper research conduct and good data management practices.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only consistent with innocent conduct, but several represent standard research practices (multiple analyses for robustness, legitimate participant exclusions, documented software transitions) or common technical issues (hardware failure). The prior clean audit record particularly supports a pattern of proper conduct.\n\nThese events collectively form a coherent picture of normal research operations with some typical technical challenges, rather than evidence of misconduct.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students - If this is standard lab practice documented across multiple students, it would still occur regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct. The lab-wide initiative predates any misconduct.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with pre-submission notes - If Lena fabricated or manipulated data, she would likely still need to exclude genuinely problematic participants to maintain credibility. These appear to be legitimate exclusions that would occur even with misconduct elsewhere in the dataset.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure - These are externally documented events independent of Lena's actions. The lab switch affects everyone, and the IT department confirms the hardware failure. These would occur regardless of misconduct.\n\n4. Prior clean audit record - This is the most challenging piece for a misconduct scenario. However, misconduct could develop due to new pressures (high-profile study, grant pressure, career stage), or could represent sophisticated misconduct that began after the audit.\n\nMost of these pieces of evidence represent either standard practices, legitimate research decisions, or independently documented technical events that would occur regardless of whether misconduct happened in the data analysis phase. The prior clean record is somewhat inconsistent with misconduct but not impossible given changed circumstances and pressure.\n\n65"

Post-hoc changes to preregistration after seeing the data, especially to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, strongly suggests intentional manipulation to achieve desired results.\n\n3.
