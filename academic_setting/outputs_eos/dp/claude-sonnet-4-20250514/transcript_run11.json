    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: This is very likely (90-95%) as it reflects normal exploratory data analysis practices, especially during a lab-wide robustness exploration initiative.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with pre-submission notes: This is quite likely (80-85%) as these are common issues in cognitive experiments that researchers routinely document and exclude.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: The software switch is moderately likely (70%) as labs do upgrade systems, and the hard drive failure is less common but still plausible (20-30%) for any individual laptop over a project timeline.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data passing independent audit: This is very likely (85-90%) to continue if she maintains the same careful practices.\n\nThe combination of all four events occurring together in an innocent scenario involves some interdependence - a researcher with good prior practices is more likely to handle exclusions properly and follow lab protocols. The hardware issues and software changes are somewhat independent but represent normal operational challenges labs face.\n\nConsidering the overall constellation of evidence, this pattern is quite consistent with normal research practices and unfortunate but explicable technical difficulties.\n\n78"
