    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This would require either delayed failure from his actions or manipulation of the access logs, both of which reduce the likelihood.\n\nThe security footage of Jamie's forceful handling earlier that afternoon could still occur even if Alex later broke it, but it provides alternative explanations that complicate a clear attribution to Alex.\n\nThe documented history of this printer model failing due to defective fuser units in other departments could still exist even if Alex broke this particular one, though it makes mechanical failure a competing explanation.\n\nAlex's proactive email warning about grinding noises three days earlier is puzzling if he intended to break the printer - why draw attention to problems beforehand? This seems counterintuitive for someone planning destructive actions.\n\nAlex's established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems conflicts with the theory that he would break equipment, though people can act inconsistently.\n\nThe strongest challenge to Alex's guilt is the timing evidence - being absent when the critical error occurred makes it difficult to establish direct causation. The prior warning email also seems inconsistent with destructive intent.\n\n25"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

While possible if innocent, this timing is problematic.\n\nThe initial denial of using the printer followed by uncertain correction suggests potential deception or memory issues. If innocent, why initially deny printer use entirely before backtracking?\n\nThe noon chat message saying \"if it does this one more time I'm going to lose it\" establishes clear frustration and could be seen as escalating toward action. While this could be innocent venting, it creates a concerning narrative arc.\n\nThe plastic fragments in Alex's trash can that appear similar to the broken tray pieces are highly suspicious. If Alex didn't break it, why would these fragments be there? While there could be innocent explanations (cleaning up existing debris), this is difficult to explain away.\n\nThe combination of being the last person near the printer, initially lying about printer use, expressing escalating frustration, and having physical evidence in their workspace creates a very challenging set of coincidences for innocence.\n\nEach piece individually might have innocent explanations, but together they form a pattern that would be quite unlikely if Alex were truly innocent.\n\n15"
