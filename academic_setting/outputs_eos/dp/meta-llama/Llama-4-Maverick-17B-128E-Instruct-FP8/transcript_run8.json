    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the key elements presented:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is in line with good research practice, especially in the context of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. It indicates a thorough and transparent approach to data analysis. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's plausible she was following lab practices.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on predefined criteria with notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a reasonable practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known, which supports the integrity of the process.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena experiencing a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events that can happen in the course of research. They provide a mundane explanation for some of the irregularities or missing files that might have raised suspicions.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This history suggests that Lena is capable of handling data responsibly and following best practices. It supports the notion that she might not have intentionally manipulated data in the study under investigation.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would be following lab practices by running multiple analysis scripts.\n- She would exclude participants based on valid reasons documented before the submission.\n- The lab would experience technical issues like software changes and hardware failures.\n- She would have a history of good data management practices.\n\nTherefore, given that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is fairly likely that the described events and findings would occur as they align with good research practices and plausible unfortunate events.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the elements presented:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this could be a genuine practice, a researcher committing misconduct might also do this to cover their tracks or to make it seem like they explored various analyses. However, it is less clear how this directly relates to misconduct unless it's part of an attempt to justify or obscure the actual analysis used.\n\n2. **Excluding participants with valid reasons and documentation predating journal submission**: This suggests that at least some of the data handling practices were legitimate and not tampered with after the fact for the purposes of the publication. A researcher committing misconduct might still follow proper exclusion procedures for some participants to maintain a veneer of legitimacy.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena experiencing a hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such lab or technical issues.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A researcher who commits misconduct in one study might still have a history of proper data handling in previous studies. Misconduct can be a deviation from one's usual behavior.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the described events could still occur. The actions that seem to indicate good practice or unfortunate events (like the hard drive failure) don't directly contradict the possibility of misconduct in this specific instance. However, the presence of these factors might suggest an attempt to appear diligent or to coincidentally benefit from unrelated events.\n\nGiven the mixed implications of these factors, it's still relatively plausible that they could occur even if Lena committed misconduct, as some are unrelated to the misconduct directly (e.g., lab software change, hard drive failure) and others could be part of an effort to maintain a facade of good research practice.\n\n40"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's examine the elements presented:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc adjustments to the analysis plan based on the results. Modifying it after data collection could indicate an attempt to justify analyses that were chosen after seeing the data, which is a form of misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be unlikely for her to modify the preregistration document in such a manner without a valid, non-suspicious reason.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: While this could be due to legitimate reasons such as applying exclusion criteria, it could also be seen as suspicious if those exclusions were not pre-specified or justified. If Lena didn't commit misconduct, this could still happen due to legitimate changes in analysis plans, but the context (like whether the exclusions were justified and pre-specified) is crucial.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: While these emails suggest that Lena had a vested interest in the study's success, they do not directly imply misconduct. Researchers often have stakes in their projects, but this doesn't necessarily lead to unethical behavior.\n\nConsidering these points, the combination of an unusual distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection are particularly suspicious and less likely if Lena did not commit misconduct. The presence of these factors, especially the alteration of the preregistration document, makes the scenario less plausible under the assumption of no misconduct.\n\n5"

These directly suggest possible manipulation or p-hacking, which are serious forms of academic misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena's emails indicating pressure and a desire for success provide a motive, they do not directly prove misconduct.
