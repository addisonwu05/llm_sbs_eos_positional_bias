    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information provided step by step:\n\n1. **Lena's Prior Record**: Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling, and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit. This suggests that she is capable of handling data properly and that any irregularities in the current study might not be due to her intentional actions.\n\n2. **Lab's Data Management Logs**: The lab's data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria. This behavior is similar to that of other students in the lab, as part of a lab-wide effort to explore robustness. This indicates that her actions were likely in line with lab practices and not indicative of misconduct.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: Two participants were excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes in the raw data files that predate the journal submission. This suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known, which supports the notion that the exclusion was based on genuine reasons rather than an attempt to manipulate the data.\n\n4. **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab switched statistical software packages halfway through the project, and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure, leading to some file loss. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure. These events provide plausible explanations for any discrepancies or irregularities in the data and analysis.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have a clean record and well-documented data in earlier studies, as it is consistent with her past behavior.\n- The lab's data management logs would show her running multiple analysis scripts, as this was a lab-wide practice.\n- Participants would be excluded based on legitimate reasons that were documented before the journal submission.\n- The lab would experience a software switch and a hard drive failure, which are unfortunate but possible events in a research setting.\n\nConsidering these factors, the scenario described is quite likely if Lena did not commit misconduct because it aligns with her previous behavior, common lab practices, and the presence of plausible explanations for any irregularities.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information:\n\n1. **Lena's Prior Record and Behavior of Other Students**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's still possible she had a clean record before and that her actions in the current study were aberrant. The fact that other students also ran multiple analysis scripts doesn't directly relate to Lena's potential misconduct but suggests it was a common practice.\n\n2. **Exclusion of Participants and Documentation**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons (e.g., falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes predating the journal submission could be a genuine practice. However, someone committing misconduct might also fabricate such reasons and documentation to make their actions appear legitimate.\n\n3. **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of Lena's actions. A lab software switch is a common occurrence as labs continually update their methods and tools. A hard drive failure is an unfortunate but plausible event.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, several of the observed facts could still occur:\n- Running multiple scripts could be part of her attempting to find a favorable analysis, but it's also a common practice in the lab.\n- Documenting reasons for excluding participants before journal submission could be fabricated to cover her tracks.\n- A software switch and hard drive failure are independent of her actions.\n\nHowever, the fact that she had a prior clean record might suggest that the misconduct, if it occurred, was a one-time event or an aberration rather than a habitual behavior.\n\nGiven that some of these events are unrelated to misconduct (like the lab switching software and the hard drive failure) and others could be fabricated or coincidental, it's not entirely implausible that they could occur even if Lena committed misconduct.\n\n30"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information:\n\n1. **Pressure and Motivation**: Lena's emails indicate she felt pressure due to her supervisor's reliance on the study for the grant and her own career prospects. This pressure could potentially influence her actions, but it doesn't directly imply misconduct unless accompanied by other suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's possible these changes were made for legitimate reasons (e.g., realizing the initial plan wasn't optimal after seeing the data). However, modifying a preregistration document after data collection is generally considered bad practice and raises suspicions.\n\n3. **P-value Distribution**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05. This could be a result of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation if misconduct occurred. If Lena did not commit misconduct, a natural distribution of p-values might be expected, but certain analyses or datasets could coincidentally show such a pattern.\n\n4. **Changes in Analysis Script and Participant Exclusion**: An earlier version of the analysis script included additional participants later excluded from the final dataset. This could indicate either a legitimate refinement of the analysis plan or an attempt to manipulate the results.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- Feeling pressure and expressing it in emails is plausible and doesn't necessarily indicate misconduct.\n- Modifying a preregistration document after data collection is suspicious and generally considered improper, even if not necessarily misconduct.\n- An unusual distribution of p-values could be coincidental but is also a red flag for potential p-hacking.\n- Changes in the analysis script, including excluding participants, could be legitimate if done based on predefined criteria or data inspection that wasn't aimed at manipulating results.\n\nHowever, the combination of these factors, especially the suspicious p-value distribution and the post-data-collection modification of the preregistration, is quite unlikely under the assumption of no misconduct, as they are indicative of practices that could be used to manipulate results.\n\nThe probability of all these events happening without misconduct is relatively low, given that some of the observed behaviors and outcomes are red flags for potential misconduct.\n\n5"
