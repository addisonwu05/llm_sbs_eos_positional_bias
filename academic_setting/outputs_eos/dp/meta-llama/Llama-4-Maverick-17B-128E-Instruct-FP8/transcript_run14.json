    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena was genuinely exploring the robustness of her findings as part of a lab-wide initiative, it is plausible that she would run and store multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria. This behavior is consistent with good research practice and a commitment to understanding the data's robustness.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable methodological decision. If the notes predating the journal submission were genuinely recorded during data collection, this action supports the argument that Lena acted in good faith, following proper research protocols.\n\n3. **Lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Technical issues such as software changes and hardware failures are not uncommon in research projects. These events can complicate data management and analysis but are beyond the researcher's control. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure lends credibility to this being an unfortunate event rather than a fabricated excuse.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A history of meticulous data handling, as evidenced by passing an independent data audit, suggests that Lena is capable of and committed to maintaining high standards in her research practices. This history supports the likelihood that her actions in the current study were also in line with good research practices.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have multiple analysis scripts due to exploring robustness.\n- She would exclude participants based on valid reasons noted before the journal submission.\n- The lab would experience technical issues like software changes and hardware failures.\n- She would have a clean record from previous audits.\n\nAll these factors align with a scenario where Lena is conducting research with integrity, facing some typical challenges that researchers encounter.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's consider the elements provided:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: A researcher committing misconduct might still run multiple scripts to create a veneer of exploring robustness or to facilitate selective reporting of results that support their hypothesis. However, the presence of such scripts doesn't necessarily indicate misconduct; it's the intent and the outcome that matter. A dishonest researcher might do this to cover their tracks or to make their actions seem more legitimate.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes**: Falsifying reasons for excluding participants could be a part of academic misconduct. However, if the notes genuinely predate the journal submission and are based on valid reasons (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions), it could be a legitimate practice. A researcher committing misconduct might fabricate such notes or reasons, but the fact that they exist and predate submission complicates the picture.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external factors that could happen regardless of Lena's integrity. A researcher committing misconduct might seize upon such events as convenient explanations for discrepancies or missing data. The IT department's confirmation of the hard drive failure supports its legitimacy.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A researcher who has committed to academic integrity in the past might still choose to misconduct in a particular instance, perhaps due to pressure or opportunity. Conversely, someone with a history of integrity might be less likely to suddenly commit misconduct, but it's not impossible.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of the described scenario occurring involves considering whether a dishonest researcher would or could still:\n- Engage in practices that look like exploring robustness ( potentially to avoid suspicion).\n- Have legitimate-sounding reasons for excluding participants (which could be fabricated).\n- Benefit from or use as an excuse external technical issues.\n- Have a prior clean record (indicating either a change in behavior or that past integrity doesn't preclude future misconduct).\n\nThe described behaviors and events could be consistent with both honest and dishonest research practices, but certain aspects, like having a prior clean record and using reasonable exclusion criteria, are less directly related to the act of misconduct itself.\n\n20"

    "content": "To evaluate this scenario, let's consider each piece of information:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's still possible to have a dataset with p-values clustering just below .05 due to chance or genuine effects. However, an unusually high concentration might suggest some form of bias or manipulation, though it could also result from legitimate analysis decisions.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to be a safeguard against post-hoc hypotheses and p-hacking. Modifying it after data collection is generally considered bad practice and can be a red flag for misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be unusual for her to alter the preregistration document in this way.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be indicative of exploring different exclusion criteria, which can be a legitimate practice if done transparently. However, if done without proper justification or disclosure, it raises questions.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a vested interest in the study's success**: Expressing pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\" is understandable given the context (grant and career implications). While this shows Lena has a motive for misconduct, it doesn't directly imply she committed it.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of all these events occurring together is low because some of them (like modifying preregistration after data collection and having an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05) are themselves indicative of questionable research practices or potential misconduct.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant results, resulting in p-values clustering just below .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Altering a preregistration document post-data collection to fit the results obtained is a form of misconduct.
