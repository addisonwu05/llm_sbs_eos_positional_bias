    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of information and how they relate to her innocence.\n\n1. **Lena's Prior Record**: Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling, with earlier projects passing an independent data audit. This suggests that she is capable of conducting research with integrity and properly documenting her data.\n\n2. **Lab's Data Management Logs and Alternative Analysis Scripts**: The fact that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students in the lab, is consistent with the lab's practices. This behavior is part of a lab-wide effort to explore the robustness of findings, which is a good research practice.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: Two participants were excluded based on notes in the raw data files that predated the journal submission. This indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known, which is a standard and acceptable practice in research to ensure data quality.\n\n4. **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab switched statistical software packages halfway through the project, and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure, leading to some file loss. Both of these are plausible events that can happen in the course of research and are not indicative of misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have a clean record prior to this study.\n- She would follow lab practices, such as running multiple analysis scripts.\n- She would exclude participants based on pre-submission notes.\n- The lab would experience a software switch and she could be affected by a hard drive failure.\n\nThese events are consistent with normal research practices and occurrences, and they do not necessarily imply misconduct. Therefore, it is reasonably likely that these circumstances would occur if Lena was innocent.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider how the described events and practices relate to her potentially fabricating or falsifying data.\n\n1. **Lena's Prior Record**: Having a clean record prior to this study doesn't directly relate to whether she committed misconduct in this specific instance, as past behavior is not a definitive indicator of future actions, though it might suggest she was more capable of hiding misconduct.\n\n2. **Lab's Data Management Logs and Alternative Analysis Scripts**: Running multiple analysis scripts could be seen as a legitimate practice, but in the context of misconduct, it could also suggest an attempt to explore different analyses to find one that yields desirable results. However, the fact that her actions are similar to those of other students suggests it might be part of the lab's culture.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: Excluding participants based on notes that predate journal submission could be a genuine practice, but if Lena committed misconduct, she might have fabricated these notes or the data to justify exclusions that helped her achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: These are events that could happen by chance and do not directly relate to her committing misconduct. However, a hard drive failure could potentially be used to explain inconsistencies or missing data.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, several of the described events could either be coincidental or part of her attempt to cover her tracks. For example, having a prior clean record doesn't necessarily affect the likelihood of current misconduct, and running multiple scripts could be either a genuine practice or part of fabricating results.\n\nHowever, the overall scenario described includes a mix of events that are plausible under both misconduct and innocence. The key is whether these events collectively make sense if she was guilty.\n\nConsidering the complexity and the mixed nature of these events, if Lena committed misconduct, she might still have followed some lab practices (like running multiple scripts) either genuinely or to appear legitimate. The hard drive failure and software switch are unrelated to her actions directly. Thus, while some aspects (like having a clean prior record) are somewhat less likely if she was generally prone to misconduct, others (like running multiple scripts) are plausible under either scenario.\n\n20"

While this could be innocent (e.g., part of exploring robustness or correcting mistakes), it also raises questions.\n\n4. **Lena's Emails**: Lena's statements about needing the study to \"work\" and the potential consequences of a null result for her career and the grant suggest she had a strong motivation to achieve significant results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The distribution of p-values being suspiciously concentrated just below .05 is unlikely without some form of bias or manipulation in the analysis.\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is not standard practice and raises red flags.\n- Having an earlier analysis script with more participants could be part of normal exploratory analysis but, combined with other factors, adds to the suspicion.\n- Lena's emails show she had a motivation to achieve certain results, but this does not directly imply misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood that all these events occurred without misconduct is low because several of the observations (especially the p-values distribution and the modification of the preregistration document post-data collection) are highly suggestive of questionable research practices or misconduct.\n\n5"
