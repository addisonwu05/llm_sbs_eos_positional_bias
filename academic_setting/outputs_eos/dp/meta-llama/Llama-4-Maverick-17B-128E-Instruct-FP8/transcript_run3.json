    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This is a common practice in research to ensure robustness and explore different analysis pathways. The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports that this behavior is in line with lab practices and not unusual or indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants based on predefined criteria (like not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. The fact that the notes are in the raw data files and predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the analysis was finalized or submitted for publication, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Both of these events are plausible and can happen due to various reasons unrelated to misconduct. The IT department confirming a hardware failure adds credibility to this being a genuine incident.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This history suggests that Lena is capable of handling data appropriately and that any current issues might not be due to intentional misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the scenario described includes several elements that are plausible and consistent with good research practices or unfortunate but explainable events. \n\nThe combination of these factors—running multiple analyses for robustness, appropriate participant exclusion based on prior notes, software change and hardware failure as plausible events, and a history of good data handling practices—suggests that if Lena did not commit misconduct, it is reasonably likely that these circumstances could occur.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information in the context of misconduct:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this could be a genuine practice, it could also be used to mask p-hacking or to make it seem like the chosen analysis was one of many considered. However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests it's a lab practice, which diminishes its direct implication in misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants appropriately to avoid raising suspicion. However, fabricating or falsifying such notes would be a more direct form of misconduct. The predating of notes suggests this was not fabricated for the publication.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such events, and they could potentially use these as explanations for discrepancies or missing data. However, these events themselves are not directly related to the likelihood of misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she had been careful or lucky enough in previous studies to avoid detection or not to engage in misconduct.\n\nThe elements described could be consistent with either misconduct or innocence, but some, like having a prior clean record and following lab practices for analysis, are less directly related to the act of committing misconduct in this specific instance. Someone committing misconduct might still have a history of clean data if they hadn't been caught before or hadn't engaged in misconduct previously.\n\nThe fact that some elements (like running multiple scripts and excluding participants based on prior notes) could be seen as following good practices or being coincidental reduces the direct implication of misconduct. However, the presence of these factors doesn't strongly indicate misconduct either.\n\nConsidering these aspects, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the described scenario is still somewhat plausible because it includes a mix of potentially innocent explanations and practices that aren't directly indicative of misconduct.\n\n20"

    "content": "Let's analyze the given information in the context of Lena not committing academic misconduct:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be suggestive of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. However, it's also possible, though less likely, that this occurred by chance or due to genuine effects being tested in a well-powered study. The absence of p-values just above .05 is notable and does raise suspicions.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to prevent exactly the kind of post-hoc adjustments that seem to have been made here. Modifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag for misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's unlikely she would modify the preregistration document in such a manner without a legitimate, transparent reason that is clearly documented.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be seen as suspicious, suggesting possible data manipulation. However, it could also be due to legitimate changes in analysis plans based on data inspection, though preregistration is supposed to lock in such decisions.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: While these emails show that Lena felt pressure and had a vested interest in the study's success, they don't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure, and wanting a study to \"work\" is common. However, it highlights a motive that could potentially lead to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the combination of these specific findings (especially the suspicious pattern of p-values, the alteration of the preregistration document post-data collection, and the exclusion of participants from an earlier analysis script) is quite unlikely because they strongly suggest behaviors that are either forms of misconduct or highly questionable research practices.\n\n5"
