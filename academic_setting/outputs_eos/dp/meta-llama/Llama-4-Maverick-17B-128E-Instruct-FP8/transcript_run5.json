    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena ran and stored multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria is consistent with the lab's practice of exploring robustness. This behavior is expected and aligns with good research practice, especially since other students in the lab showed similar patterns.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on predating notes**: The exclusion of participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes in the raw data files predating the journal submission, suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the submission. This is a reasonable and transparent research practice.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software and the loss of files due to a hard drive failure are plausible occurrences in a research setting. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Lena's history of careful data handling and the fact that her earlier projects passed an independent data audit suggest that she is capable of maintaining high standards in her research.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is plausible that:\n- She would follow lab practices and run multiple analysis scripts.\n- She would document and exclude participants based on valid reasons before submission.\n- The lab would experience a software change and technical issues like a hard drive failure.\n- She would have a clean record from previous audits, indicating a history of good practice.\n\nAll these elements are consistent with normal, honest research practices and occurrences. Therefore, if Lena is innocent, it is quite likely that these events and findings would occur as described.\n\n80"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's consider the elements presented:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple scripts to cover her tracks or to make her results appear more robust. However, the fact that her behavior is similar to other students suggests this could be part of normal lab practice rather than an attempt to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Excluding participants with predating notes**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might fabricate notes or rationalize excluding participants to fit her hypothesis. However, the notes predating the journal submission could indicate genuine reasons for exclusion.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events that could happen regardless of Lena's actions. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such events.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: A person committing misconduct in one instance might still have a history of clean data if this was their first instance of misconduct or if they were previously careful.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the described events could still occur. She might follow lab practices (like running multiple scripts) to appear diligent. The exclusion of participants and documentation could be fabricated or real. External events like software changes and hardware failures are independent of her actions. A history of clean data doesn't preclude a first instance of misconduct.\n\nHowever, the combination of these factors doesn't directly suggest or strongly support the hypothesis of misconduct. A person committing misconduct might try to cover their tracks in various ways, but the described scenario doesn't necessarily indicate an attempt to do so in a way that's inconsistent with innocent explanations.\n\nThe likelihood of these events occurring if Lena committed misconduct is not extremely low because many of these factors are either unrelated to her actions (like the lab's software switch and hardware failure) or could be part of either honest or dishonest research practices.\n\n40"

If Lena didn't commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern naturally.\n\n2. **Modification of preregistration after data collection**: Changing the preregistration document after data collection is unusual and could indicate an attempt to align the preregistered plan with the actual analysis performed, potentially suggesting misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants**: Having an earlier script that includes participants not in the final dataset could indicate changes in analysis plans or data handling practices. While not necessarily indicative of misconduct, it could be if the changes were made to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and desire for the study to \"work\"**: Lena's emails show she felt pressure and had a vested interest in the study's success, which could motivate misconduct. However, feeling pressure doesn't necessarily lead to misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of observing all these factors together is low because some of them (like the suspicious p-value distribution and the modification of preregistration after data collection) are indicative of potential misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices.\n\nThe presence of several red flags together (suspicious p-values, post-hoc changes to preregistration, and emails indicating a strong desire for a positive outcome) makes it less likely that Lena is innocent.\n\n5"
