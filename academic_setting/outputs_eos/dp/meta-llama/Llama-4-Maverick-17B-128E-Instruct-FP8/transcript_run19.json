    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

It's a strong alibi, suggesting that if the failure happened immediately after Alex left, it's less likely Alex caused it directly, especially if we assume the failure wasn't something that could be triggered remotely or was a result of an action that had a delayed effect.\n\n2. **Security camera footage showing Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper**: This suggests that Jamie might have handled the printer roughly, which could be a contributing factor to its failure. It introduces reasonable doubt about Alex being the sole or primary cause of the printer's breakdown.\n\n3. **The printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments**: This information is crucial as it indicates that the failure could be due to a mechanical defect or a known issue with the printer model rather than user error. It supports the possibility that the breakdown was not caused by Alex or any other individual's misuse but rather by an inherent flaw in the printer.\n\n4. **Alex had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems**: This history suggests that Alex is proactive about reporting issues and is not someone who would neglect or maliciously damage equipment without reporting it. It enhances Alex's credibility and suggests that if Alex had caused the damage, they would likely have reported it or been more forthcoming about their actions around the time of the failure.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Alex was not present when the printer failed.\n- There's evidence of another person (Jamie) handling the printer roughly.\n- The printer has a history of failing due to a known mechanical issue.\n- Alex has a history of reporting problems with office equipment.\n\nAll these factors collectively support the notion that Alex did not break the printer. They provide alternative explanations for the printer's failure (mechanical defect, Jamie's actions) and support Alex's credibility (previous reporting behavior, not being present at the time of failure).\n\n80"

It supports the idea that if Alex had broken the printer, they might have reported it or been more open about their actions.\n\nHowever, the question is about the likelihood that Alex broke the printer given the evidence. While the fact that Alex badged out and was not present is a strong alibi, the other evidence (Jamie's actions, the printer's history, Alex's reporting behavior) doesn't directly prove Alex's innocence or guilt but rather provides context.\n\nThe evidence that Alex was not in the building and had a history of reporting issues somewhat reduces the likelihood that Alex broke the printer. However, it doesn't eliminate the possibility entirely, as Alex could have potentially caused the issue before leaving.\n\n20"
