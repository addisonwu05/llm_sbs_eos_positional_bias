    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena ran and stored multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide initiative suggests a legitimate practice aimed at exploring the robustness of the findings. This behavior is consistent with good research practice and is not indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants**: The exclusion of participants based on notes in the raw data files that predate journal submission is a standard practice in research. It indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the submission, reducing the likelihood that this was a post-hoc decision to manipulate the results.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software and the loss of files due to a hard drive failure are unfortunate events that can happen in any research setting. These are plausible explanations for some irregularities or missing data and do not directly imply misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data handling**: Lena's history of well-documented and reproducible data handling in previous studies, which passed an independent audit, supports the notion that she is capable of managing data properly and suggests that her actions in the current study might not be indicative of intentional misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have run multiple analysis scripts as part of exploring robustness, consistent with lab practices.\n- The exclusion of two participants would be based on pre-existing notes, indicating a legitimate reason for their exclusion.\n- The lab would have faced technical issues such as a software switch and a hard drive failure, which are not uncommon in research environments.\n- She would have a clean record from previous studies, indicating a history of good research practice.\n\nGiven these considerations, the scenario described is fairly likely if Lena did not commit misconduct because it aligns with normal research practices and challenges, and there are innocent explanations for the observed facts.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information:\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she might still have run multiple scripts to create the appearance of exploring robustness, making her actions seem more legitimate. However, this could also be a genuine practice. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests it's a lab practice, not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on pre-existing notes**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants based on legitimate reasons to avoid raising suspicions. The notes predating the journal submission could be fabricated or could be genuine. This does not directly indicate misconduct but doesn't rule it out either.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and hard drive failure**: These are events that can happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct could still experience these issues. The hard drive failure could potentially be used as an excuse for missing or altered files, but in this case, it's confirmed, so it doesn't directly relate to the misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data handling**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she had been careful in previous studies to avoid detection or because she hadn't felt the need to misconduct until now. A prior clean record doesn't necessarily preclude misconduct in a specific instance.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the described scenario is still relatively plausible because many of the factors (running multiple scripts, legitimate exclusions, technical issues, prior clean record) are not directly indicative of misconduct and can occur independently. However, one might expect that someone committing misconduct could be less likely to leave a trail that looks so normal or to have such a clean prior record.\n\n60"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information:\n\n1. **Concentration of p-values just below .05**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above it is suspicious and can indicate p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc adjustments to the analysis plan based on the data. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag for misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it is unlikely she would alter the preregistration after seeing the data.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: While having an earlier analysis script with more participants than the final dataset could be legitimate (e.g., excluding participants based on pre-defined criteria), it could also suggest that the final dataset was curated in a way that might not be transparent or justifiable. However, this alone isn't conclusive evidence of misconduct without more context.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: Lena's emails to a friend show she felt pressure due to her supervisor's expectations and her own career prospects. While this shows she had a motive to achieve certain results, it doesn't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure, and it's not uncommon for them to express such feelings.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document are particularly suspicious and less likely under the assumption of no misconduct.\n- The existence of an earlier analysis script with more participants could be legitimate but adds to the overall suspicious context.\n- Her emails reflect pressure and a personal stake, which is plausible without misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors, especially the suspicious pattern of p-values and the post-data collection modification of the preregistration, makes the scenario less likely if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\n5"

The existence of an earlier script with more participants, who were later excluded, could be part of this process.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and personal stake**: Lena's emails showing she felt pressure and had a personal stake in the study's success are consistent with a motive for misconduct. While not direct evidence, they provide context for why she might engage in such behavior.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct:\n- The suspicious pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document are consistent with misconduct.\n- Excluding participants in the final dataset, as indicated by the earlier analysis script, could be part of manipulating the data.\n- Her expressed pressure and personal stake provide a plausible motive.\n\nTherefore, the described scenario is quite plausible if Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n80"
