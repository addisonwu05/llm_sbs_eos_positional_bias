    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to evaluate the probability of each piece of information occurring independently and then consider how they collectively relate to the scenario where Lena is innocent.\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: This is a common practice in research to test the robustness of findings. The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports that this is a lab-wide practice or culture, making it more plausible.\n\n2. **Two participants were excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes predating the journal submission**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons such as not understanding the instructions or falling asleep during the task is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome was known, supporting the integrity of the process.\n\n3. **The lab switched software mid-project and Lena’s laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss**: Technical issues and changes in software are not uncommon in research projects. The confirmation of a hard drive failure by the IT department lends credibility to this explanation for missing files.\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit**: A history of meticulous data handling supports the argument that Lena is capable of conducting research with integrity.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events are plausible and even expected in the context of research practices and the challenges that researchers sometimes face (like hardware failures). The fact that Lena has a history of good research practices and that the lab was exploring robustness by running multiple analyses supports her innocence. The occurrence of a hard drive failure and the practice of excluding participants based on pre-submission notes also align with innocent explanations.\n\nTherefore, given that all these factors are individually plausible and collectively consistent with a narrative of innocent or unintentional actions rather than misconduct, the probability that these events would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is relatively high.\n\n80"

However, a researcher committing misconduct might also be expected to hide or not document such explorations if they reveal unfavorable results. The fact that her actions are similar to other students could be seen as an attempt to appear normal.\n\n2. **Two participants were excluded with valid reasons and notes predating journal submission**: This action is consistent with good research practice and doesn't directly indicate misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants for valid reasons to maintain a veneer of integrity.\n\n3. **The lab switched software and Lena’s laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: These are events beyond Lena's control and could happen regardless of her integrity. A researcher committing misconduct might potentially try to exploit such events to explain away inconsistencies or missing data, but the occurrence of these events themselves isn't directly related to her actions.\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A history of good practice doesn't necessarily preclude someone from later committing misconduct, as individuals can change their behavior. However, it's also possible that someone who has committed misconduct in the past might be more likely to be caught or to have a history that raises suspicions. In Lena's case, her previous clean record could suggest that she either wasn't previously tempted or wasn't previously in a situation where she felt misconduct was necessary or justifiable.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it's plausible that she would still engage in practices that appear proper (like running multiple analyses and excluding participants based on valid criteria) to avoid detection. The events described don't directly indicate misconduct and could be part of a strategy to appear legitimate. However, the fact that she has a clean history and that some explanations (like the hard drive failure) are beyond her control adds complexity.\n\nConsidering these points, the likelihood of these events occurring if Lena did commit misconduct is not extremely low because many of these factors could be part of an attempt to appear legitimate or could be coincidental.\n\n20"

A concentration just below .05 could suggest selective reporting or p-hacking, which is a form of academic misconduct.\n\n2. **The preregistration document was modified after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency by specifying analysis plans before data is collected. Modifying it after data collection without a clear, valid reason could indicate an attempt to make the analysis fit the data, which is not in line with good research practice.\n\n3. **An earlier analysis script included additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that participants were excluded post-hoc, potentially to achieve desired results. While excluding participants is a normal part of data cleaning, doing so in a way that significantly alters the outcome could be suspicious.\n\n4. **Lena's emails expressed pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: These statements indicate that Lena felt pressure to achieve certain results, which could potentially lead to misconduct if not managed properly.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be expected that her practices (like modifying preregistration or excluding participants) were done for legitimate reasons and not to manipulate the results. However, the unusual distribution of p-values is a strong indicator against innocence because it suggests manipulation or selective reporting.\n\nWhile it's possible for innocent explanations to exist for each individual issue, the combination of factors (pressure to publish, unusual p-value distribution, post-hoc changes to analysis plans) collectively raises significant suspicions.\n\nThe probability of these events occurring together if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is low due to the unusual distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, both of which are red flags for potential misconduct.\n\n5"
