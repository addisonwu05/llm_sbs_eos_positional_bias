    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of information provided and their implications.\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This is a common practice in research to test the robustness of findings. The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests this was part of the lab's culture or a recommended practice, possibly as part of the \"lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" This behavior is consistent with good research practice and not indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Two participants were excluded based on notes in the raw data files**: Excluding participants who did not understand the task or fell asleep is a standard procedure to ensure data quality. The fact that the notes predating the journal submission supports the notion that these exclusions were decided before the analysis was finalized or submitted for publication, suggesting that the decision to exclude these participants was not made post-hoc to manipulate the results.\n\n3. **The lab switched statistical software packages and Lena’s laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: Both of these events are plausible and can happen in the course of research. The software switch could be due to various reasons such as a change in lab policy, availability of new features, or compatibility issues. A hard drive failure is a common risk, and the IT department's confirmation supports that this was a genuine hardware issue rather than a fabricated excuse.\n\n4. **Lena’s prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This suggests that Lena has a history of conducting research with integrity. Her earlier projects passed an independent data audit, indicating that her previous work was done to a high standard of data management and integrity.\n\nConsidering these points together, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her to be following good research practices (as evidenced by running multiple analyses and having a clean prior record), and we would expect some level of randomness and genuine issues (like software changes and hardware failures) to occur as they do in many research projects.\n\nThe combination of these factors—good research practices, genuine issues like a hard drive failure, and a clean prior record—being observed together is more likely if Lena is conducting her research with integrity.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of information and how they relate to potential misconduct.\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this can be a sign of good practice, it could also be used to suggest that she was exploring different analyses to find one that yielded desired results. However, the fact that other students did the same thing as part of a lab-wide effort makes it less suspicious.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants with notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might have fabricated these notes or the data to justify exclusions that were actually decided upon post-hoc. However, the presence of genuine reasons (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) and notes predating the submission reduces the likelihood that this specific aspect was directly fabricated.\n\n3. **Lab switched software and Lena’s laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still experience a hard drive failure or be in a lab that switches software. These are not directly related to the integrity of Lena's actions.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible that she had been careful or lucky enough in her previous studies to avoid detection or had not felt the need to misconduct her research previously.\n\nThe combination of these factors doesn't directly support or refute misconduct outright. However, someone committing misconduct might still:\n\n- Follow some good practices (like running multiple analyses) either genuinely or as a cover.\n- Have legitimate reasons for excluding participants, even if some decisions were made with an intent to support their hypothesis.\n- Experience unrelated technical issues like software changes or hardware failures.\n- Have a clean prior record if they had not previously felt the need to, or had not been caught, misconducting research.\n\nConsidering the mixture of behaviors and events that are both consistent with good practice and not directly indicative of misconduct, the probability that these specific circumstances would occur even if Lena committed misconduct is relatively high because many of these factors are not directly related to the act of misconduct itself.\n\n60"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be suspicious and is often associated with p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to increase transparency by specifying the study's methodology and analysis plan before data collection. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a red flag for misconduct. If Lena was acting with integrity, she would be expected to adhere to the original preregistration or clearly document any necessary changes with justification, not alter it post-hoc without clear reason.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in analysis plans or data cleaning. However, if the changes were made without a transparent or valid reason and resulted in a more favorable outcome, it could be seen as suspicious.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: While having pressure and a desire for a certain outcome is common in research, it can also be a motivator for misconduct. However, many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is less likely that we would see a suspicious pattern of p-values, post-hoc changes to the preregistration document, and other indicators that suggest manipulation or selective reporting. The presence of these factors together is more indicative of misconduct.\n\nHowever, it's not impossible for these events to co-occur without misconduct (e.g., through a combination of legitimate analysis decisions and chance), but it becomes increasingly improbable as the patterns observed become more suggestive of manipulation.\n\n5"
