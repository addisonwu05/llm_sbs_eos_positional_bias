    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario under the condition that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the probability of each piece of evidence occurring given her innocence and then assess how these probabilities collectively inform our judgment.\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This is a practice that is encouraged in many research environments as it pertains to exploring the robustness of findings. If Lena was following a lab-wide push to explore robustness, this behavior is expected and aligns with good research practice. Thus, it's quite plausible (likely) under the assumption of innocence.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons such as not understanding instructions or falling asleep during the task is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predating the journal submission support this exclusion suggests that the decision was made before the outcome was known, which is in line with proper research conduct. This scenario is plausible under the assumption of innocence.\n\n3. **Lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but possible events in a research setting. Labs often upgrade or change their tools, including statistical software, as part of their development or to adopt new methodologies. Hardware failures are also not uncommon due to the heavy use of equipment like laptops. Thus, these events, while potentially problematic, are within the realm of normal operational risks and not indicative of misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Having a history of conducting research with high integrity (as evidenced by passing an independent data audit) is consistent with the behavior of a researcher who does not commit misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events are not only plausible but also consistent with good research practices and the vicissitudes of conducting research. The presence of alternative analysis scripts and the exclusion of participants based on prior notes indicate adherence to good research practices. The lab's change in software and the hard drive failure are unfortunate events that can happen in any research setting. Her prior clean record further supports the likelihood of these events occurring without misconduct.\n\nTherefore, given that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that the described scenario would occur.\n\n80"

However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this might be a lab practice rather than an indicator of misconduct specific to Lena.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants with notes predating journal submission**: This is consistent with proper research practice and doesn't directly indicate misconduct. However, a researcher committing misconduct might still follow proper exclusion practices to avoid raising suspicions.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still experience such technical issues.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: A person committing misconduct in one study might still have a history of clean data if they were previously conducting research with integrity or if they were not previously caught.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it's plausible that she would still:\n- Follow lab practices or create the appearance of doing so by running multiple scripts.\n- Exclude participants based on valid reasons that were documented before the journal submission to maintain a veneer of legitimacy.\n- Experience technical issues like software changes or hardware failures, as these are unrelated to the integrity of her actions.\n- Have a prior clean record if the misconduct is a recent development or if she was careful enough not to get caught previously.\n\nHowever, the scenario described doesn't strongly support or refute misconduct directly through these actions alone, as they can be explained by both innocent and guilty scenarios. The presence of these factors doesn't necessarily decrease the likelihood of misconduct, as a sophisticated or cautious individual committing misconduct might still maintain some appearances of good practice.\n\nGiven that these factors can be seen in both scenarios (misconduct or not), they don't strongly indicate one way or the other. However, considering the context that an individual committing misconduct might still follow some good practices or take steps to appear legitimate, the likelihood is not extremely low.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the described scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely (though not impossible due to chance or genuine effects) that she would end up with such a distribution of p-values.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent changing the analysis plan after seeing the data. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a red flag for misconduct. If Lena was innocent, it's unlikely she would modify the preregistration document in such a manner.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that participants were excluded post-hoc, potentially to improve the results. If Lena didn't commit misconduct, it's possible that the exclusion was based on valid reasons decided before analyzing the data, but the fact that an earlier version included more participants raises suspicions.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: While these emails show that Lena felt pressure and had a vested interest in a successful outcome, they don't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure, and it's plausible for an innocent researcher to express such sentiments.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document are less likely under innocence because they suggest actions that are typically considered misconduct.\n- Having an earlier analysis script with more participants could happen for various reasons, not all of which imply misconduct, but it does raise questions.\n- Expressing pressure and a desire for success is plausible for an innocent researcher under pressure.\n\nThe combination of these factors, especially the first two, makes the scenario less likely under the assumption of innocence because they strongly suggest behaviors that are typically associated with misconduct.\n\n5"
