    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information provided step by step.\n\n1. **Lena's prior record and data management practices**: The fact that Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit suggests that she is capable of managing data properly. This history supports the notion that she might not have committed misconduct in the current study.\n\n2. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The lab-wide push to explore robustness by running analyses with different exclusion criteria explains why Lena, like other students, would have multiple scripts. This practice is a reasonable and transparent approach to data analysis, indicating a genuine effort to test the robustness of findings rather than fabricating data.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: The exclusion of two participants due to issues reported during the study (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes that predate the journal submission suggests that these decisions were made before the results were known or submitted for publication. This transparency in data handling supports Lena's claim of not having manipulated the data post-hoc.\n\n4. **Lab's switch of statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: The change in software and the hard drive failure are events beyond Lena's control that could explain some irregularities or missing files. The confirmation of a hardware failure by the IT department lends credibility to Lena's explanation for any file loss or discrepancies.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events and findings could plausibly occur due to a combination of standard research practices (running multiple analyses for robustness), unfortunate but explainable events (hard drive failure), and a pre-existing good record of data handling. All these factors are consistent with a scenario where Lena acted with integrity.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information provided.\n\n1. **Lena's actions being consistent with good practice despite misconduct**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it's somewhat surprising that she maintained some good practices (like documenting alternative analyses and having notes on participant exclusion that predated the journal submission). However, a researcher committing misconduct might still follow some good practices to make their actions less suspicious.\n\n2. **Running multiple analysis scripts and excluding participants based on prior notes**: A person committing misconduct might still run multiple analyses to make their data handling seem transparent and robust. Excluding participants based on prior notes could be part of fabricating a narrative of proper data handling.\n\n3. **Lab events like software switch and hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of Lena's integrity. They provide a plausible explanation for discrepancies or missing files, which could be used to cover or be unrelated to any potential misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data handling**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, her prior clean record could indicate either that this was an isolated incident or that she was more careful in the past.\n\nConsidering these points, the described scenario includes elements that could be part of a strategy to appear diligent and transparent, potentially masking misconduct. However, some elements, like the lab's software switch and the hard drive failure, are unrelated to Lena's actions. The prior clean record could be seen as either genuinely reflective of her past behavior or an attempt to establish a veneer of credibility.\n\nThe probability that these events occur if Lena committed misconduct is lower than if she didn't because some of these actions and events (like having a prior clean record and excluding participants based on pre-existing criteria) are less likely to be associated directly with someone who is fabricating data, as they suggest a level of transparency and adherence to good practice.\n\n20"

    "content": "Let's analyze the given information step by step to assess the likelihood of the scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n1. **Concentration of p-values just below .05**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (with few just above) can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this pattern is less likely because it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency by specifying the study's methodology and analysis plan before data collection. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a red flag for potential misconduct. If Lena acted with integrity, it's unlikely she would alter the preregistration document in such a manner post-data collection.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: Having an earlier version of the analysis script that includes more participants than the final dataset could indicate that decisions on participant exclusion were made post-hoc. While this could be a legitimate part of data cleaning, the context (including other suspicious factors) is crucial. It could be seen as suspicious if it appears that exclusions were decided based on achieving desired outcomes.\n\n4. **Lena's emails expressing pressure and desire for the study to succeed**: Lena's emails indicate she felt pressure to succeed due to its impact on her career and her supervisor's grant. While these statements show motivation and perhaps a personal stake, they don't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure to publish significant results, but this pressure doesn't necessarily lead to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the combination of these factors (especially the suspicious pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document post-data collection) is quite unlikely because they strongly suggest behaviors associated with misconduct.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate analyses to achieve significant results, resulting in this pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a red flag for misconduct. If Lena committed academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document to align with analyses that yielded desired results is a likely action.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script with additional participants later excluded**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might exclude participants in the final analysis to achieve the desired outcome, which could explain why earlier scripts included more participants.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: These emails show Lena's motivation to succeed, potentially to avoid negative consequences for her career and her supervisor's grant.
