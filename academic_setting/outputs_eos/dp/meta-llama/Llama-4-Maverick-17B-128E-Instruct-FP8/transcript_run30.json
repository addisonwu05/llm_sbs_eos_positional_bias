    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.

This timing doesn't directly implicate Alex since he was not present when the failure occurred.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**: The footage shows Jamie pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, which could potentially damage the printer. This indicates another person interacted with the printer in a way that might have caused or contributed to its failure.\n\n3. **Printer Model's History**: The printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit and has failed similarly in other departments without evidence of improper handling. This suggests that the failure could be due to a mechanical defect rather than user error or intentional damage.\n\n4. **Alex's Previous Behavior and Reporting**: Alex had previously reported issues with the printer (a grinding noise) and has a history of promptly reporting equipment problems. This behavior is consistent with someone who is cautious and not likely to be reckless with office equipment.\n\nGiven these points, the fact that Alex badged out before the failure, the evidence of Jamie's interaction with the printer, the known mechanical issues with the printer model, and Alex's history of responsible behavior regarding office equipment all support the notion that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n80"

This gap makes it less likely that Alex's immediate actions caused the failure, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that something Alex did just before leaving caused the failure.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**: Jamie's forceful interaction with the printer is noted, but it happened earlier in the afternoon. While this suggests Jamie could have potentially damaged the printer, it doesn't directly implicate or exonerate Alex.\n\n3. **Printer Model's History**: The printer model's known issues with the fuser unit provide an alternative explanation for the failure, making it less likely that Alex (or anyone else) was responsible.\n\n4. **Alex's Previous Behavior and Reporting**: Alex's history of reporting equipment issues promptly, including the grinding noise from the printer before it failed, suggests that Alex was concerned about the printer's condition and is not typically reckless with office equipment. However, this doesn't directly prove or disprove Alex's involvement in the breakdown.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the evidence doesn't strongly support the idea that Alex broke the printer (due to the timing of his departure, the printer model's known issues, and Jamie's interaction with the printer), it's still possible that Alex's actions contributed to the failure.\n\n20"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This change in statement could indicate deception or simply a lapse in memory. It's not conclusive evidence of breaking the printer.\n\n2. **Presence Near the Printer**: A coworker saw Alex near the printer about 5 minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching. This places Alex at the scene around the time of the failure but doesn't directly prove they caused it.\n\n3. **Complaint About the Printer**: Alex expressed frustration with the printer in the team chat. While this indicates Alex was irritated, it doesn't necessarily imply they would damage the printer.\n\n4. **Plastic Fragments**: Finding fragments similar to the printer's broken tray in Alex's trash can is suspicious, as it suggests a possible link between Alex's actions and the printer's damage. However, it doesn't directly prove Alex broke the printer.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence against Alex is circumstantial and could be interpreted in different ways. The fact that Alex was seen near the printer shortly before it failed and the presence of plastic fragments in their trash are incriminating. However, the alternative explanations, such as the printer's known mechanical issues and the presence of other individuals interacting with the printer (like Jamie), still exist.\n\nThe combination of these factors makes it less likely that Alex did not break the printer, given the new information. However, the probability still depends on how one weighs the circumstantial evidence against the alternative explanations.\n\n20"
