    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's consider the elements presented:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is consistent with good research practice, especially in the context of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. It suggests a genuine effort to test the robustness of findings rather than cherry-picking results.\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable methodological decision, and doing so based on notes that predate the journal submission indicates that the decision was made before the outcome was known, reducing the likelihood of it being a manipulative tactic.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events beyond Lena's control that could explain irregularities or missing files without implying misconduct. The confirmation of a hardware failure by the IT department adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A history of meticulous data handling and passing an independent audit suggests that Lena is capable of and has previously conducted research with integrity.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is plausible that:\n- She would engage in practices like running multiple analyses as part of a genuine research effort.\n- She would exclude participants based on legitimate reasons documented before the study's outcome was known.\n- External factors like software changes and hardware failures could happen and affect her data management.\n- Her past behavior indicates a pattern of good research practice.\n\nTherefore, the scenario described is quite likely if Lena did not commit misconduct, as it aligns with good research practices and is affected by external factors that are beyond her control.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the elements presented in the context of misconduct:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this could be a genuine practice, it could also be used to mask p-hacking or data manipulation. However, the fact that it's similar to other students' practices suggests it might be a lab-wide behavior rather than something unique to Lena's potential misconduct.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes**: This is a reasonable practice and doesn't directly indicate misconduct. The notes predating the journal submission suggest that the exclusion wasn't done to manipulate the results post-hoc.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external factors that could complicate data handling and analysis but don't directly relate to whether Lena committed misconduct. They could potentially be used as explanations for irregularities.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's somewhat surprising that she has a previously clean record. This could suggest that the misconduct was either a one-time lapse or that she was previously more cautious.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the described scenario includes both behaviors that could be seen as innocent or good practice (running multiple analyses, excluding participants based on prior notes, having a clean record) and external factors that could affect data handling (software switch, hard drive failure). The presence of multiple analysis scripts and a clean prior record might be seen as less likely if she were trying to cover her tracks or hadn't previously engaged in such practices as part of genuine research. However, the fact that her actions (like running multiple scripts) are similar to others in the lab and that there are reasonable explanations for some of the observations (participant exclusion, external factors affecting data) means the scenario isn't extremely unlikely.\n\nThe scenario is not highly improbable because many of the factors (like the lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses, external issues with software and hardware) aren't directly indicative of misconduct or innocence but rather contextual factors. However, the combination of a previously clean record with potential misconduct in one instance is somewhat counterintuitive but not impossible.\n\n40"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the elements presented:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which is a form of academic misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a process meant to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc changes that could bias results. Changing the preregistered plan after data collection suggests a deviation from this principle and could indicate an attempt to make the results appear more significant than they are.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could indicate that participants were excluded post-hoc to influence the results, which is a form of data manipulation.\n\n4. **Emails expressing pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: While these statements show that Lena felt pressure and had a vested interest in the study's success, they don't directly imply misconduct. However, they do provide context that could motivate someone to engage in questionable practices.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's less likely that:\n- The p-values would cluster just below .05 without any just above, as this is an unusual pattern that can be associated with manipulation.\n- The preregistration document would be altered after data collection, as this goes against the principle of preregistration.\n- Participants would be excluded in a way that isn't transparent or justified by the initial protocol.\n\nThe presence of these factors, especially the suspicious pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, is less likely if Lena acted with integrity.\n\nThe pressure Lena felt, as expressed in her emails, could be seen as a context that might lead to misconduct, but it doesn't directly prove it.\n\nGiven these considerations, the scenario described is somewhat unlikely if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, primarily due to the suspicious patterns and changes that could indicate data manipulation or p-hacking.\n\n10"
