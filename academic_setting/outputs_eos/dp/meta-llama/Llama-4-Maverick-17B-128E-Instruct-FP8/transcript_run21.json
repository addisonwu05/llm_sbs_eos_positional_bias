    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

It's plausible and not indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Two participants being excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission**: Excluding participants based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is standard practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude them was made before the outcome was known, supporting the integrity of the process.\n\n3. **The lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Lab environments often evolve, including changes in software. Hardware failures are also not uncommon.\n\n4. **Lena having a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit**: This indicates a history of good research practice, making it more likely that her behavior in the current study was consistent with her past behavior, assuming no misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events are quite plausible:\n- Running multiple analyses is good practice and aligns with lab policies.\n- Excluding participants based on pre-specified criteria is standard.\n- Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are common.\n- A history of clean data handling supports the likelihood of continued good practice.\n\nThus, given that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would observe these events as they are either indicative of good research practice or are unrelated to misconduct.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider how each piece of evidence relates to the possibility of misconduct.\n\n1. **The lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple analyses to cover her tracks or to appear as though she was exploring different options. However, the fact that her behavior is similar to other students suggests this might be part of normal lab practice rather than an attempt to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Two participants being excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission**: This is indicative of good practice and suggests that the exclusion was not done post-hoc to manipulate results. If Lena committed misconduct, it's still possible she followed proper exclusion criteria, but it's also possible she fabricated the notes or the exclusions. However, the fact that the notes predate the submission somewhat supports the integrity of the exclusion process.\n\n3. **The lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such technical issues, and they could potentially be used as an excuse for inconsistencies or missing data.\n\n4. **Lena having a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, this history suggests she might have previously been honest or had not been caught. It doesn't directly relate to whether she committed misconduct this time.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the described events could still occur. The actions that are indicative of good practice (running multiple analyses, proper exclusion of participants) could be part of a facade. The technical issues (software change, hard drive failure) are unrelated to her behavior. Her prior clean record could indicate that this was a one-time lapse or that she had previously been careful.\n\nHowever, it's somewhat less likely that she would have a prior clean record if she was willing to commit misconduct, as it might suggest a pattern of behavior. On the other hand, the events described do not strongly suggest guilt; they are either neutral or indicative of good practice.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's examine each piece of evidence.\n\n1. **The final dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting, both of which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to see such a pattern, as it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve significant results.\n\n2. **The preregistration document being modified after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc changes that could be considered misconduct. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is highly suspicious and suggests potential misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's unlikely she would modify the preregistration document after collecting data.\n\n3. **An earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that participants were excluded post-hoc, which could be considered misconduct if not properly justified. However, it's also possible that there were valid reasons for the exclusion that were not related to the outcome.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure to produce a certain result**: While these emails suggest that Lena felt pressure, which could potentially lead to misconduct, they do not directly imply that she committed misconduct. Many researchers feel pressure to publish or secure grants without resorting to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, the combination of a suspicious pattern of p-values, modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the exclusion of participants from an earlier analysis script are all indicative of potential misconduct. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is unlikely that we would observe these specific patterns, especially the first two.\n\nThe pressure Lena felt, as expressed in her emails, is plausible without misconduct, but the other factors are less likely to occur innocently.\n\n5"
