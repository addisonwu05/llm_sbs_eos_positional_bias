    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of information provided and assess how plausible they are under the assumption of her innocence.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This is a common practice in research to check the robustness of findings. The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests it was part of the lab culture or a recommended practice, making it plausible that Lena did this without any intent to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: The exclusion of participants based on valid reasons (e.g., falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with documentation that predates the journal submission supports the notion that these decisions were made before the results were known, reducing the likelihood of these being post-hoc manipulations to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events in a research setting. Labs often adopt new tools or software as part of keeping up with best practices or due to institutional recommendations. Hardware failures are also common and can happen to anyone.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Lena having a previously clean record with her data handling and having passed an independent data audit suggests that she is capable of maintaining high standards in her research. This history supports the idea that she might not have intentionally compromised the data in the study under investigation.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She ran multiple analyses as part of exploring robustness, consistent with lab practices.\n- The exclusion of certain participants was based on genuine reasons documented before the journal submission.\n- The lab experienced a software change and a hardware failure, which are unfortunate but possible events.\n- Her previous work was well-documented and passed an audit, indicating a history of good practice.\n\nAll these factors together paint a scenario that is not only possible but relatively likely under the assumption that Lena did not commit misconduct. The events described are a mix of good research practices, unfortunate accidents, and a previously demonstrated ability to handle data properly.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider how plausible it is that she would still exhibit behaviors or have circumstances that appear benign or even positive, alongside potentially suspicious or compromised data.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple analyses, but the intent could be different. However, the fact that her actions are similar to other students suggests a possible genuine exploration of robustness. It's somewhat plausible a researcher committing misconduct could still follow this practice, either to cover their tracks or as part of their manipulative strategy.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants with notes predating journal submission**: A researcher committing misconduct might fabricate or alter records to make their decisions seem pre-decided. However, the fact that the notes predate the journal submission could suggest either genuine documentation or a careful attempt to cover tracks.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that can happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might not be able to prevent or might not be directly related to these events.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A person committing misconduct in one instance might have a history of good practice, as misconduct can be a one-time lapse or a decision made under specific pressures.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the described scenario is still possible. The actions and events (running multiple scripts, excluding participants with prior notes, software switch, hardware failure, and previous clean record) don't directly imply guilt or innocence but could be consistent with either, depending on interpretation.\n\nThe key here is that some of these factors (like having a clean prior record and lab-wide practices) are somewhat independent of the misconduct in the specific study in question, and others (like the software switch and hardware failure) are events that could happen to anyone. Thus, it's not extremely unlikely that these conditions could be met even if Lena committed misconduct.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is suspicious and can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that are considered academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation of data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Preregistration document modified after data collection**: Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a red flag. Preregistration is meant to be a transparent record of planned analyses before seeing the data. Changing it post-hoc without clear justification can indicate an attempt to make the analysis fit the data in a way that wasn't predetermined, which is against the principles of preregistration.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that decisions about which participants to include or exclude were made or altered after initial analyses, which could be part of a process to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to produce a certain outcome**: Lena's emails express a clear motivation to succeed with this study due to its potential impact on her career and her supervisor's grant. While having a motivation to succeed doesn't necessarily imply misconduct, it can be a contextual factor that might influence behavior.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be unlikely to see a combination of suspicious patterns like a high concentration of p-values just below .05, modification of preregistration documents post-data collection, and changes in participant inclusion/exclusion that could indicate post-hoc decision-making. These factors together paint a picture that is more aligned with misconduct than with innocent practices.\n\nGiven these observations, the scenario described is not very likely if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant results, resulting in this pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration to fit the obtained data is a sign of potential misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration document post-data collection would be a plausible action to cover her tracks or justify her analyses.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants later excluded**: This could be a sign of selective exclusion or inclusion of data points to achieve desired results, a practice that could be part of misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a need for the study to succeed**: These emails show Lena was under pressure and had a strong motivation to achieve certain results. While not misconduct in themselves, they provide a context where misconduct might be more likely.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it's quite plausible that:\n- She would manipulate or selectively report analyses to achieve statistically significant results, leading to an unusual distribution of p-values.\n- She might modify the preregistration document to align with her actual analyses or to justify changes made post-hoc.\n- She could exclude participants in a way that achieves the desired outcome, and evidence of this could be found in earlier analysis scripts.\n\nThese actions and patterns are consistent with what might be expected if Lena engaged in misconduct, such as p-hacking, selective reporting, or altering documentation to fit her results.\n\n85"
