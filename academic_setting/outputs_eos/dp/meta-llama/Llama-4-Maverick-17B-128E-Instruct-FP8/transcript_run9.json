    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information provided step by step:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena ran and stored multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide initiative to explore robustness is consistent with good research practice. It indicates a thorough approach to data analysis, exploring how different criteria might affect the results. This behavior is expected and appropriate, especially in a research environment that encourages robustness checks.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable methodological decision, as it ensures the data analyzed is relevant and reliable. The fact that the notes justifying these exclusions predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known, reducing the likelihood of this being a post-hoc manipulation to achieve desired results.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software mid-project and the loss of some files due to a hard drive failure are unfortunate events that can happen in the course of research. These are plausible and mundane explanations for any irregularities or missing files. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure lends credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Lena's history of well-documented and reproducible data in previous studies, which passed an independent audit, supports the notion that she is capable of handling data responsibly and transparently.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have explored different analysis scripts as part of good research practice.\n- She would have documented reasons for excluding participants before submission.\n- The lab would experience technical issues such as software changes and hardware failures.\n- She would have a clean record from previous studies.\n\nAll these factors are consistent with normal, rigorous research practices and the occasional technical issues that can arise. Therefore, it is reasonably likely that these circumstances would occur if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she would still run multiple scripts to cover her tracks or to make it seem like she was exploring different analyses. However, a researcher fabricating data might not necessarily run multiple analyses unless they were attempting to anticipate or respond to potential criticisms or peer review comments.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants for valid reasons (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions) to maintain a veneer of legitimate research practice. The fact that notes predating the journal submission justify these exclusions could be part of her effort to make her actions appear legitimate.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events that could happen regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct. A researcher intent on fabricating or falsifying data might see these as opportunities to explain away inconsistencies or missing data that could raise suspicions.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Someone who commits misconduct might still have a prior clean record if they were previously careful or had not yet felt the need to falsify data. This could be a part of their strategy to avoid detection by initially behaving responsibly.\n\nConsidering these points, the described scenario could still occur even if Lena committed academic misconduct. She might engage in behaviors that appear diligent and transparent to avoid suspicion or to cover her tracks. The occurrence of technical issues like software changes and hardware failures is independent of her actions. Thus, the probability that these events would happen is not necessarily lower just because she committed misconduct.\n\n20"

    "content": "Let's analyze the given information step by step to assess the likelihood of the scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is suspicious and can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a process meant to enhance transparency by documenting the research plan before data analysis. Modifying it after data collection is a red flag for academic misconduct, as it can be used to justify analyses or exclusions that were decided upon after seeing the data. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's unlikely she would modify the preregistration document post-hoc.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: Having an earlier version of the analysis script with more participants could be a sign of exploratory analysis or a genuine change in methodology. However, if the exclusion of these participants wasn't justified or was done post-hoc to achieve desired results, it could be problematic.\n\n4. **Emails expressing pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: The emails reveal that Lena felt pressure and had a vested interest in the study's success. While this pressure might tempt someone to commit misconduct, it doesn't necessarily mean she did. Many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the combination of these factors (especially the suspicious p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection) is quite unlikely. These actions and patterns are more typically associated with misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices.\n\n5"
