    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the components and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: This behavior is in line with good research practice, especially as part of a lab-wide initiative to explore robustness. It suggests a transparent and exploratory approach to data analysis rather than an attempt to manipulate results. The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports that this is a common practice within the lab.\n\n2. **Two participants were excluded based on notes in the raw data files that predated any journal submission**: Excluding participants based on predefined criteria (like not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predated the journal submission indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome was known, reducing the likelihood of this being a post-hoc manipulation to achieve desired results.\n\n3. **The lab switched statistical software packages halfway through the project, and Lena’s laptop hard drive failed**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Labs often change software or tools for various reasons, including updates in methodology or availability of new tools. Hardware failures are also common and can happen to anyone.\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit**: This history is consistent with Lena being a careful and meticulous researcher. It suggests that if she were inclined to misconduct, she might not have been caught before, but it more strongly suggests that she is capable of conducting research with integrity.\n\nGiven these observations and assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect to see behaviors and circumstances that are consistent with good research practices and the natural occurrence of certain events (like hardware failure). All the described behaviors and events are plausible and align with either good research practices or common occurrences in research settings.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that these specific circumstances would occur if Lena did not commit misconduct is relatively high because they are largely explainable by good research practices and common events.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's break down the components:\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she might still run multiple scripts to cover her tracks or to make her eventual choice seem less arbitrary. However, a researcher committing misconduct might be expected to be less likely to leave a clear trail of alternative analyses unless it served to mislead or was part of a strategy to appear transparent.\n\n2. **Two participants were excluded based on notes predating journal submission**: This is a plausible action even for someone who committed misconduct, as it indicates a decision made before the outcome was known, which could be seen as a legitimate reason for exclusion. However, someone committing misconduct might be cautious about leaving a clear paper trail that could be scrutinized.\n\n3. **The lab switched software mid-project and her laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: These events are unrelated to Lena's actions or misconduct directly. They are more related to lab practices and hardware reliability. The occurrence of these events doesn't directly relate to whether or not Lena committed misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Someone who commits misconduct might have a clean record beforehand, as it could be their first instance of misconduct or they might have been careful to avoid detection previously.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the described events could still occur. Running multiple analyses could be part of an attempt to justify a particular result or appear robust. The exclusion of participants based on pre-submission notes could be legitimate or part of the misconduct. The software switch and hard drive failure are unrelated to misconduct directly. A prior clean record is plausible for someone committing misconduct for the first time or being cautious until then.\n\nThe combination of these factors doesn't strongly suggest or rule out misconduct on its own due to their mixed relevance to the issue. However, it's not particularly unlikely that someone committing misconduct could still be associated with these circumstances.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the components:\n\n1. **The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is unusual under normal circumstances because p-values should be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. A high concentration just below .05 can indicate p-hacking or other forms of result manipulation. If Lena did not commit misconduct, observing this pattern is unlikely because it suggests some form of manipulation or bias in reporting results.\n\n2. **The preregistration document was modified after data collection**: Preregistration is a process meant to increase transparency by documenting the research plan before data is collected. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, undermines this purpose and can be a sign of misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's unlikely she would modify the preregistration document in such a significant way post-data collection.\n\n3. **An earlier analysis script included additional participants not in the final dataset**: While this could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in analysis plans, it might also raise suspicions if not properly justified. However, it's not entirely implausible that an earlier version of the analysis included more participants that were later excluded based on legitimate criteria.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: These emails show that Lena felt pressure and had a personal interest in the outcome. While this doesn't directly imply misconduct, it could be seen as a motive. However, having a motive or feeling pressure doesn't necessarily mean someone will commit misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The unusual distribution of p-values is unlikely without some form of manipulation.\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is also unlikely without intent to mislead or manipulate.\n- Having an earlier analysis with more participants is plausible but could raise questions.\n- Expressing pressure and a desire for the study to succeed is understandable and doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, the combination of these specific circumstances is relatively unlikely if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, primarily due to the suspicious p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document.\n\n5"
