    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This timing suggests Alex was not present when the error happened, as they had left the building.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**: It shows Jamie pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, indicating potential rough handling by Jamie.\n\n3. **Printer Model's History**: The printer model has a known issue with its fuser unit and has failed similarly in other departments without evidence of improper handling. This indicates a possible mechanical defect.\n\n4. **Alex's Previous Behavior**: Alex had reported the printer making a grinding noise and had a history of promptly reporting equipment problems. This suggests Alex was not trying to hide issues with the printer and was proactive about maintenance.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The timing of Alex leaving the building before the printer failure, combined with the evidence of Jamie's potentially rough handling of the printer and the printer model's history of mechanical failure, provides alternative explanations for the printer's breakdown.\n- Alex's history of reporting problems with office equipment suggests that if Alex had caused the issue, it's less likely they would have reported the grinding noise beforehand.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors together supports the notion that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n80"

This timing could suggest Alex was not present to cause the failure at the exact moment it happened, but it doesn't rule out Alex causing the failure just before leaving.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**: Shows Jamie handling the printer roughly earlier in the afternoon. While this indicates Jamie interacted with the printer in a potentially damaging way, it doesn't directly implicate or exonerate Alex.\n\n3. **Printer Model's History**: The documented history of the printer model failing in a similar manner in other departments suggests that the failure could be due to a mechanical defect rather than user error or intentional damage.\n\n4. **Alex's Previous Behavior and Reporting**: Alex had previously reported issues with the printer and had a history of reporting equipment problems. This proactive behavior is inconsistent with someone who had just damaged the printer, as one might expect them to be less likely to draw attention to it by reporting problems.\n\nConsidering these factors:\n\n- The fact that Alex left before the failure and had previously reported issues with the printer makes it less likely that Alex broke the printer, as it suggests Alex was not trying to hide the issue.\n- The alternative explanations (Jamie's handling and the printer model's known issues) provide plausible causes other than Alex's actions.\n\nTherefore, given these circumstances, it seems less likely that Alex broke the printer.\n\n20"
