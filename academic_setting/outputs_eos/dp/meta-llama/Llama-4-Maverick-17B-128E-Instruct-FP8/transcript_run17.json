    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To determine the likelihood of the described events occurring if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Lena's prior record**: The fact that Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit suggests that she is generally meticulous with her data. This background supports the plausibility of her not committing misconduct in the current study.\n\n2. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The lab-wide push to explore robustness by running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria explains why Lena's data management logs show such practices. This is consistent with good research practice and is observed in other students as well, making it plausible for Lena to have done the same without any intent of misconduct.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: The exclusion of two participants due to falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, suggests that these decisions were made before the results were known or submitted for publication. This is in line with proper research practices where participant exclusion is based on predefined criteria or observations recorded during data collection.\n\n4. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software and the hard drive failure are external events that could happen in any lab. These are plausible occurrences that are not directly related to Lena's actions or intentions.\n\n5. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Lena's history of maintaining well-documented and reproducible data, as evidenced by an independent audit, supports her credibility and suggests that she is capable of handling data appropriately.\n\nConsidering these points, all the described events are plausible and consistent with good research practices or are explainable by external factors unrelated to misconduct. Therefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that these events would occur as they either reflect good practice or are the result of circumstances that are not indicative of misconduct.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the described events if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's break down the information:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might still run multiple scripts to cover her tracks or to make her results appear more robust. However, the fact that other students did the same as part of a lab-wide practice makes this less directly indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Excluding participants with notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants based on legitimate reasons to make her data handling appear proper. The notes predating the journal submission could be part of her attempt to make her data exclusion appear legitimate.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events that could happen regardless of Lena's actions. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such events, and they do not directly relate to her intentions or actions regarding misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A person committing misconduct in one instance might still have a history of proper data handling, as past behavior does not necessarily predict future actions, especially if the misconduct is a one-time event.\n\nConsidering these points, the events described can occur regardless of whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The fact that she ran multiple analyses and had a prior clean record could be seen as attempts to either genuinely explore data robustness or to cover tracks. The software switch and hard drive failure are unrelated to her actions. Thus, these events are not strongly indicative of either innocence or guilt.\n\n20"

If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely (though not impossible due to chance or other innocent factors) to observe such a pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is used to prevent exactly this kind of issue. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is highly suspicious and indicative of potential misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to legitimate reasons for excluding participants based on predefined criteria. However, if the exclusion criteria were changed (as suggested by the modification of the preregistration document), this could indicate misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena's emails expressing pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: These emails indicate that Lena felt pressure to produce a certain outcome, which is a common motivator for misconduct. However, feeling pressure or having a desire for a study to succeed does not necessarily mean someone will commit misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is unlikely that we would see a combination of suspicious patterns such as an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, significant alterations to the preregistration document post-data collection, and changes in participant inclusion/exclusion that are not clearly justified by legitimate, predefined criteria.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant results, leading to this pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Changing the preregistration after seeing the data is a form of research misconduct as it allows researchers to justify outcomes they prefer. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration document is a likely step to justify her desired outcomes.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might exclude certain participants to achieve desired results or to make her data fit the hypothesis she is testing, which aligns with excluding participants in the final dataset.\n\n4. **Emails expressing pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: These indicate a motive for misconduct. Researchers under pressure might be more inclined to engage in misconduct to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would observe the described patterns:\n- Manipulating or selectively reporting data to achieve significant p-values.\n- Altering the preregistration to fit the outcomes.\n- Excluding participants to achieve the desired result.\n- Expressing pressure and a strong desire for the study to succeed, indicating a motive.\n\nThus, the events described are quite consistent with a scenario where Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n80"
