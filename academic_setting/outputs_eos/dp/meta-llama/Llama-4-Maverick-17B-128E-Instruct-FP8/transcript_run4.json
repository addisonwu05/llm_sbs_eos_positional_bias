    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information provided step by step:\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is consistent with a lab-wide push to explore robustness and is not unusual in research settings where researchers often test the robustness of their findings by varying analysis parameters. Other students showing similar patterns supports that this is a common practice in the lab.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants based on predefined criteria (like not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predating the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are plausible events that can happen in any research project due to various reasons such as updates in lab practices, software compatibility issues, or hardware failures. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A clean record indicates that Lena has previously handled data responsibly, supporting the notion that she might not have committed misconduct in the current study.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She followed lab practices by running multiple analyses.\n- The exclusion of participants was based on legitimate reasons documented before the journal submission.\n- The lab experienced a software switch and a hardware failure, which are unfortunate but possible events.\n- She had a history of good data handling practices.\n\nAll these factors together suggest that the observed behaviors and events could reasonably occur without any misconduct on Lena's part.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This could be seen as either a genuine attempt to test the robustness of the findings or, if Lena committed misconduct, as part of fabricating or manipulating data to achieve desired results. However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this is a common lab practice.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on legitimate reasons with notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, one might expect her to fabricate reasons for excluding participants or to do so in a way that is not transparent. The fact that the exclusions are based on clear, documented reasons that predate the journal submission actually suggests a level of transparency and adherence to good research practice.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct. They are more related to lab practices and hardware issues than to Lena's behavior.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's somewhat unexpected that she would have a prior record of clean data handling, as this might suggest a pattern of behavior. However, it's not impossible for someone to behave impeccably in the past and then commit misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, several of the observed facts (like the lab switching software, hard drive failure, and prior clean record) are not directly related to her actions in this specific case. The fact that she ran multiple analyses and excluded participants with documented reasons could be seen as either good practice or, potentially, as part of a larger scheme to manipulate data, but the transparency and adherence to lab practices here leans more towards good practice.\n\nHowever, a person committing misconduct might still follow some good practices to avoid detection or to make their actions seem legitimate. Thus, the likelihood of these events occurring if Lena committed misconduct is not extremely low, because some of these actions and events are not directly indicative of misconduct and could occur regardless.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is suspicious and can indicate p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern by chance alone.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to increase transparency by specifying the analysis plan before seeing the data. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is generally considered a questionable practice and can be a sign of misconduct if done to achieve significant results.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: While having different versions of analysis scripts with varying inclusions or exclusions of participants can be a legitimate part of exploring data robustness, doing so in a way that significantly alters the conclusions could raise suspicions.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: Lena's emails suggest she felt pressure and had a personal interest in the study succeeding. While this indicates motivation, it doesn't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often have stakes in their work, but it becomes concerning if actions taken to ensure success violate research ethics.\n\nConsidering these points, the combination of a suspicious pattern of p-values, post-data collection modifications to the preregistration, and indications of personal and professional pressure makes it less likely that all these conditions would be met without any academic misconduct on Lena's part. The described behaviors and outcomes are more characteristic of misconduct or, at the very least, highly questionable research practices.\n\n5"
