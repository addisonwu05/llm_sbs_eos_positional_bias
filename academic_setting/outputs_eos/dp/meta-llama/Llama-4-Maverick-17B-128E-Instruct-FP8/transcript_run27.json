    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

It supports the notion that Alex did not cause the failure, as they were not present.\n\n2. **Security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper**: This indicates that Jamie interacted with the printer in a potentially damaging manner before it failed. It provides an alternative explanation for the printer's failure, suggesting that someone else (Jamie) might have caused or contributed to the problem.\n\n3. **The printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments**: This information strongly supports the idea that the printer's failure could be due to a mechanical defect or a known issue with the model rather than user error or intentional damage.\n\n4. **Alex had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems**: This history suggests that Alex is diligent about reporting issues and is not someone who would ignore or cause problems with equipment without reporting them.\n\nConsidering these points, the evidence collectively supports the likelihood that Alex did not break the printer. The fact that Alex was not in the building when the printer failed, combined with evidence of Jamie's potentially damaging interaction with the printer, the known mechanical issues with the printer model, and Alex's history of responsible behavior regarding office equipment, all contribute to this conclusion.\n\n80"

While it doesn't rule out that Alex caused the damage before leaving, it makes it less likely that the act was done immediately before the failure.\n\n2. **Security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper**: This introduces an alternative potential cause for the printer's failure, suggesting that Jamie might have been responsible. It doesn't directly implicate Alex but does provide a plausible alternative explanation.\n\n3. **The printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments**: This information provides a non-user-related explanation for the failure, suggesting that the breakdown could have been due to a manufacturing defect or design flaw rather than user error.\n\n4. **Alex had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems**: This history indicates that Alex is proactive about reporting issues. If Alex had broken the printer, it's counterintuitive that they would have reported the earlier issue and then caused the subsequent failure, given their pattern of behavior.\n\nIf Alex did break the printer, the fact that they left the building before the failure and had a history of reporting issues makes it less likely that they would have then caused the failure in a way that didn't get reported. However, the provided information doesn't directly prove or disprove Alex's involvement in breaking the printer.

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

It is a strong circumstantial evidence against Alex.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat about being frustrated with the printer**: Alex's statement about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again could imply a potential for reckless or angry behavior towards the printer. This, combined with the fact that coworkers reacted with laughing emojis, might suggest that Alex's frustration was somewhat public and acknowledged.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray were found in Alex’s trash**: This is a significant piece of circumstantial evidence. If the fragments are indeed from the printer, it suggests that Alex might have handled the broken part and then disposed of it.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day, then later corrected themselves**: Alex's initial denial followed by a correction could indicate dishonesty or an attempt to distance themselves from the incident. This change in statement might undermine Alex's credibility.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence now leans towards suggesting that Alex could have been involved in the printer's failure. The combination of being at the scene, expressing frustration, having potentially incriminating evidence in their trash, and being inconsistent in their statements all contribute to a lower likelihood that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n20"
