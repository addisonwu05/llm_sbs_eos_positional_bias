    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario under the condition that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the probability of each piece of evidence occurring given her innocence and then synthesize this information.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is consistent with good research practice, especially in a context where exploring robustness is encouraged. It's plausible that Lena, like other students, was following lab practices or exploring the robustness of her findings. **Likelihood: High**\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants based on predefined criteria (e.g., not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. If the notes are genuine and predate the submission, this supports the legitimacy of her actions. **Likelihood: High**\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failing**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Labs often change software for various reasons (e.g., new features, compatibility, or funding changes). Hardware failures are also common. **Likelihood: Moderate to High**\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This directly supports Lena's credibility and suggests that she is capable of handling data properly. **Likelihood: High**\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She followed lab practices by running multiple analyses.\n- She excluded participants based on legitimate, pre-defined criteria.\n- The lab experienced a software change and she suffered a hardware failure, which are unfortunate but possible events.\n- She had a history of good data handling practices.\n\nGiven these are largely independent events (except the lab software change which could be related to other lab practices), the probability of all occurring can be considered by assessing the overall narrative they create.\n\nThe narrative is one of a researcher following good practices, having bad luck with hardware, and being part of a lab with certain practices. The likelihood of all these occurring under the assumption of Lena's innocence is relatively high because they either align with good research practices or are plausible events.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario under the condition that Lena committed academic misconduct, let's examine each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This could be seen as either good practice or an attempt to find a favorable analysis. If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple analyses to either genuinely explore robustness or to find a version that supports her desired outcome. **Likelihood: Moderate to High**\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on legitimate criteria with notes predating journal submission**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's still plausible she could have legitimately excluded participants. However, a manipulator might fabricate or alter exclusion criteria. The fact that notes predate submission could be genuine or fabricated. **Likelihood: Moderate**\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failing**: These events are unrelated to Lena's actions directly. A researcher committing misconduct might still experience hardware failure or be part of a lab that switches software. **Likelihood: Moderate to High**\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she hadn't been caught or hadn't misconducted in previous studies. This could indicate either that she hadn't previously committed misconduct or was more careful then. **Likelihood: High**\n\nHowever, the key here is whether these events collectively are likely if Lena committed misconduct. A person committing misconduct might:\n- Still follow some good practices (e.g., running multiple analyses, documenting exclusions) either out of habit, to cover their tracks, or because they are used to doing so from previous honest work.\n- Experience unrelated events like hardware failure or lab software changes.\n\nThe combination of these factors doesn't directly point to or strongly against misconduct. The prior clean record could be seen as either genuine or indicative of not being caught previously.\n\n20"

If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to see such a pattern by chance, especially across multiple analyses. **Likelihood: Low**\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to prevent exactly this kind of issue.

If Lena was innocent, she might still make legitimate changes to the dataset, but doing so without a clear, pre-specified reason could be seen as suspicious. **Likelihood: Moderate**\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to “work”**: While these statements show motivation and pressure, they don't directly indicate misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure to publish or secure grants. **Likelihood: High**\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The suspicious pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document post-data collection are unlikely under innocence.\n- The exclusion of participants seen in the earlier analysis script could be legitimate or not, depending on the reasons.\n- The emails reflect a genuine feeling of pressure.\n\nThe combination of these, especially the first two points, makes the scenario less likely under the assumption of innocence due to their suspicious nature.\n\n5"
