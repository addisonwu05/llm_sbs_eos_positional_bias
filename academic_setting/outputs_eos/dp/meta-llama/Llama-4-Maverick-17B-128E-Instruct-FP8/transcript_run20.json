    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Additionally, Alex's proactive reporting of issues aligns with a lower likelihood of them being responsible for the breakdown.\n\n85"

However, it's possible Alex caused the damage just before leaving.\n\n2. **Security camera footage showing Jamie pulling on a jammed sheet**: While this indicates Jamie handled the printer roughly, it doesn't directly implicate or exonerate Alex. It provides an alternative potential cause.\n\n3. **Printer model's documented history of failing**: This suggests the failure could be due to a mechanical issue rather than user error, making it less likely that Alex's actions caused the failure.\n\n4. **Alex's email about the grinding noise and history of reporting issues**: This history suggests Alex is diligent and not prone to causing damage through neglect or intent, as they report problems.\n\nConsidering Alex's history of responsible behavior and the timing of their departure relative to the printer failure, the fact that they badged out before the failure is a strong indicator they didn't cause it. However, the presence of small plastic fragments under Alex's desk remains a suspicious circumstance not directly explained by the other evidence.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially Alex's prior responsible behavior and the plausible alternative explanations for the printer's failure (Jamie's rough handling and the printer model's known issues)—makes it somewhat unlikely that Alex broke the printer.\n\nHowever, given the circumstantial evidence (like the plastic fragments under Alex's desk) that isn't directly addressed by the other factors, it's not a certainty that Alex didn't break the printer.\n\n20"
