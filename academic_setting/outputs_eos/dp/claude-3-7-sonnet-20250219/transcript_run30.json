    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the probability that all these events would occur if Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to consider how likely each element is independently and collectively.\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is fairly common in research, especially given the lab's \"push to explore robustness\" and the fact that other students show similar patterns. This isn't unusual for legitimate research.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with predating notes: This is very common in cognitive studies. Participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions are routinely excluded, and the fact that these notes predate submission strongly suggests legitimate exclusion.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: Technology changes and failures happen regularly in research settings. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, giving this independent verification.\n\n4. Clean prior record: If Lena is generally meticulous and honest, this is exactly what we'd expect to see in her history.\n\nNone of these elements are particularly unusual, and they're consistent with normal research processes and challenges. The fact that there's external verification for several elements (IT confirmation, similar patterns from other students, independent audit of prior work) makes them more credible.\n\nGiven all this information, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of observing this constellation of events is quite high.\n\n85"

    "content": "To evaluate the probability if Lena did commit misconduct, I need to consider each piece of evidence from that perspective:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different criteria: If committing misconduct, having multiple versions could be part of p-hacking or fishing for significant results. This would be fairly likely for someone manipulating data.\n\n2. Excluded participants with predating notes: Even someone committing fraud would likely exclude problematic participants legitimately. The predating notes could still exist if the misconduct occurred in other aspects of the analysis.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These events are independent of misconduct - technology changes and failures happen regardless. However, a convenient hard drive failure could potentially serve as cover for missing files that might reveal misconduct.\n\n4. Clean prior record: This makes current misconduct somewhat less likely, as it suggests a departure from established behavior, but people can change under pressure.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, most of these circumstances could still exist, though the clean prior record creates some tension with this hypothesis. The software switch and hard drive failure would be coincidental but not impossible.\n\n60"

Concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above: This pattern is statistically unusual and commonly associated with p-hacking. Without misconduct, this distribution would be extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. Modifying preregistration after data collection: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data violates the purpose of preregistration and is a serious methodological issue. While honest mistakes happen, this specific change is highly problematic.\n\n3. Earlier analysis including additional participants later excluded: While legitimate exclusions happen, this pattern combined with the other evidence raises concerns about selective removal to achieve desired results.\n\n4. Emails about needing the study to \"work\": These statements reveal strong motivation and pressure, which doesn't prove misconduct but demonstrates clear outcome-driven incentives.\n\nIf completely innocent, this combination of statistical anomalies, preregistration changes, and expressed pressure would be extraordinarily unlikely to co-occur.\n\n10"
