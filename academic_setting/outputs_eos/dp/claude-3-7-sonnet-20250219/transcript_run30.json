    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The printer's known defects and Jamie's rough handling provide plausible alternative explanations for the failure. Alex's prior reporting of the printer issue and history of properly reporting equipment problems are consistent with someone who respects office equipment.\n\nThe plastic fragments under Alex's desk remain unexplained, but could be unrelated to the printer or from earlier in the day before the printer broke.\n\nGiven all these factors, it's highly likely these events would occur if Alex did not break the printer.\n\n95"

Unless the printer log or badge system was inaccurate, or unless Alex damaged it in a way that took exactly 7 minutes to register a failure, it's very unlikely Alex was responsible.\n\n15"

Coworker saw Alex at the printer 5 minutes before failure: This directly contradicts the earlier timeline where Alex badged out 7 minutes before the failure. Either the badge records, printer logs, or witness observation has an inaccuracy.\n\n2. Alex's threatening message about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again: While this could be innocent venting, it establishes motive and intent.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray in Alex's trash: This is highly incriminating physical evidence. If Alex didn't break the printer, it's difficult to explain how these fragments ended up in their personal trash.\n\n4. Alex's contradictory statements about printer use: Changing their story suggests potential dishonesty or attempted concealment.\n\nFor these events to occur while Alex is innocent would require:\n- A timing error in badge records, printer logs, or witness observation\n- Alex venting frustration without acting on it\n- Someone else planting evidence in Alex's trash\n- Alex being genuinely confused about their printer use that day\n\nThe plastic fragments in particular are extremely difficult to explain if Alex is innocent. Combined with the threatening message and contradictory statements, this creates a pattern that would be very unlikely if Alex were not involved.\n\n10"
