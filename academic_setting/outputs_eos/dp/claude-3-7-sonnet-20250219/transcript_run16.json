    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to assess the likelihood of these events if Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct.\n\nLet me analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be standard practice in the lab (\"lab-wide push to explore robustness\") and other students show similar patterns. This would be entirely expected regardless of misconduct.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with documentation predating submission: This is proper scientific procedure - excluding participants with valid reasons and documenting it contemporaneously. This strongly supports proper conduct.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These technical issues were independently verified by IT. Computer failures are common, and software changes happen in labs. This would occur regardless of misconduct.\n\n4. Prior clean record with well-documented data: Her history shows consistently good practices in data management. This suggests she understands and follows proper research protocols.\n\nAll of these observations are consistent with normal research practices and challenges. None are unexpected if Lena is innocent. The combination of these events would be quite likely for any researcher conducting legitimate work over time.\n\n75"

This would be expected whether guilty or innocent, especially since others in the lab do the same.\n\nThe legitimate exclusion of two participants with contemporaneous notes is somewhat less expected if committing fraud (a fraudster might not bother with proper documentation), but still possible.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure could potentially be convenient cover for missing files that might reveal misconduct, though the IT confirmation suggests this was a genuine hardware issue.\n\nHer prior clean record makes misconduct less likely but doesn't preclude it - researchers with good reputations sometimes commit misconduct due to pressure.\n\nOverall, while these observations don't contradict misconduct, they don't strongly support it either. Some elements (like the documented exclusions and clean prior record) would be somewhat less likely to occur together with misconduct.\n\n45"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these new pieces of evidence would be if Lena did NOT commit misconduct.\n\nThe distribution of p-values clustered just below .05 with very few just above .05 is statistically unlikely to occur naturally. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation, as researchers typically try different analyses until finding significant results.\n\nModifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and outcomes is a serious violation of research protocols. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data.\n\nHaving additional participants in an earlier analysis script who were later excluded without clear documentation is concerning, especially combined with the modified preregistration.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and the need for the study to \"work\" provide motive. While feeling pressure is normal, stating \"I need this one to work\" suggests potential willingness to ensure positive results.\n\nThese four elements together would be extremely unlikely in the absence of misconduct. Each individually raises concerns, but collectively they form a pattern that would be very improbable without some form of data manipulation.\n\n5"
