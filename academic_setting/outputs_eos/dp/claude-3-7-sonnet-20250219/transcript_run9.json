    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the probability that all these events would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, I'll evaluate each element's likelihood:\n\n1. Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be standard practice in the lab (\"lab-wide push to explore robustness\"), with other students showing similar patterns. This is quite likely in legitimate research exploring robustness.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with notes predating submission: This is normal scientific practice and the documentation predates submission, which strongly suggests legitimate exclusion.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and hard drive failure: These are independent events that happen with moderate frequency in research environments. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data: If Lena is honest in her research practices, this is exactly what we would expect to see.\n\nNone of these elements are particularly unusual in academic research. The software switch, participant exclusions, and multiple analyses are common. Hard drive failures happen occasionally. And someone with integrity would likely have a consistent record of good data management.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of seeing this constellation of events is reasonably high.\n\n75"

    "content": "To assess this probability, I need to consider each element in the scenario assuming Lena did commit misconduct:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: If Lena committed misconduct, having multiple versions could actually be consistent with p-hacking or trying different analyses until getting desired results. This wouldn't be unusual.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with predated notes: Even if committing misconduct, these could be legitimate exclusions, or she could have backdated notes. Either way, this is plausible.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and hard drive failure: These events seem independent of misconduct. The hardware failure was confirmed by IT. Such technical issues could provide convenient cover for missing files that might show evidence of misconduct.\n\n4. Prior record of clean data: This suggests she may have only recently turned to misconduct, perhaps due to the pressure of this high-profile study with her supervisor needing results. Many researchers who commit misconduct have clean prior records.\n\nNone of these elements strongly contradict the possibility of misconduct in this specific case. The combination of these circumstances, while not proving misconduct, is certainly compatible with it.\n\n60"
