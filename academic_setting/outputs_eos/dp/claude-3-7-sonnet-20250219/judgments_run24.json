  "Based on the available evidence, I believe Alex likely broke the printer. The timing of Alex being seen at the printer shortly before it failed, the threatening message about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again, the plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's trash, and Alex's inconsistent statements about using the printer that day all strongly suggest Alex's involvement. While there are alternative explanations (printer's known defects, Jamie's rough handling), the preponderance of evidence points toward Alex being responsible for the damage.\n\nYes"
