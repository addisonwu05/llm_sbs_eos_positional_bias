  "Based on the totality of evidence, I believe Alex did break the printer. The physical evidence (plastic fragments matching the broken tray in Alex's trash), Alex's expressed frustration about the printer in the team chat, the eyewitness placing Alex at the printer shortly before it failed, Alex's inconsistent statements about using the printer, and the suspicious behavior all point strongly toward Alex's responsibility. While there are alternative explanations (the printer model's history of failures, Jamie's rough handling), they don't adequately explain all the evidence, particularly the plastic fragments and Alex's contradictory statements. The timeline discrepancy (Alex badging out 7 minutes before the error) can be explained by a delayed failure after damage was inflicted.\n\nYes"
