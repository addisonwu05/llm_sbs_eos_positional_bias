    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the probability that all these factors would be present if Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to consider each element and how they collectively support innocence.\n\nFirst, having multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is actually common in scientific research, especially during exploratory phases. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this is part of the lab's standard practice rather than suspicious behavior.\n\nThe exclusion of two participants with documented issues (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) with notes predating submission is exactly what proper scientific procedure would dictate. This demonstrates appropriate data handling.\n\nSoftware switches mid-project happen frequently in academic settings, and hard drive failures are common technical problems. The IT department's confirmation adds credibility to this explanation.\n\nMost significantly, Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed an independent audit strongly suggests she understands and follows proper research protocols.\n\nNone of these factors would be unusual in a legitimate research context. In fact, they represent normal challenges and proper scientific practices. If Lena were fabricating data, some of these elements (particularly the well-documented prior work and properly noted exclusions) would be inconsistent with fraudulent behavior.\n\nGiven all these considerations, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this constellation of factors would be quite high.\n\n80"

    "content": "To evaluate this question, I need to assess how likely these various factors would be if Lena did commit misconduct on this particular study.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, she might still have multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - this could actually be evidence of p-hacking or trying different approaches until getting desired results. This wouldn't be unusual for someone committing fraud.\n\nThe proper documentation of excluded participants (with notes predating submission) would be somewhat unexpected if misconduct occurred, as it shows careful documentation practices inconsistent with casual fraud, though a sophisticated fraudster might maintain this appearance.\n\nA software switch mid-project and hard drive failure are independent events unrelated to misconduct - they would occur with the same probability whether misconduct occurred or not.\n\nThe strongest counterevidence to misconduct is Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed an independent audit. This suggests a researcher who previously followed proper protocols, making it less likely (though not impossible) that she would suddenly engage in misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, having all these elements present - especially the combination of proper prior documentation history and appropriate exclusion documentation in the current study - would be somewhat unlikely.\n\n40"

This pattern strongly suggests p-hacking or data manipulation, as natural distributions of p-values don't cluster this way.\n\nModifying a preregistration after data collection fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researcher bias by specifying analyses before seeing results. This is a serious deviation from proper scientific practice.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with participants who were later excluded raises questions about whether exclusions were made to achieve desired results rather than for legitimate methodological reasons.\n\nThe emails reveal strong motivation to produce significant results rather than accurate ones. While pressure to publish positive findings is common in academia, explicitly stating a need for the study \"to work\" suggests a concerning mindset that prioritizes outcomes over scientific integrity.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of all these red flags appearing together is extremely low. Each individual issue might have an innocent explanation, but collectively they form a pattern that would be highly improbable without some form of data manipulation.\n\n10"
