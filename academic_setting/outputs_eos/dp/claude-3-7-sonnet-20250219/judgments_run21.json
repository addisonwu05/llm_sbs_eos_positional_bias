  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Alex did break the printer.\n\nThe physical evidence is compelling - plastic fragments matching the broken printer tray were found in Alex's trash, and a coworker saw Alex at the printer just before it failed. Alex's behavior is also suspicious - expressing frustration about the printer in the team chat (\"going to lose it\"), initially denying using the printer at all that day, then changing their story.\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors (the printer model's history of failures, the timeline showing Alex badged out before the official error time), the combination of physical evidence, eyewitness placement, expressed frustration, and inconsistent statements strongly suggests Alex damaged the printer in a moment of frustration.\n\nYes"
