  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- Physical evidence: plastic fragments matching the printer's broken tray found in Alex's trash\n- Proximity: a witness saw Alex at the printer just before it stopped working\n- Motive: Alex publicly expressed frustration with the printer, stating they would \"lose it\" if it jammed again\n- Suspicious behavior: Alex initially denied using the printer that day, then changed their story\n- Timeline inconsistencies: the badge logs show Alex left 7 minutes before the error, but a coworker saw them at the printer 5 minutes before failure\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors (the printer model's history of failures, Jamie's rough handling earlier), the physical evidence combined with Alex's proximity, expressed frustration, and dishonest statements strongly suggest Alex is responsible for damaging the printer.\n\nYes"
