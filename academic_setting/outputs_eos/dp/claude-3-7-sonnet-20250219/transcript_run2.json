    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to analyze how likely this constellation of events would be under the hypothesis that Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe lab's data management logs showing multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria is quite common in exploratory research, especially during robustness checks. This practice is actually consistent with transparent research methods, and the fact that other students show similar patterns makes this unremarkable.\n\nExcluding two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is standard practice, and importantly, these exclusions were documented before journal submission. This is exactly what we'd expect in properly conducted research.\n\nSoftware transitions mid-project happen frequently in labs, and hardware failures like hard drive crashes are common events. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, which provides independent verification.\n\nLena's prior clean record with well-documented data that passed an independent audit strongly suggests she understands and follows proper research protocols.\n\nNone of these events are unusual in academic research settings, and they all have straightforward explanations that don't require misconduct. These circumstances would be quite likely in the normal course of research, regardless of whether misconduct occurred or not.\n\n85"

This practice isn't unusual and could serve as cover for selective reporting of favorable results.\n\nThe properly documented participant exclusions that predate submission are somewhat inconsistent with misconduct, as they show proper documentation practices. However, a researcher planning to commit fraud might still maintain proper documentation in some areas to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure could potentially be convenient circumstances for someone attempting to hide evidence of data manipulation, though the IT confirmation makes the hard drive failure itself likely genuine.\n\nHer prior clean record makes misconduct less expected but doesn't rule it out - researchers with previously good records can still commit misconduct, especially under pressure from a high-profile study with a supervisor expecting positive results.\n\nWhile some of these circumstances would be unusual for someone committing fraud (particularly the well-documented exclusions), others might be exploited as part of or cover for misconduct.\n\n60"

Proper preregistration should be finalized before data collection begins to prevent researchers from changing analyses based on what they've seen in the data.\n\nAn unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally. This pattern is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or data manipulation, as true effects would produce a more even distribution of p-values.\n\nThe earlier analysis script including participants who were later excluded suggests potential selection of participants to achieve desired outcomes, especially concerning when combined with the modified preregistration.\n\nLena's emails reveal significant pressure and motivation to produce positive results, including concerns about her career prospects. While feeling pressure doesn't automatically lead to misconduct, these statements demonstrate clear motivation for potential misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, this combination of statistical anomalies, documentation irregularities, and expressed career pressure would be extremely unlikely to occur together.\n\n5"
