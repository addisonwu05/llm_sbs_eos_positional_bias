    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This is strong evidence that Alex couldn't have caused the final breakdown since they weren't physically present.\n\nSecond, there's evidence of another potential cause: Jamie was seen on camera pulling forcefully on a jammed paper, which could have damaged the printer.\n\nThird, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments without improper handling, suggesting a design flaw.\n\nFourth, Alex had previously reported concerns about the printer's condition, showing awareness of potential issues and responsible behavior regarding equipment maintenance.\n\nThe small plastic fragments under Alex's desk remain unexplained, but could be unrelated or from earlier interactions with the printer before it fully failed.\n\nGiven that Alex was not present when the printer failed, another person was seen roughly handling the printer, the model has known defects, and Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment issues, it is highly likely that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n95"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk.

This timing discrepancy is significant.\n\nAlex's changing story about printer usage (first denying use, then admitting possible morning use) suggests potential dishonesty or confusion, which doesn't align well with innocence.\n\nThe team chat message showing Alex's frustration with the printer and saying they would \"lose it\" indicates a motive, though this could be just typical workplace venting.\n\nMost concerning are the plastic fragments in Alex's trash can that match the broken printer tray. This physical evidence directly links Alex to the damage if they are indeed from the printer.\n\nThese new pieces of evidence significantly undermine the case for Alex's innocence. While the badge-out time remains puzzling if Alex did break the printer, the physical evidence, changed story, and documented frustration make it much less likely that Alex is innocent.\n\n20"
