    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate this question, I need to assess how likely these observations would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nLooking at each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be standard practice in the lab, as other students show similar patterns and it was part of a lab-wide robustness initiative. This would be expected regardless of misconduct.\n\n2. Participant exclusions with documentation predating submission: Having contemporaneous notes about participant issues (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) that predate any submission is consistent with proper scientific practice, and would be expected in honest research.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: Technical issues happen in research settings regardless of researcher integrity. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, giving this credibility.\n\n4. Prior clean record with well-documented data: If Lena has a history of good data management that passed independent audit, this suggests she knows and follows proper research practices.\n\nIf Lena were innocent, all of these observations would be quite likely to occur in some combination. None of these events are particularly unusual in research settings. The combination might seem coincidental, but they're largely independent events that don't appear particularly suspicious.\n\n75"

This behavior wouldn't look different from legitimate exploratory analysis.\n\nThe excluded participants with predating notes could be legitimate even in a case of misconduct - real exclusions might exist alongside fabricated data.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure could potentially serve as convenient cover for missing files that might have revealed inconsistencies, though the IT confirmation makes this less suspicious.\n\nHer prior clean record makes misconduct less expected, but doesn't rule it out - researchers with good histories can still engage in misconduct, especially under pressure.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, many of these circumstances could either be unrelated to the misconduct or potentially leveraged as part of a cover-up.\n\n55"

    "content": "To evaluate this scenario where Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to assess how likely these new pieces of evidence would be under innocent circumstances:\n\n1. The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically very suspicious. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking and would be extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\n2. Modifying a preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration and is a serious breach of research protocol.\n\n3. Excluding participants who were in earlier analysis versions without clear documentation is concerning, especially in conjunction with the other issues.\n\n4. The emails show clear motivation and pressure to produce significant results, regardless of what the data actually showed.\n\nIf Lena were innocent, these patterns would be very difficult to explain through honest errors or coincidences. The clustering of p-values just below .05 is particularly damning from a statistical perspective, and changing preregistered analyses after seeing the data violates fundamental principles of confirmatory research.\n\n5"
