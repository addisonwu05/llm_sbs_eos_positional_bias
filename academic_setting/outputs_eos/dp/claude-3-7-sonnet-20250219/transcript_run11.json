    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To answer this question, I need to evaluate how likely these observed pieces of evidence would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nFirst, regarding the multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is actually quite common in research, especially as part of a lab-wide robustness initiative. Researchers often explore various analytical approaches, which is good scientific practice when done transparently. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly suggests this is standard practice in the lab.\n\nExcluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is completely standard practice, and the documentation predating journal submission indicates proper protocol was followed.\n\nSoftware switches mid-project happen frequently in research labs, especially as better tools become available. Similarly, hard drive failures are common technical issues that researchers face. The IT department's confirmation provides independent verification that this genuinely occurred.\n\nFinally, Lena's prior clean record is important context - researchers who maintain good data practices typically continue to do so. The independent audit that rated her previous work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggests she has established good research practices.\n\nNone of these events is particularly unusual in academic research, and they all have ordinary explanations that would be expected whether or not misconduct occurred. The combination of these circumstances is quite plausible in the absence of misconduct.\n\n75"

This would be somewhat expected from someone manipulating data.\n\nThe proper documentation of excluded participants with notes predating submission could be part of building a consistent story around manipulated data, though the timing makes this less suspicious.\n\nA software switch mid-project and hard drive failure could potentially serve as convenient explanations for data inconsistencies or missing files that might otherwise reveal manipulation. However, the IT department's confirmation makes this a verified event rather than just an excuse.\n\nThe most contradictory element is Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented research that passed an independent audit. People who commit misconduct often have previous instances of questionable practices, so this clean prior record would be somewhat unexpected if she committed fraud in the current study.\n\nGiven these considerations, while some elements might align with potential misconduct, others (particularly her clean prior record and independently verified technical issues) make the overall constellation of evidence less likely if she did commit misconduct.\n\n45"

    "content": "I need to assess how likely these observations would be if Lena did NOT commit misconduct.\n\nThe unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical red flag for p-hacking. This pattern is highly unlikely to occur naturally in multiple analyses and strongly suggests selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\nModifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes violates the fundamental purpose of preregistration, which is to establish analysis plans before seeing the data. This is a serious breach of research protocol if done intentionally.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with participants who were later excluded could be innocent if there were legitimate reasons for exclusion, but combined with the other evidence, it raises concerns about selective participant removal to achieve desired results.\n\nThe emails expressing career pressure and explicitly stating \"I need this one to work\" reveal strong motivation for misconduct. While feeling pressure isn't misconduct itself, it establishes a clear motive when combined with the other evidence.\n\nFor all these observations to exist without any misconduct would require multiple unusual circumstances: a natural but extremely improbable distribution of p-values, legitimate but poorly documented reasons to change preregistration, valid but coincidentally beneficial participant exclusions, and expressing pressure without acting on it.\n\n15"
