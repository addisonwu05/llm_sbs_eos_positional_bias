  "Based on the available evidence, I believe Alex most likely did break the printer. The timing of Alex being at the printer shortly before it failed, the plastic fragments matching the printer's broken parts found in Alex's trash, Alex's expressed frustration in the team chat, and the inconsistent statements about printer use all strongly suggest Alex's involvement.
