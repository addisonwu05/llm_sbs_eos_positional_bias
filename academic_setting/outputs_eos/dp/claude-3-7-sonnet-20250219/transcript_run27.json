    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate this question, I need to consider how likely these observations are if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nLet me analyze each element:\n\n1) Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is actually common practice in research, especially with a lab-wide push for robustness testing. If Lena is innocent, we would expect her to follow lab protocols and explore various analyses like her colleagues did.\n\n2) Excluding participants who fell asleep/didn't understand instructions: This is standard practice in cognitive research. The fact that these notes predate submission is important evidence supporting legitimate exclusion.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These technical issues happen in research settings regardless of research integrity. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, giving this external validation.\n\n4) Prior clean record with well-documented data: If Lena is meticulous and honest in her work, we would expect a consistent pattern of proper documentation throughout her research history.\n\nNone of these observations seem unlikely under the hypothesis that Lena is innocent. In fact, they align with normal research practices and explainable technical issues. The multiple analysis scripts might raise flags in some contexts, but here they were part of a lab-wide practice with other students showing similar patterns.\n\n75"

    "content": "To assess this question, I need to consider how likely these observations would be if Lena did commit misconduct.\n\nFor a researcher engaging in misconduct:\n1) Multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria could actually be consistent with p-hacking or trying different approaches until getting desired results. This practice isn't unusual even among researchers engaging in questionable practices.\n\n2) The excluded participants with notes predating submission is interesting. A researcher planning misconduct might still properly document legitimate exclusions to maintain appearance of rigor.\n\n3) The software switch and hard drive failure could potentially provide convenient cover for data irregularities, though the IT confirmation suggests this was a genuine issue.\n\n4) Having a previously clean record is very common for researchers who later commit misconduct - most researchers with misconduct cases don't have prior violations. First-time offenders are common.\n\nNone of these observations definitively rule out misconduct. The pressure from Professor Mills for publishable results creates motivation, and the \"too perfect\" data flagged by the whistleblower remains concerning despite these explanations.\n\nWhile some elements might be expected with misconduct (multiple analyses), others (confirmed hardware failure, consistent documentation practices) would be somewhat coincidental if misconduct occurred.\n\n60"

    "content": "To evaluate this scenario assuming Lena did NOT commit misconduct:\n\n1) The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically unusual and typically a red flag for p-hacking in research. This pattern rarely occurs naturally in legitimate analyses.\n\n2) Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes violates fundamental principles of preregistration, which exists specifically to prevent post-hoc adjustments.\n\n3) Earlier analysis scripts with additional participants who were later excluded could be innocent if there were legitimate reasons for exclusion, but combined with the modified preregistration, this suggests potential data manipulation.\n\n4) The emails showing career pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" reveal strong motivation to produce positive results, though motivation alone doesn't prove misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors - especially the p-value distribution and modified preregistration - is extremely unlikely without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting. While career pressure exists for many researchers, the statistical anomalies and protocol violations are difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\n5"
