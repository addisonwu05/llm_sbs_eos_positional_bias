    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The fact that Alex complained about jamming earlier is consistent with both the printer having pre-existing issues and Jamie's observed rough handling.\n\nGiven that Alex wasn't even in the building when the failure occurred, Jamie was seen handling the printer roughly, and the printer model has known defects, the evidence strongly supports Alex's innocence.\n\n95"

Alex badging out 7 minutes before the critical error is somewhat unusual. This timing would require either a delayed failure after Alex damaged it, or Alex somehow damaging it remotely.\n2. Jamie's rough handling of the printer earlier is coincidental or contributory but not the primary cause.\n3. The printer's documented history of failures could be irrelevant or could have made it more vulnerable to damage.\n4. Alex's previous email about grinding noises could be either genuine concern or setting up plausible deniability.\n5. Alex's history of reporting equipment problems doesn't align well with someone who would deliberately break equipment.\n\nThe plastic fragments under Alex's desk are significant evidence pointing toward Alex, but the timing of Alex's departure before the failure and the other contextual factors make Alex breaking the printer somewhat unlikely.\n\n25"

Alex was seen near the printer just before it stopped working, with no one else approaching - This is difficult to reconcile with innocence, especially combined with the fact that Alex left the building shortly afterward.\n2. Alex posted about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This shows frustration that could be innocent, but suggests a motive.\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray were found in Alex's trash - This is very difficult to explain if Alex is innocent.\n4.

We also know Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error, which is the strongest point in Alex's favor.\n\nWhile the printer model does have a history of failures and Jamie was seen handling it roughly earlier, the combination of Alex's presence right before the failure, the threatening message, the plastic fragments in Alex's trash, and the changing story make innocence quite unlikely.\n\n15"
