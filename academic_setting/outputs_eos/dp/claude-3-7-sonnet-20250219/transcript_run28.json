    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to assess the likelihood of these events occurring if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nLooking at each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be common practice in the lab as part of robustness testing, so this would be highly likely regardless of misconduct.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with documentation predating submission: This represents standard, well-documented exclusion practices that would be expected in careful research.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These are external events confirmed by IT and would occur independently of any misconduct.\n\n4. Prior clean record with well-documented data: This establishes a pattern of proper research conduct before this incident.\n\nNone of these events seem particularly unlikely on their own. The software switch and hard drive failure might be somewhat uncommon but are independently verified. Multiple analysis scripts appear to be standard lab practice. The proper documentation of excluded participants and prior clean record would be expected from a careful researcher.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these events collectively represent normal research challenges and good practices that would be quite likely to occur.\n\n75"

This practice was common in the lab, making it a good cover for potential manipulation.\n\nThe excluded participants with documented notes predating submission is still plausible with misconduct, as someone planning to manipulate results would likely create proper documentation to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe software switch mid-project and hard drive failure are external events verified by IT and would occur independently of any misconduct. These could even provide convenient cover for data inconsistencies or missing files.\n\nHer prior clean record is not incompatible with misconduct in this specific instance. The pressure from Professor Mills regarding the high-profile experiment and grant review creates a new circumstance that might motivate misconduct even from someone with a previously clean record.\n\nAll of these circumstances would still be reasonably likely even if misconduct occurred in this specific study.\n\n65"
