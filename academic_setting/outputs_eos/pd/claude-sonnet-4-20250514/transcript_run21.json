    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns are quite common in academia - graduate students frequently feel and express this type of stress about important studies. This could easily occur without misconduct.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with additional participants that were later excluded could have innocent explanations - legitimate exclusions based on data quality, protocol violations, or other valid criteria that became apparent during analysis.\n\nHowever, the combination of the other two pieces of evidence is highly problematic:\n\nThe p-value distribution showing an unusual concentration just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across multiple analyses is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or data manipulation. While some clustering below .05 can occur by chance, the described pattern across \"several\" analyses with \"almost no\" values just above .05 is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nThe modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research integrity protocols. Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent post-hoc modifications that could bias results. Legitimate changes would typically be documented transparently with explanations, not silent modifications after seeing the data.\n\nThe combination of these statistical and procedural irregularities, particularly the highly suspicious p-value pattern, would be extremely unlikely to occur innocently.\n\n15"

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did commit academic misconduct:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns would be very likely - these represent exactly the type of motivational factors that drive researchers toward misconduct. The pressure from her supervisor needing results for the grant and her own career concerns about needing a \"successful\" study create strong incentives for manipulation.\n\nThe p-value distribution with unusual concentration just below .05 and almost none just above .05 is a classic signature of p-hacking and data manipulation. If someone is manipulating data or analyses to achieve significance, this is exactly the pattern that would emerge - they would keep adjusting until they got below .05 and stop there.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a common form of misconduct that allows researchers to retroactively justify their analytical choices. This gives them flexibility to exclude inconvenient data points or change hypotheses to match their results.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with additional participants who were later excluded fits perfectly with selective data exclusion - a form of misconduct where researchers remove participants whose data don't support their hypothesis, often testing multiple exclusion strategies until they find one that works.\n\nAll of these elements work together in a coherent pattern: motivation (pressure/career concerns), opportunity (sole control over data processing), and multiple methods of manipulation (selective exclusion, p-hacking, post-hoc preregistration changes). Each piece of evidence would be highly expected if misconduct occurred.\n\n95"

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this being standard practice rather than misconduct.\n\nHaving two participants excluded for falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating journal submission, represents completely standard and appropriate data quality control. These are textbook examples of legitimate exclusions that any careful researcher would make.\n\nA mid-project software switch causing file management issues is a common occurrence in research labs, especially when labs upgrade systems or lose institutional licenses. The confirmed hardware failure with IT department verification provides independent documentation of technical problems that could explain missing files and analysis inconsistencies.\n\nA prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit is strong evidence of Lena's typical research practices and integrity. Researchers rarely suddenly shift from exemplary data management to fabrication without intervening factors.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only consistent with innocent conduct, but are exactly what would be expected from a careful researcher working in a well-managed lab that follows proper protocols. The combination provides multiple mundane explanations for apparent irregularities while demonstrating established patterns of good research practices.\n\n85"

If everyone in the lab routinely runs multiple analyses, Lena's manipulative behavior would blend in and appear normal. This actually makes misconduct easier to hide.\n\nHaving two participants with legitimate exclusions (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with properly documented, predated notes would be expected even if misconduct occurred. Someone committing fraud would likely still exclude obviously problematic participants for legitimate reasons - this doesn't preclude also making illegitimate exclusions of other participants.\n\nThe software switch and confirmed hard drive failure would be extremely convenient for someone committing misconduct, as these provide ready-made explanations for missing files, inconsistent analyses, and gaps in documentation. While these events genuinely occurred, they could easily be exploited to cover tracks.\n\nA prior record of clean, well-documented research that passed audit would actually be quite common among researchers who later commit misconduct. Many cases of research fraud involve previously reputable researchers who turn to manipulation under pressure. The clean record might even make Lena less likely to be suspected initially.\n\nAll of these factors could coexist with misconduct - the legitimate exclusions, lab practices, technical problems, and good track record don't prevent manipulation from occurring alongside them. However, they do provide substantial cover and alternative explanations.\n\n65"
