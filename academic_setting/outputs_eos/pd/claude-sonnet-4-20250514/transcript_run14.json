    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This could happen innocently if Alex was just using the printer normally or checking on a print job.\n\n2. The team chat post about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This was posted at noon, hours before the failure, and received laughing emojis suggesting it was seen as a lighthearted complaint. Such frustration with office equipment is very common.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash can similar to the broken tray - This is more suspicious, but could potentially have other explanations (fragments from an earlier minor incident, fragments that fell and Alex cleaned up without causing the major break, etc.).\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then correcting to possible morning use - This inconsistency in memory about morning use doesn't directly relate to the afternoon failure, and people often have imperfect recall about routine activities.\n\nIf Alex is innocent, we'd need:\n- Coincidental timing of being near the printer before someone else caused the failure or it failed mechanically\n- Coincidental presence of similar plastic fragments from another source\n- Normal workplace frustration being expressed earlier\n- Normal memory uncertainty about routine morning activities\n\nWhile each individual element might be explained away, the combination creates a pattern that would be quite coincidental if Alex were completely innocent. The plastic fragments in particular are difficult to explain innocently, and the timing of being the last person seen at the printer is problematic.\n\nThe probability that all these elements would align by coincidence if Alex were innocent is low.\n\n15"

The noon team chat post about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This would fit perfectly as evidence of mounting frustration that could lead to destructive behavior later in the day.\n\n3.

Initially denying printer use then correcting to possible morning use - This evasive behavior would be very consistent with someone who broke something and is trying to distance themselves from the incident, while the correction to \"morning use\" attempts to explain away any evidence of his presence without admitting to being there during the actual failure.\n\nIf Alex actually broke the printer, all of these pieces of evidence would fit together very naturally:\n- The earlier frustration provides motive\n- Being the last person seen there provides opportunity  \n- The plastic fragments suggest he tried to clean up\n- The initial denial followed by partial admission shows consciousness of guilt\n\nThis evidence pattern would be highly expected if Alex were actually guilty of breaking the printer.\n\n95"
