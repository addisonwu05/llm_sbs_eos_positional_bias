    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This is somewhat suspicious but could happen innocently if Alex was near the printer for legitimate reasons when it coincidentally failed shortly after.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in team chat - This is fairly common workplace frustration that many employees express about malfunctioning equipment. The laughing emoji reactions suggest coworkers saw it as typical venting rather than a serious threat.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash - This is quite incriminating evidence that would be difficult to explain away innocently, though not impossible if the fragments came from something else or were planted.\n\n4. Initial denial followed by correction - This inconsistency in Alex's story is suspicious, though people do sometimes forget mundane activities like printing.\n\nIf Alex were innocent, we'd need:\n- A coincidental timing of being near the printer when it failed from other causes\n- Normal workplace complaints that happened to precede the failure\n- Plastic fragments that either aren't from the printer or got there through other means\n- A memory lapse about printing that was later corrected\n\nWhile each individual element could have an innocent explanation, the combination of all four creates a pattern that would be quite unlikely to occur by mere coincidence if Alex were truly innocent.\n\n25"

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure - If Alex broke it, this timing makes perfect sense and would be very likely to occur.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in team chat - This establishes motive and frustration. If Alex later acted on this frustration by breaking the printer, the prior complaint would be very consistent and likely.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash - If Alex broke the printer and tried to dispose of evidence, finding matching fragments in their personal trash would be highly likely.\n\n4. Initial denial followed by correction - If Alex broke the printer, they would have strong motivation to lie initially to avoid suspicion. The later \"correction\" to admit possible morning use could be an attempt to seem more honest while still concealing the actual incident.\n\nIf Alex were guilty, all four pieces of evidence would flow naturally from the sequence of events: prior frustration, breaking the printer, attempting to dispose of evidence, and then lying when questioned. Each element would be highly probable given guilt.\n\nThe only factors that might lower the probability slightly would be if Alex were more careful about evidence disposal or more consistent in their lies, but people often make mistakes when trying to cover up wrongdoing.\n\n85"

The timing alibi is particularly compelling, and the combination of known mechanical defects, another person's forceful handling, and Alex's proactive maintenance reporting creates a highly coherent innocent narrative.\n\n92"

However, it provides strong alternative explanations that compete with Alex's guilt.\n\n4. Alex's proactive email about grinding noise and reporting pattern - If Alex were planning to break the printer or had already damaged it, sending a preemptive maintenance email could be seen as creating cover.
