    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence independently:\n\n1. **Additional participants excluded from final dataset**: This is quite common in research - participants may be excluded for valid reasons like not meeting inclusion criteria, equipment malfunctions, or incomplete data. This alone is not suspicious.\n\n2. **P-values concentrated just below 0.05**: This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses. The probability of several independent tests all yielding p-values in the narrow range of 0.041-0.049 by chance is astronomically low. This is a strong statistical red flag.\n\n3. **Preregistration modified after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-data collection fundamentally violates research integrity principles. While minor clarifications might be acceptable, changing these core elements after seeing the data is a serious breach.\n\n4. **Emails about pressure and needing results**: While researchers often feel pressure, explicitly stating \"I need this one to work\" suggests a concerning mindset that prioritizes desired outcomes over scientific integrity.\n\nThe combination of these factors - particularly the suspicious p-value distribution and post-hoc preregistration changes - creates a pattern that would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur innocently. The statistical anomalies alone make innocent explanations highly improbable.\n\nEven accounting for potential innocent explanations for individual elements, the convergence of all these suspicious patterns in a single study where there was known pressure for positive results makes the scenario extremely unlikely if no misconduct occurred.\n\n5"
