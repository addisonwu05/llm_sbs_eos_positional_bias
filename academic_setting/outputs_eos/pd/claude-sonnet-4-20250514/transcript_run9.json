    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - If innocent, this could be coincidental timing, but it's somewhat unlikely given the narrow window.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in team chat - This could be innocent frustration, but the timing and phrasing create an unfortunate appearance.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's trash - This is the most damning evidence. If Alex didn't break the printer, how would matching fragments end up specifically in his trash can? This would require either an extraordinary coincidence or someone deliberately planting evidence.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing the story - Memory lapses happen, but this inconsistency undermines credibility at a crucial time.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence might have an innocent explanation, the combination is quite damaging. The plastic fragments in particular are very difficult to explain away if Alex is truly innocent - the probability of fragments from a printer breakdown ending up specifically in an innocent person's trash can is extremely low.\n\nEven accounting for possible alternative explanations (mechanical failure, someone else's actions, planted evidence), the constellation of evidence strongly points toward Alex's involvement.\n\n15"

The \"lose it\" comment in team chat earlier - This fits perfectly as it shows mounting frustration that could lead to the destructive act.\n\n3.

The eyewitness timing, the prior expressed frustration, the physical evidence in his possession, and the suspicious changes in his account all fit together coherently if he's guilty.\n\nThe only aspects that reduce the probability slightly are that some of the evidence (like the fragments in the trash) shows somewhat poor cover-up attempts, but people often don't think clearly when trying to hide wrongdoing.\n\n85"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.
