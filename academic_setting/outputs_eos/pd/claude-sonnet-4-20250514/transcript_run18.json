    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This could happen innocently if Alex was just checking on a print job or walking by, but the timing is quite suspicious.\n\n2. The threatening message in team chat - While probably meant as venting/humor (given the laughing emojis), this creates a clear motive and intent that's documented.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray - This is very difficult to explain innocently. If Alex didn't break the printer, how would pieces of the broken tray end up specifically in their trash can?\n\n4. Initial denial then correction about printer usage - This suggests consciousness of guilt or at minimum shows Alex wasn't being truthful initially about their interaction with the printer.\n\nIf Alex were innocent, we'd need to believe:\n- Someone else broke the printer despite Alex being the last person seen there\n- Plastic fragments from the printer coincidentally ended up in Alex's specific trash can\n- Alex's threatening message was just unfortunate timing\n- Alex's initial denial was an innocent mistake\n\nThe combination of the physical evidence (plastic fragments in Alex's trash), the proximity evidence (being seen there right before failure), and the behavioral evidence (threatening message + initial denial) creates a very strong circumstantial case. While each piece individually might have an innocent explanation, having all of them occur together if Alex were innocent would be quite unlikely.\n\n15"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error - This creates a significant problem if Alex broke it. Either the access logs are wrong, the printer's error log is wrong, or Alex didn't directly cause the failure that triggered the error message. It's possible Alex damaged it earlier and it finally failed after he left, but this timing makes direct causation much less likely.\n\n2. Jamie's forceful handling on camera - This could still occur even if Alex later broke it, as multiple people could have damaged it progressively. However, this provides an alternative explanation that doesn't require Alex's involvement.\n\n3. Documented history of mechanical failures in the same model - This evidence would exist regardless of whether Alex broke this particular unit, so it's neutral in terms of likelihood.\n\n4. Alex's previous responsible reporting and email about grinding noise - This would be somewhat unlikely if Alex was planning to break the printer, as it establishes him as someone who tries to prevent equipment problems rather than cause them.\n\nThe most problematic piece is the timing - if Alex broke the printer, having him badge out 7 minutes before the recorded failure creates a significant inconsistency that would require additional explanations (delayed failure, incorrect timestamps, etc.).\n\n25"
