    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex being seen next to the printer just 5 minutes before failure with no one else around - this could happen innocently if Alex was just using it normally or checking on it, but the timing is quite suspicious.\n\n2. Alex posting about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - this could be normal frustration, but creates a concerning context given what followed.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's personal trash - this is highly suspicious. If Alex didn't break it, how did matching fragments end up specifically in their trash can? This would require either:\n   - Someone else broke it and deliberately planted evidence in Alex's trash\n   - Alex found fragments elsewhere and disposed of them (but why?)\n   - Pure coincidence that similar-looking fragments were already there\n\n4. Alex initially denying printer use then changing their story - innocent people can misremember, but this inconsistency combined with everything else is concerning.\n\nWhile each piece individually might have innocent explanations, the combination creates a pattern that would be quite unlikely if Alex were completely innocent. The plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash can are particularly damning evidence that's very difficult to explain away innocently.\n\nThe probability that all these elements would align by coincidence if Alex was innocent is quite low.\n\n15"

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else around - this would be very likely if Alex broke it, as he would need to be there to cause the damage.\n\n2. Earlier posting about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - this establishes both motive and frustration that could lead to destructive behavior. Very consistent with someone who might act out.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray in Alex's personal trash - if Alex broke the printer and pieces fell off or he grabbed loose fragments to hide evidence, disposing of them in his own trash makes sense. People often make poor decisions about evidence disposal when acting impulsively.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing story - classic behavior of someone who broke something and is trying to distance themselves from the scene, but then realizes others might have seen them and adjusts their story to something less disprovable.\n\nEach piece of evidence fits very well with the scenario where Alex broke the printer. The timeline, the prior expressed frustration, the physical evidence ending up in his possession, and the suspicious change in his account all align naturally with guilt.\n\nThe only elements that might not be certain are minor details like exactly how the fragments ended up in his trash, but the overall pattern strongly supports this scenario.\n\n85"

Alex's pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems - This reinforces that Alex typically acts responsibly regarding office equipment rather than destructively.\n\nAll of these facts align very well with Alex's innocence. The timeline alone (badging out before the failure) is nearly conclusive, and the other evidence provides multiple plausible alternative explanations for the printer failure while painting Alex as someone who acts responsibly regarding equipment issues.\n\n92"

Alex previously reporting grinding noise and requesting maintenance - This is actually quite inconsistent with someone planning to break equipment. Why report problems and request fixes if you're going to destroy it anyway?\n\n5. Pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems - This contradicts the behavioral profile of someone who would destructively break office equipment.\n\nThe timeline issue is particularly problematic - it's very difficult for Alex to have broken the printer if he wasn't there when the critical error occurred.
