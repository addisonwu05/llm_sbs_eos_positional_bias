    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This is quite damaging for an innocent Alex, as it suggests he was the last person to interact with it.\n\n2. The team chat message about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This could be innocent venting that many employees do, but creates a concerning context.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in his trash can matching the broken tray - This is highly suspicious evidence that would be very difficult to explain innocently.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use, then changing the story - This suggests consciousness of guilt or at minimum knowledge that something happened.\n\nThe combination of all four pieces of evidence together is particularly telling. While each individual item might have an innocent explanation, having all of them occur together if Alex was truly innocent would require an extraordinary series of coincidences:\n\n- The printer would have had to break from mechanical failure or someone else's earlier actions\n- Alex would have had to be innocently near it at the crucial time\n- Matching plastic fragments would have had to end up in his specific trash can through some other means  \n- He would have had to forget/lie about his printer usage for unrelated reasons\n\nThe probability of all these elements aligning by chance while Alex remained completely innocent is very low.\n\n15"

Each element follows logically from guilty behavior - being present at the scene, having expressed motive, disposing of physical evidence, and showing deceptive behavior when questioned.\n\nThe combination of all these factors occurring together if Alex was guilty would be very natural and expected.\n\n92"

Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error - This provides a clear alibi showing Alex was not present when the printer actually failed, which strongly supports his innocence.\n\n2. Security footage shows Jamie pulling forcefully on jammed paper - This identifies another person who used significant force on the printer, providing an alternative explanation for the damage.\n\n3. The printer model has documented fuser unit issues and has failed similarly in two other departments without improper handling - This establishes that mechanical failure is a known and recurring problem with this specific model.\n\n4. Alex previously emailed about grinding noises and has a pattern of reporting equipment problems promptly - This shows responsible behavior and suggests someone who tries to prevent equipment damage rather than cause it.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are highly consistent with Alex's innocence. The alibi from the badge logs is particularly strong objective evidence. The documented mechanical issues provide a plausible alternative cause. Jamie's forceful handling offers another potential explanation. And Alex's proactive reporting pattern suggests responsible rather than destructive behavior.\n\nThese elements naturally align and mutually reinforce each other in supporting an innocent explanation.\n\n88"

Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error was logged - This creates a significant problem for the theory that Alex broke it. If he physically damaged the printer, the failure would most likely occur immediately or very shortly after the damaging action, not 7 minutes later when he's already left the building.\n\n2. Security footage shows Jamie pulling forcefully on jammed paper - If Alex broke the printer, Jamie's earlier rough handling would be irrelevant coincidence, which is certainly possible but doesn't support Alex being the culprit.\n\n3. Documented history of this printer model failing similarly - Again, if Alex broke it, the mechanical defect history would just be coincidental background information that doesn't relate to his actions.\n\n4. Alex's previous responsible reporting and proactive email about grinding noises - This evidence actually contradicts the idea that Alex would destructively break equipment, as it shows a pattern of trying to prevent problems rather than cause them.\n\nThe timing issue is particularly problematic - mechanical failures from physical damage typically manifest immediately, not several minutes later. The combination of Alex's absence during the actual failure time plus his established pattern of responsible equipment reporting makes this evidence configuration quite unlikely if he was actually the one who broke the printer.\n\n25"

Alex's established pattern of responsible equipment reporting contradicts the theory that he would destructively damage office equipment.\n\nThe combination of the timing alibi, alternative suspects (Jamie's rough handling), known mechanical defects in this printer model, and Alex's responsible track record creates reasonable doubt about his culpability.\n\n25"
