    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This is somewhat suspicious timing, but innocent people do use printers near when they break.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in chat - This was posted at noon about a jam, which is fairly common workplace frustration. The laughing emoji reactions suggest coworkers saw it as typical venting, not a serious threat.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash similar to the broken tray - This is the most concerning evidence, as it's hard to explain innocently why pieces matching the broken printer would end up specifically in Alex's trash.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing the story - While suspicious, people often misremember routine activities like printing, especially when asked unexpectedly.\n\nThe combination of all four elements together creates a pattern that would be quite unlikely to occur purely by coincidence if Alex was completely innocent. The plastic fragments in particular are difficult to explain away innocently - random printer debris wouldn't typically end up in one specific person's trash can.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence could have innocent explanations, the convergence of the suspicious timing, the complaint, the physical evidence in Alex's possession, and the inconsistent statements creates a scenario that would be improbable if Alex had no involvement in the printer's failure.\n\n15"

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before it stopped working - If Alex broke it, this timing makes perfect sense and would be very likely.\n\n2. The noon chat complaint about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This would establish a clear motive and frustrated mindset that could lead to damaging the printer later. Very consistent with someone who eventually acted on their frustration.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray - If Alex broke the printer and pieces flew off or came loose, it would be natural for some fragments to end up on their clothing or in their immediate area, later discarded in their trash. This would be quite likely.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing the story - If Alex broke the printer, lying about using it would be a natural defensive response when first questioned, followed by a partial admission when realizing the denial might not be believable. This behavior pattern is very consistent with someone trying to cover up their actions.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align very well with a scenario where Alex damaged the printer. The timing, motive, physical evidence, and deceptive responses all fit together coherently. Each element would be quite probable if Alex was indeed responsible for breaking the printer.\n\n85"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.

Alex badging out 7 minutes before the critical error - If Alex didn't break it, this timing would be completely normal and expected. People leave work at various times, and mechanical failures can occur after someone has left. This would be very likely.\n\n2. Security footage showing Jamie forcefully pulling on jammed paper - If Alex didn't break it, it would be quite likely that the actual cause was someone else's rough handling. Jamie's forceful actions could easily have damaged internal components that failed minutes later. This fits well with Alex's innocence.\n\n3. Printer model having documented history of similar failures - If Alex didn't break it, this known defect pattern would be a very likely explanation for the failure. The fact that identical failures occurred in other departments without improper handling strongly suggests a manufacturing/design issue.\n\n4. Alex's prior email about grinding noise and history of responsible reporting - If Alex is innocent, this proactive maintenance request and consistent pattern of proper equipment reporting would be exactly what you'd expect from someone who takes care of office equipment rather than damaging it.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence strongly support Alex's innocence and provide alternative explanations for the printer failure. The timing evidence clears Alex, the footage shows another person's rough handling, the mechanical history suggests inherent defects, and Alex's responsible reporting pattern contradicts the idea of destructive behavior.\n\n92"
