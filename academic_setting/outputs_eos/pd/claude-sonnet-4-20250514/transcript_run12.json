    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if no misconduct occurred:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns are quite common in academic settings - graduate students frequently feel and express anxiety about their research outcomes and career prospects. This could easily occur without misconduct.\n\nExcluding participants from an earlier analysis script has legitimate explanations - quality control, protocol violations, technical issues, or refined inclusion criteria are standard parts of research. The mention of software changes and hard drive failures provides plausible context.\n\nHowever, two pieces of evidence are particularly problematic if no misconduct occurred:\n\n1) The concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above 0.05 across multiple analyses is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally. In honest research, p-values should be roughly uniformly distributed around significance thresholds.\n\n2) Modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly violates research integrity principles. While minor administrative updates might be defensible, changing substantive methodological elements post-hoc is a serious red flag.\n\nThe combination of these statistical anomalies with the preregistration modifications, even in the context of acknowledged pressure and standard research practices like participant exclusion, creates a pattern that would be highly improbable without some form of intentional manipulation.\n\n15"

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if misconduct did occur:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns would be very likely - these represent the exact motivations that typically drive academic misconduct. When someone is engaging in data manipulation, it's usually because they feel desperate pressure for positive results.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with very few above 0.05 is a classic signature of p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern would be highly expected if someone was selectively analyzing data, excluding participants, or manipulating variables until they achieved statistical significance.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a textbook example of academic misconduct - it allows researchers to retroactively justify their analytical choices and present exploratory analyses as confirmatory.\n\nHaving participants in an earlier analysis script who were later excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of selective data exclusion to achieve desired results. If someone was manipulating data, they would likely try different combinations of participants until finding a subset that produced significant results.\n\nAll of these elements together form a coherent pattern that would be highly expected in a case of academic misconduct. Each piece of evidence not only fits with misconduct but represents exactly the types of behaviors and outcomes typically seen in data manipulation cases.\n\n92"

IT department confirmation makes this highly credible.\n\nMultiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria would be very expected in legitimate research, especially during a lab-wide robustness exploration. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this as normal practice rather than suspicious behavior.\n\nLena's clean prior record, including passing an independent audit with well-documented and reproducible data, suggests a researcher who follows proper protocols.

The software switch explains file inconsistencies, the lab culture explains multiple analysis scripts, the hardware failure explains missing files, and the documented participant issues explain legitimate exclusions.\n\nWhile the concentration of p-values just below 0.05 and preregistration modifications remain concerning, the additional context significantly increases the plausibility of innocent explanations for the overall pattern of evidence.\n\n75"

However, the fact that this mirrors lab-wide practices makes it less distinctively suspicious.\n\nHaving a clean prior record with well-documented data that passed an independent audit would be moderately likely even if misconduct occurred on this particular study. Many cases of academic misconduct involve researchers with previously good records who succumb to pressure on a specific high-stakes project.\n\nExcluding two participants with legitimate, pre-documented reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) would be quite likely even with misconduct, as these represent genuine quality control issues that any researcher would address.\n\nHowever, the combination of ALL these factors occurring together - the external technical issues providing cover, the lab culture providing plausible explanations for multiple scripts, the established track record of integrity, and the documented legitimate exclusions - would be less likely in a misconduct scenario. These factors collectively provide too many convenient explanations and reduce the typical \"smoking gun\" evidence pattern.\n\n35"
