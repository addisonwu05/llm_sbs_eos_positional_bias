    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex standing next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching: If Alex is innocent, this could still happen if he was doing legitimate work near the printer area, checking on a print job, or the printer failed shortly after normal use due to mechanical issues.\n\n2. The frustrated chat message about \"losing it\": This is fairly common workplace venting about malfunctioning equipment. Many people express similar frustrations without actually damaging equipment.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray: This is more problematic for innocence. If Alex didn't break it, how did matching fragments end up in his personal trash? Possible innocent explanations could include: fragments from an earlier minor incident, fragments that got stuck to his clothing/papers, or coincidental similar plastic waste.\n\n4. Initial denial then correction about printer use: Memory lapses about routine activities are common, especially when asked unexpectedly. However, the specific pattern of denial followed by partial admission when under suspicion is somewhat concerning.\n\nWhile each piece of evidence individually could have innocent explanations, the combination is quite damaging. The plastic fragments in his personal trash can is particularly difficult to explain innocently, and when combined with his proximity to the printer at the critical time and his defensive/inconsistent statements, the overall pattern suggests involvement.\n\nEven if Alex is innocent, having all four of these elements align by coincidence would be relatively unlikely.\n\n25"

The timing and content would make complete sense if he later acted on this frustration.\n\n3.

Finding matching fragments in his personal trash would be highly expected behavior - attempting to hide the broken pieces he caused.\n\n4.

The initial denial followed by a partial admission when pressed is classic guilty behavior.\n\nIf Alex actually did break the printer, all four pieces of evidence would be highly likely to occur. Someone who damaged equipment would predictably: be near it when it broke, have expressed prior frustration, try to dispose of evidence in their personal trash, and give evasive/defensive answers when questioned.\n\nThis combination of evidence would be almost inevitable if Alex was actually responsible for the damage.\n\n95"
