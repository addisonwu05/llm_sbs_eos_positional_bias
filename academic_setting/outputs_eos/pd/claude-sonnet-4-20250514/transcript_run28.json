    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Even with some flexibility in analysis choices, getting multiple p-values in the narrow band of 0.041-0.049 while having almost none just above 0.05 suggests selective reporting or data manipulation rather than genuine effects.\n\n**Modified preregistration after data collection**: While innocent explanations exist (clerical errors, legitimate clarifications), changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data represents a serious deviation from proper research practices that undermines the validity of statistical inferences, even if unintentional.\n\n**Earlier script with additional participants later excluded**: This could have innocent explanations (data quality issues discovered later, legitimate exclusions), but combined with the modified preregistration, it suggests post-hoc decisions that could bias results.\n\n**Pressure-indicating emails**: While these show concerning pressure and motivation, expressing career concerns and acknowledging supervisor expectations, while unprofessional, doesn't directly indicate misconduct occurred.\n\nThe most damning evidence is the p-value clustering pattern, which is extremely difficult to explain through honest mistakes or standard research practices. The combination of this statistical anomaly with post-hoc changes to preregistration and participant exclusions creates a pattern that would be highly improbable if no misconduct occurred.\n\n15"

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence under the assumption that Lena did commit academic misconduct:\n\n**P-values clustering just below 0.05**: This pattern is a classic hallmark of data manipulation or selective reporting. When researchers fabricate or manipulate data to achieve significance, they typically aim for values that are \"safely\" below 0.05 but don't make results appear suspiciously strong. This clustering pattern would be very likely if misconduct occurred.\n\n**Modified preregistration after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a common form of academic misconduct known as \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known). If someone were manipulating their study, modifying the preregistration to match favorable results would be an expected behavior.\n\n**Earlier script with excluded participants**: If Lena were manipulating data, she would likely experiment with different participant combinations to find the most favorable results. Having earlier versions with different participants that were later strategically excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of data manipulation.\n\n**Pressure-indicating emails**: These emails establish clear motive for misconduct - career pressure, supervisor expectations, and personal investment in positive results. While pressure alone doesn't prove misconduct, it provides the psychological context that makes misconduct more likely and helps explain why someone might cross ethical lines.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only consistent with academic misconduct but are actually typical patterns observed in documented cases of research fraud. The combination creates a coherent narrative of someone under pressure systematically manipulating their study to achieve desired results.\n\n92"

Academic labs routinely run sensitivity analyses and test different exclusion criteria to understand how robust their findings are. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this being normal lab practice.\n\n**Two participants excluded for valid reasons with pre-dating notes**: This is entirely consistent with proper research practices. Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is standard and appropriate. The fact that these exclusions were documented in raw data files before journal submission demonstrates proper prospective documentation.\n\n**Software switch and hard drive failure**: Both of these are common, mundane technical issues that frequently occur in research labs. The IT department confirmation of the hardware failure provides independent verification. Software transitions often happen due to licensing, functionality, or lab policy changes.\n\n**Clean prior record with passed audit**: This strongly supports Lena's integrity as a researcher. Someone with a consistent track record of careful, well-documented work who passed an independent audit would be expected to continue following proper practices.\n\nAll of these elements are not only plausible but quite typical in legitimate research environments.

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence under the assumption that Lena did commit academic misconduct:\n\n**Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: If Lena were manipulating data, having multiple scripts could provide cover for her misconduct - she could claim she was just doing robustness checks while actually cherry-picking favorable results. The fact that other students have similar patterns makes this even better cover. This evidence would be moderately likely if misconduct occurred.\n\n**Valid participant exclusions with pre-dating notes**: Someone committing misconduct would likely still exclude genuinely problematic participants (those who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions) since these are clearly legitimate exclusions. Having proper documentation predating submission could be part of maintaining a veneer of proper practices while manipulating other aspects. This would be quite likely even with misconduct.\n\n**Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure**: These technical issues, while providing convenient explanations for missing files and inconsistencies, are genuinely common occurrences. However, someone engaging in misconduct might also benefit from the confusion and missing documentation these issues create. The timing could be coincidental or potentially exploited. This would be moderately likely.\n\n**Clean prior record with passed audit**: This is somewhat problematic for the misconduct hypothesis. However, academic misconduct often escalates under pressure - someone with a previously clean record might cross ethical lines when facing career-threatening stakes. The pressure described in her emails represents a significant change from her earlier work context. Still, this prior clean record makes misconduct somewhat less likely.\n\nThe evidence presents a mixed picture - some elements could provide cover for misconduct while others (especially the clean prior record) work against it.\n\n35"
