    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In legitimate research, p-values should be roughly uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, and this pattern strongly suggests p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nThe modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research protocol. While honest mistakes in documentation can occur, changing key aspects of the study design after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the scientific process.\n\nHaving an earlier analysis script with additional participants who were later excluded could have innocent explanations (quality control, meeting exclusion criteria), but combined with the other evidence, it raises questions about selective data inclusion.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and personal investment (\"needs this one to work\") show motive and mindset, but alone wouldn't constitute misconduct - many researchers face similar pressures and express similar concerns.\n\nHowever, the combination of the statistical anomalies in p-values and the post-hoc changes to preregistration are particularly damaging. These patterns together create a picture that would be extremely unlikely to occur through honest mistakes or standard research practices.\n\nThe probability that all these suspicious elements would co-occur in the absence of intentional misconduct is very low.\n\n15"
