    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

While this could represent poor judgment rather than outright fraud, doing this specifically to improve results suggests intentional manipulation rather than honest error.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were excluded from the final dataset could have innocent explanations (legitimate exclusions for protocol violations, etc.), but combined with the modified preregistration changing exclusion criteria, this suggests the exclusions may have been results-driven.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" establish motive and mindset, but by themselves don't prove misconduct - many researchers face similar pressures and express similar concerns without committing fraud.\n\nHowever, the combination of all these elements together - especially the highly improbable p-value distribution combined with post-hoc changes to the preregistration - creates a pattern that would be extremely unlikely to occur without intentional manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve desired results.\n\n15"

This pattern is a classic red flag for fabrication or falsification.\n\nModifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be a very likely step for someone committing misconduct - it provides post-hoc justification for analytical choices made to improve results and helps cover tracks by making the final analysis appear planned.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of results-driven exclusions. Someone committing misconduct would likely try different combinations of participants to see what produces the best results, then settle on the version that works.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" establish clear motive and demonstrate the mindset that could drive someone to commit misconduct. These communications show she was acutely aware of the stakes and felt pressure to produce positive results.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only consistent with academic misconduct, but represent exactly the types of behaviors and patterns that would be expected if someone was systematically manipulating their research to achieve desired outcomes.

The confirmed hardware failure with IT department records provides legitimate explanation for missing files and could account for various irregularities in the data trail.\n\nTwo participants being excluded for falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission, represents standard and appropriate research practice. These are legitimate exclusion reasons that any careful researcher would document.\n\nMultiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria being run by Lena and other students as part of a lab-wide robustness exploration is entirely consistent with good scientific practice. This shows the lab was systematically exploring analytical decisions rather than Lena uniquely engaging in suspicious behavior.\n\nAll of these factors together paint a picture of a normally functioning research environment with documented technical issues that could easily account for the irregularities noted earlier, combined with a researcher who has a demonstrated history of proper data handling and is working within established lab practices.\n\n85"

Someone committing misconduct could easily hide inappropriate analytical choices within what appears to be standard exploratory practice, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate exploration from p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nWhile these factors provide plausible alternative explanations for suspicious patterns, they could also serve as convenient cover for misconduct.
