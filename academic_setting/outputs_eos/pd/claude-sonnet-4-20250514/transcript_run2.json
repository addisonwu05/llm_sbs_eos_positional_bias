    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

People often use hyperbolic language without meaning it literally.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray**: This is highly suspicious. If Alex didn't break the printer, why would matching plastic fragments be in his personal trash? This would be an extraordinary coincidence.\n\n4. **Initial denial then correction about using printer**: This inconsistency in his account is suspicious. However, people sometimes forget routine activities or get confused about timing, especially when feeling defensive.\n\nThe most damaging piece of evidence is the plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash can that appear to match the broken printer tray. For an innocent person, having these fragments end up in their trash would require an extremely unlikely sequence of events.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence might have an innocent explanation, the combination - especially the physical evidence of matching plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash - makes it very unlikely that all of this would occur if Alex were completely innocent.\n\n15"

He would naturally be seen at the printer right before it failed since he caused the failure.\n\n2. **Alex posted \"going to lose it\" complaint**: This establishes motive and frustration that could lead to aggressive handling or intentional damage. The threatening language becomes much more significant if he actually followed through.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray**: If Alex broke the printer, he would likely want to dispose of evidence, especially small pieces that broke off. Finding matching fragments in his personal trash would be expected behavior for someone trying to cover up damage they caused.\n\n4. **Initial denial then correction about using printer**: If Alex broke the printer, he would have strong motivation to distance himself from it initially. The inconsistent story suggests deception - first trying to deny any connection, then realizing others might have seen him and partially admitting to use while downplaying it.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence align very well with guilty behavior. The timing, the prior expressed frustration, the physical evidence in his possession, and the deceptive responses all form a coherent pattern that would be quite expected if Alex actually did break the printer.\n\n85"

His proactive reporting suggests he was trying to prevent exactly this kind of failure.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are highly consistent with Alex being innocent.

This pattern of similar failures in other departments without user damage makes Alex's guilt less likely.\n\n4. **Alex previously reported grinding noise and has pattern of reporting problems**: If Alex was planning to break the printer or was handling it recklessly, his prior responsible behavior and proactive maintenance reporting would be inconsistent with that pattern of behavior.\n\nThese pieces of evidence create serious contradictions with Alex being guilty.
