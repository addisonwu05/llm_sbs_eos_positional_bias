    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This could easily occur without misconduct.\n\nExcluding participants from an earlier analysis script can have legitimate reasons - quality control, meeting inclusion criteria, or removing outliers discovered during analysis. However, the timing and context matter.\n\nModifying preregistration after data collection is a serious red flag. While there might be rare legitimate reasons (like discovering the preregistration was unclear), changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-hoc strongly suggests the modifications were data-driven rather than principled.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above is highly suspicious statistically. In legitimate research, p-values should be roughly uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. This pattern is a classic signature of p-hacking or selective reporting and would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance across multiple analyses.\n\nThe combination of all four pieces of evidence together - particularly the statistical pattern of p-values and the post-hoc preregistration changes - would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur innocently. While individual elements might have benign explanations, their convergence points strongly toward intentional manipulation.\n\n15"

Someone engaging in research fraud would almost certainly be feeling this kind of pressure and desperation.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none above is exactly what would be expected from p-hacking, selective analysis, or data manipulation. This is a classic signature of research misconduct aimed at achieving statistical significance.\n\nModifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a common form of misconduct - it allows researchers to retroactively justify their analysis choices and make their approach appear more principled than it actually was.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded fits perfectly with misconduct scenarios - the researcher may have iteratively removed participants until achieving desired results, or refined their exclusion strategy based on how it affected the outcomes.\n\nAll of these elements together represent a coherent pattern that would be highly expected if someone were systematically manipulating their research to achieve publishable results. The pressure provides motive, and the other evidence represents typical methods of research misconduct (p-hacking, post-hoc changes to protocols, selective exclusions).\n\nThis combination would be very likely to occur together in a misconduct scenario.\n\n92"

This would be very consistent with someone who conducts legitimate research.\n\nAll of these elements together paint a coherent picture of normal research practices in a lab environment - routine robustness checks, technical difficulties that are common in research settings, standard quality control procedures, and a track record of good practices.
