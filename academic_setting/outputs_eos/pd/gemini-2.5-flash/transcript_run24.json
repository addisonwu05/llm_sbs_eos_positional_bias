When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

    "content": "To determine the likelihood of the given observations if Alex did not break the printer, we need to evaluate the probability of each piece of evidence occurring under the assumption of Alex's innocence, and then combine these probabilities. \"Alex did not break the printer\" implies the breakdown was due to ordinary use, someone else's actions (Jamie's forceful tug), or an underlying mechanical defect (defective fuser unit).\n\nLet's assess each observation:\n\n1.  **A coworker saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval.**\n    *   If Alex did not break the printer, he could still have been attempting to use it, found it jammed (as he frequently complained), given up, and walked away. The critical error could then have manifested due to an existing defect or prior damage (e.g., Jamie's tug). This is a plausible, though somewhat coincidental, event for an innocent person. Let's estimate its probability as moderate: **40% (0.4)**.\n\n2.  **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again.**\n    *   This reflects Alex's ongoing frustration with a faulty printer, which is stated as frequently jamming. This sentiment is highly likely whether or not he ultimately caused the printer's final breakdown. Let's estimate its probability as high: **80% (0.8)**.\n\n3.  **Small plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes the similarity but did not confirm an exact match.**\n    *   This is the most incriminating piece of evidence. If Alex did not break the printer, explaining these fragments under his desk is difficult.\n        *   If the fragments *are* from the printer: It would mean someone else broke the tray (e.g., Jamie, or a defect), and Alex then collected these pieces and, for some reason, disposed of them under his *own* desk instead of a general waste bin. This is highly unlikely.\n        *   If the fragments are *not* from the printer: It would mean random plastic under his desk coincidentally looks \"similar in color and texture\" to a specific broken printer part. The \"did not confirm an exact match\" leaves this possibility open, but the description of similarity still makes a pure coincidence somewhat unlikely.\n    *   Given the strong implication of similarity and the unusual location (under *his* desk), this event is quite unlikely if he is innocent of causing the break. We must acknowledge the \"not exact match\" detail provides some room for doubt. Let's assign a low probability: **10% (0.1)**.\n\n4.  **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something quickly that morning.**\n    *   If Alex is innocent, this could be due to forgetfulness about a brief morning task, or an anxious, defensive reaction to being informally questioned about a broken piece of shared equipment. Many people might misremember or give a quick, unthinking answer when put on the spot, especially if they are already frustrated with the printer. This is reasonably plausible for an innocent person under suspicion. Let's estimate its probability as moderate: **60% (0.6)**.\n\nTo find the combined likelihood of all these events happening simultaneously, we multiply their individual probabilities (assuming rough independence given Alex's innocence):\n\nP(All Observations | Alex didn't break printer) = P(Obs1) * P(Obs2) * P(Obs3) * P(Obs4)\n= 0.4 * 0.8 * 0.1 * 0.6\n= 0.32 * 0.06\n= 0.0192\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer: 0.0192 * 100 = 1.92% ≈ 2%.\n\n2"

He could have caused the damage (either intentionally or recklessly) just before leaving the office, and the critical hardware error (a system-level diagnostic failure) only manifested a few minutes later due to the damage. This delay provides Alex with a window to exit the building before the full extent of the damage was logged, offering a degree of deniability. This scenario is quite likely. Let's assign a probability of **85%**.\n\n2.  **Security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon.**\n    *   This is a factual event that occurred earlier in the day. If Alex later broke the printer, Jamie's actions still occurred. This observation is entirely consistent with Alex's guilt; in fact, Jamie's forceful tugging could have weakened the printer, making it more susceptible to a final breakdown, whether caused by Alex or not. It's a contributing factor to the printer's fragility. Let's assign a high probability as it's a consistent, pre-existing fact. Let's assign a probability of **90%**.\n\n3.  **The printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments.**\n    *   This is an inherent characteristic of the printer model and a factual background detail. If Alex broke the printer, this fact remains true. It strongly supports the idea that the printer was inherently unreliable and prone to failure. This background could have contributed to Alex's frustration, making him more likely to handle it roughly. This observation is highly consistent with Alex breaking the printer. Let's assign a probability of **95%**.\n\n4.  **Alex had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems.**\n    *   These are factual aspects of Alex's past behavior. If Alex broke the printer, these facts remain true. This shows Alex's prior engagement with the printer's issues and his general diligence. While it might seem to argue against Alex being reckless, it also highlights his prolonged frustration with a faulty machine, potentially leading to a moment of exasperation. This observation is consistent with Alex having a history with the printer that culminated in him breaking it. Let's assign a probability of **90%**.\n\nTo calculate the combined likelihood, we multiply these probabilities:\n0.85 * 0.90 * 0.95 * 0.90 = 0.654075\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer: 0.654075 * 100 = 65.4075% ≈ 65%.\n\n65"

P(E1 | ~A) = 0.02 (2%)\n2.  P(E1 | A) = 0.65 (65%)\n3.  P(E2 | ~A) = 0.58 (58%)\n4.
