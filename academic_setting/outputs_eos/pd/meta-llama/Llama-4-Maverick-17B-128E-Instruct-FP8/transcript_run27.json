    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed circumstances, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring innocently.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that are considered academic misconduct. However, it could also result from genuine analyses where the effects are real and the p-values happen to cluster just below .05. The probability of this happening by chance across several analyses is low but not impossible.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc adjustments to the analysis plan based on the data. Changing the preregistration after data collection to fit the data is a form of academic misconduct. Doing so innocently, such as due to a genuine oversight or misremembering, is possible but less likely if it significantly alters the outcomes.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate either an innocent change in analysis plan or an attempt to manipulate the data. Excluding participants based on legitimate, pre-specified criteria is acceptable, but doing so in a way that significantly impacts the results after seeing the data could be considered misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to achieve certain results**: The emails indicate that Lena felt pressure to achieve significant results, both for her career and her supervisor's grant. While feeling pressure doesn't necessarily imply misconduct, it provides a motive.\n\nConsidering these factors together:\n- The presence of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious but could occur by chance.\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is highly suspicious and unlikely to be innocent.\n- Having different participants in an earlier analysis script could be innocent or not, depending on the reasons.\n- The emails clearly show pressure to achieve significant results, which could motivate misconduct.\n\nGiven these observations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be a remarkable coincidence for all these suspicious patterns to occur together innocently. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the clustering of p-values just below .05 are particularly unlikely to occur together innocently.\n\n5"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the observed circumstances if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's consider each point:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a common indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting, both of which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena manipulated the data or analyses to achieve significant results, it's plausible that she ended up with p-values clustering just below .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Altering the preregistration after seeing the data is a form of academic misconduct that can make non-significant results appear significant. If Lena committed misconduct, changing the preregistration is a likely action.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena was manipulating the data or analyses, excluding certain participants post-hoc to achieve desired results is a plausible action. The fact that an earlier script included participants not in the final dataset could indicate selective exclusion based on the results.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a need for significant results**: The emails show Lena felt pressure and had a motive to achieve significant results. This motive could drive someone to commit academic misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed academic misconduct:\n- The patterns observed (p-values clustering, modification of preregistration, and selective exclusion of participants) are consistent with the actions of someone manipulating data or analyses.\n- The emails provide a clear motive for such actions.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would observe the patterns and emails described.\n\n85"

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she would explore different analyses, but it's also possible she did so legitimately, as other students did.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants with valid reasons and pre-dated notes**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons (e.g., falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes predating the journal submission is a legitimate practice.
