    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given events if Alex did not break the printer, let's examine each piece of evidence and its implications.\n\n1. **Coworker saw Alex standing next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working**: This is plausible even if Alex didn't break the printer. Alex could have been near the printer for a legitimate reason (e.g., checking the status or attempting to print). The fact that no one else approached doesn't directly imply Alex's guilt, as it's possible others were simply not noticed or were out of sight.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer**: Complaining about a malfunctioning printer is a common reaction and doesn't directly imply intent or negligence. Many people express frustration with problematic office equipment.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex's desk**: This could be circumstantial. Even if Alex didn't break the printer, they could have thrown away something else that coincidentally had similar plastic fragments. However, the likelihood of this coincidence depends on how unique the fragments are.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later correcting themselves**: This change in statement could indicate a number of things, not necessarily guilt. Alex might have simply not remembered using the printer or might have been distracted and thus misremembered.\n\nGiven these points, we're asked to consider the likelihood of these events occurring if Alex did not break the printer. \n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, the events described could still occur due to a combination of coincidence, circumstantial evidence, and plausible deniability. \n\n- Alex could have been near the printer without causing it to fail.\n- Complaining about the printer is a normal reaction and not evidence of guilt.\n- The presence of similar plastic fragments could be a coincidence.\n- Alex's change in statement could be due to forgetfulness or not considering a brief print job significant.\n\nPutting it all together, the described events are somewhat unlikely but not extremely improbable if Alex is innocent, as they could be the result of a series of unrelated coincidences or misinterpretations.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given events if Alex did break the printer, let's analyze the evidence.\n\n1. **Coworker saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching**: If Alex broke the printer, being near it around the time it stopped working is highly plausible. It's likely Alex was there when or just before they caused the damage.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again**: This statement could be seen as a precursor to their action if they did break the printer, showing they were frustrated. However, it's also a common reaction to a frustrating situation and not definitive proof.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex's desk**: If Alex broke the printer, it's plausible they might have disposed of evidence (like broken plastic pieces) in their trash, either to conceal their actions or simply as a matter of tidiness.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later correcting themselves**: If Alex broke the printer, their initial denial could be seen as an attempt to distance themselves from the incident. The later correction might be an attempt to seem more cooperative or to correct a lie that was becoming hard to maintain.\n\nIf Alex broke the printer, these events are quite likely because they either directly or circumstantially support the scenario of Alex being involved in the printer's failure. Being near the printer around the time it broke, having previously expressed frustration, potentially disposing of evidence related to the breakage, and attempting to initially deny involvement are all behaviors or circumstances that can be linked to someone who has caused damage, either intentionally or recklessly.\n\n80"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The evidence either directly exonerates Alex (being out of the building when the error occurred), suggests alternative causes (Jamie's handling, the printer model's known issues), or supports Alex's character as a responsible reporter of equipment issues.\n\n90"
