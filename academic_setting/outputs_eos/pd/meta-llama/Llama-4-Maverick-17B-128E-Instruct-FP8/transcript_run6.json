    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider the probability of the evidence occurring under the assumption that she is innocent (i.e., did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data).\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a known issue often associated with p-hacking, a form of academic misconduct where analyses are manipulated to achieve statistically significant results. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be unusual to see such a concentration without any just above .05, as one would expect a more uniform distribution around .05 if the results were genuine and not manipulated.\n\n2. **Preregistration document modified after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and other forms of bias by specifying analysis plans before data is collected. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes suggests that the final analyses were influenced by the observed data, which could indicate misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in analysis plans or data cleaning processes. However, if it is not clearly justified, it could raise questions about selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to achieve certain results**: Lena's emails show she was under pressure and had a personal stake in the study's success. While this doesn't directly prove misconduct, it provides a motive.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be quite unlikely to observe all these pieces of evidence together because they all point towards potential manipulation or at least raise significant suspicions.\n\n- The presence of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious and not what one would typically expect from genuine, unmanipulated data.\n- Modifying the preregistration document post-data collection is against standard practice aimed at preventing exactly this kind of issue.\n- Having an earlier analysis script with different participants not included in the final dataset could be innocent but adds to the overall suspicion when combined with other factors.\n- The emails show a clear motive for wanting the study to succeed, aligning with the suspicious findings.\n\nConsidering these factors together, it seems improbable that all these events would occur without some form of misconduct, given their cumulative suggestiveness.\n\nThe probability is: 5"

Let's analyze the evidence:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena committed misconduct, it is likely she might have engaged in p-hacking or selectively reported results to achieve significant p-values. This behavior is consistent with having many p-values just below .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: A researcher committing misconduct might alter the preregistered plan to fit the data they have, making their results look more significant or meaningful. This action is consistent with misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena was manipulating data or analyses, she might exclude certain participants to achieve desired results, which aligns with having different participants in an earlier analysis script.\n\n4. **Emails showing pressure and motive**: The emails indicate a strong desire for the study to succeed, providing a motive for misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, it is quite likely that:\n- She would manipulate analyses to achieve significant results, resulting in an unusual distribution of p-values.\n- She would alter the preregistration to fit her results.\n- She might exclude certain participants to achieve her desired outcomes.\n- The emails already indicate a motive.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed misconduct, it's quite likely that we would see the observed evidence.\n\nThe probability is: 90"
