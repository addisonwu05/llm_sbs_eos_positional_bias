    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the presented evidence, we need to analyze each piece of information and how it relates to the possibility of misconduct.\n\n1. **Earlier version of the analysis script including additional participants**: The existence of an earlier version of the analysis script with more participants than the final dataset could indicate that Lena initially included more participants but later decided to exclude some based on certain criteria. While this could be seen as suspicious, it could also be a result of legitimate decisions made during the data analysis process, such as excluding participants due to data quality issues or applying exclusion criteria.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a process where researchers detail their hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans before collecting data to enhance transparency and reduce the potential for bias. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly irregular and can be a sign of questionable research practices or misconduct, as it could be used to make the results appear more significant than they actually are.\n\n3. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: Lena's comments about needing the study to work and the potential negative impact of a null result on her career suggest she had a strong motivation to achieve certain results. While this indicates pressure and a personal stake, it does not directly prove misconduct.\n\n4. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: The distribution of p-values just below .05 with a sharp drop-off just above .05 across several analyses is unusual and can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that can inflate the false positive rate and are considered a form of academic misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her to adhere to good research practices, such as sticking to preregistered plans, not selectively reporting results, and not manipulating data.\n\nHowever, the evidence presented (especially points 2 and 4) suggests behaviors that are not consistent with good research practices and are indicative of potential misconduct. The modification of the preregistration document and the suspicious distribution of p-values are particularly telling.\n\nConsidering the above, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be quite coincidental that multiple indicators suggest otherwise. \n\nThe probability that all these events would occur without misconduct is very low.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate or selectively report data to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection can be a sign of questionable research practices. If Lena committed academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration could be a way to align the analysis plan with the data in a way that produces significant results.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants not in the final dataset**: Excluding participants can be legitimate if based on predefined criteria. However, if Lena committed misconduct, she might exclude participants to manipulate the results. The fact that earlier versions of the analysis included more participants who were later excluded could be consistent with this, especially if the exclusion criteria were changed post-hoc.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a motive**: Lena's comments about needing the study to succeed and the potential consequences of failure suggest a motive for misconduct. If she committed academic misconduct, these statements provide context for why she might have done so.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is plausible that:\n- She would manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant p-values.\n- She would modify the preregistration document to justify the changes made to achieve significant results.\n- She might exclude certain participants to achieve the desired outcome.\n- Her emails reflect a motive and pressure that could drive such actions.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the probability that we would observe the described evidence is quite high because the evidence directly aligns with behaviors associated with misconduct.\n\n90"

The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports that this was part of a lab-wide approach, making it plausible under the assumption of no misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants due to issues like falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a valid practice if done based on pre-defined criteria or clear data quality issues. The notes predating the journal submission suggest that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome was known, supporting the legitimacy of this action.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are not uncommon in research settings. These events can lead to complications and file losses, which can be frustrating but are not indicative of misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Having a history of well-documented and reproducible research practices, as evidenced by passing an independent data audit, supports the notion that Lena is capable of conducting research with integrity.\n\nGiven that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the observed evidence is quite plausible:\n- Running multiple analysis scripts is a valid practice, especially if it's a lab-wide approach.\n- Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes is legitimate.\n- Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are common and not indicative of misconduct.\n- A prior record of clean data handling supports the assumption of integrity.\n\nThe probability that we would observe this evidence if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is relatively high.\n\n80"
