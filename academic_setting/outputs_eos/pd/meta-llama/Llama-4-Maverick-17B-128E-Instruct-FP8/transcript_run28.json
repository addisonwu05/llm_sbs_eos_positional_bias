    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider the probability of observing such evidence under the assumption that she acted with integrity and made only honest mistakes or experienced miscommunication.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can occur due to various factors, including p-hacking or QRPs (questionable research practices), but it can also be a result of genuine research practices if the effects are real and the study is well-powered. However, the absence of p-values just above .05 is unusual and could suggest some form of selection bias.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a safeguard against post-hoc hypothesizing and data dredging. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data can be a form of p-hacking. If Lena didn't commit misconduct, this could be an honest mistake or a miscommunication. However, it's a less likely explanation given the potential implications of such actions.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants later excluded**: This could be due to various reasons, including methodological adjustments based on data quality issues discovered post-data collection. If Lena acted with integrity, this could be seen as a reasonable adjustment after identifying issues with some participants' data. However, the rationale behind such exclusions would be crucial.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails indicate that Lena had a motivation to achieve certain results, they do not directly imply misconduct. However, they provide context that could suggest why one might be tempted to engage in QRPs or misconduct if they were inclined to do so.\n\nGiven these observations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we are left to assess whether these occurrences can plausibly result from innocent errors, miscommunication, or legitimate research practices.\n\nWhile each of these events individually could have an innocent explanation, their accumulation raises suspicions. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious but not definitive evidence of misconduct. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is highly questionable and not easily explained by innocent means, as is the exclusion of participants from an earlier analysis script without clear justification.\n\nThe critical issue is whether these can collectively occur without misconduct. The combination of these factors is quite unusual under normal, honest research practices.\n\nThe probability that all these events occur without misconduct is quite low.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it is plausible she would manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a form of academic misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration document to align with favorable outcomes or to justify certain analyses would be consistent with this behavior.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants later excluded**: Excluding participants post-hoc without a clear, valid reason can be a form of data manipulation. If Lena committed misconduct, excluding certain participants to achieve desired results or to \"clean up\" the data would be consistent with this.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails indicate motive rather than the act itself, they provide context that is consistent with the possibility of misconduct under pressure.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would engage in behaviors that result in the observed evidence, such as manipulating data or analyses to achieve significant p-values, altering the preregistration to justify her actions, and selectively excluding participants to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nThe presence of all these factors together is highly consistent with a scenario where Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "Let's analyze the given information to assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n1. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This is consistent with exploratory analyses to check robustness, a common and acceptable practice in research, especially if it's part of a lab-wide effort. It indicates a thorough approach to understanding the data.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on valid reasons (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants for valid reasons such as not following instructions or falling asleep during a task is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports the legitimacy of these exclusions, suggesting they were not done to manipulate the results for publication.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software mid-project and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events beyond Lena's control that could explain some irregularities or missing files. A software switch can cause methodological adjustments, and a hard drive failure can result in lost files, both of which are plausible explanations for some of the observed \"irregularities.\"\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean and well-documented data**: Having a history of conducting research with integrity and having previous projects pass an independent data audit supports the notion that Lena is capable of and has a history of acting with integrity.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's quite plausible that the observed evidence (running multiple analysis scripts, excluding participants for valid reasons, experiencing technical issues like software switch and hard drive failure, and having a clean record) could occur. These actions and events are largely explainable by standard research practices and external circumstances.\n\n70"

They provide a plausible explanation for some discrepancies or lost files.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean and well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible that she had previously acted with integrity or was not caught. A prior clean record does not necessarily preclude misconduct in a specific instance.\n\nThe evidence related to running multiple scripts, excluding participants for valid reasons, and having a prior clean record can be seen as somewhat consistent with or not directly contradicting the possibility of misconduct in this specific case. The lab's practices and external technical issues (software switch and hard drive failure) are independent of Lena's actions regarding misconduct.\n\nThe likelihood that these events occur if Lena committed misconduct is relatively plausible because many of these factors are either unrelated to misconduct directly or can be seen as part of normal research practices or external circumstances.\n\n60"
