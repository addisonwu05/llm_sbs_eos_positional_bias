    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider the probability of the evidence assuming she was innocent (i.e., did not manipulate or fabricate data). The key pieces of evidence include: (1) the high concentration of p-values just below .05, (2) the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, (3) the exclusion of participants in the final dataset that were included in an earlier analysis script, and (4) Lena's emails indicating pressure to achieve a certain result.\n\n1. **High concentration of p-values just below .05**: This could be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which is a form of academic misconduct. However, it could also be due to genuine research practices if the analyses were appropriately planned and the results reflect real effects. The probability of seeing such a pattern by chance, assuming innocence (no p-hacking), is low because it suggests an unnatural distribution of p-values.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) by specifying the analysis plan before seeing the data. Changing the preregistration document after data collection undermines this purpose and could indicate misconduct if done to align with more favorable results. An innocent explanation might involve a genuine need to correct errors or omissions in the initial preregistration, but doing so after data collection is highly irregular.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants in the final dataset**: While excluding participants based on preregistered criteria is legitimate, doing so in a way that wasn't preregistered or that significantly alters the results can be problematic. If the exclusion was not preregistered and significantly impacted the results, it raises suspicions.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: These emails suggest that Lena felt pressure to achieve certain results. While this doesn't directly imply misconduct, combined with other suspicious patterns, it contributes to a context where questionable research practices might be more likely.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect to see a more random distribution of p-values around the significance threshold, adherence to the initial preregistration plan, and less indication of pressure to alter results post-hoc.\n\nThe accumulation of these suspicious patterns (p-values, changes to preregistration, and participant exclusion) makes it unlikely that all occurred innocently, especially in the context of expressed pressure to achieve certain results.\n\n5"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed evidence assuming Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to consider how the evidence aligns with behaviors associated with misconduct, such as data manipulation or fabrication, and questionable research practices.\n\n1. **High concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a common indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena manipulated data or analyses to achieve significant results, we would expect to see a pattern like this.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Modifying the preregistration after seeing the data, especially to align with more favorable outcomes, is a sign of potential misconduct. This action could be taken to justify analyses that yield significant or desired results.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants in the final dataset**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, excluding certain participants post-hoc could be a way to achieve more favorable results, especially if the exclusion criteria were not preregistered or were altered after data collection.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: While not direct evidence of misconduct, these emails suggest a context where misconduct might be more understandable or tempting. However, they don't directly indicate misconduct.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is plausible that she would manipulate analyses or data to achieve significant results (explaining the p-values distribution), alter the preregistration to justify her actions, and exclude participants to enhance the results. Thus, the observed evidence (p-value distribution, changes to preregistration, exclusion of participants) is quite likely if Lena engaged in misconduct.\n\n90"

The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests it was a common practice in the lab.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons that are documented before the analysis or submission (e.g., not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a legitimate research practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports the legitimacy of this exclusion.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and hard drive failure**: Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are not uncommon in research settings. These can lead to complications and loss of files but are beyond the researcher's control.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean data and passing an independent audit**: A history of good research practices supports the notion that Lena is capable of conducting research without misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would explore different analysis scripts as part of robust research practices, similar to her peers.\n- She would exclude participants based on legitimate, pre-documented reasons.\n- The lab would experience technical issues like software changes and hardware failures.\n- She would have a clean record from previous audits, indicating a history of good practice.\n\nThese pieces of evidence are consistent with innocent explanations and common challenges in research.\n\n80"

Let's examine them:\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this could be a sign of robust research, it could also be used to mask p-hacking or to explore how to achieve desired results. However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests it might be a common lab practice rather than an indication of misconduct specific to Lena.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants with legitimate reasons**: Even if Lena committed misconduct elsewhere, excluding participants based on valid, pre-existing reasons doesn't directly indicate misconduct. It's a standard practice.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and hard drive failure**: These are technical issues unrelated to Lena's actions or misconduct. They could happen to any researcher.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data and passing an independent audit**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she hadn't done so in previous studies or that previous misconduct (if any) wasn't detected. A clean record in the past doesn't directly inform about her actions in the current case but suggests that if she did commit misconduct, it might not be a habitual behavior.\n\nThe likelihood of these events under the assumption of misconduct is not necessarily low because many of these factors are unrelated to the misconduct directly (e.g., software switch, hard drive failure) or can be part of legitimate research practices (e.g., running multiple scripts, excluding participants for valid reasons).
