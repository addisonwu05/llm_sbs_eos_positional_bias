    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed events if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. However, it could also result from legitimate analysis practices, though the concentration just below .05 is suspicious. The probability of this occurring by chance, without any misconduct, is low because the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis should be uniform.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. Changing the preregistration document after data collection to fit the results is a red flag for academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's unlikely she would alter the preregistration document in such a manner.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in analysis plans based on initial data inspection or methodological decisions. However, the fact that participants were excluded could be suspicious if not justified properly. There could be legitimate reasons for excluding participants (e.g., not meeting inclusion criteria upon further review), but the change should be justifiable and transparent.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: The emails reveal that Lena felt pressure to produce a certain outcome, both from her supervisor's expectations and her own career prospects. While this indicates motive, it doesn't directly imply misconduct. Many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nConsidering these points:\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious and unlikely under innocence.\n- The alteration of the preregistration document post-data collection is highly suspicious.\n- The change in participants between the initial and final analysis could be legitimate or not, depending on the reasons.\n- The emails show pressure and motive but don't directly indicate misconduct.\n\nCombining these observations, the likelihood that all these events occur without misconduct is very low, especially given the suspicious pattern of p-values and the alteration of the preregistration document. These are strong indicators of potential misconduct.\n\n5"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, let's examine the likelihood of the observed events.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a common outcome of p-hacking or data manipulation, practices that are considered academic misconduct. If Lena manipulated data or analyses to achieve significant results, it's plausible she would end up with p-values clustering just below .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Changing the preregistration after seeing the data is a form of academic misconduct that can make the results appear more significant or confirmatory than they actually are. If Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration document would be a likely step to justify or hide manipulations.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script had participants who were later excluded from the final dataset**: Excluding participants to achieve a desired outcome or to clean up the data in a way that isn't transparent or justified is another form of misconduct. If Lena was manipulating the data or analyses, excluding certain participants could be part of that process.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: These emails show that Lena had a motive to manipulate the results, given the pressure from her supervisor and her own career concerns. The presence of motive doesn't directly imply misconduct but makes it more plausible that she would act on such pressures.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the observed events become more likely:\n- Manipulating data or analyses could result in p-values clustering just below .05.\n- Altering the preregistration document would be a likely action to cover or justify such manipulations.\n- Excluding participants from the initial dataset could be part of manipulating the results.\n- The emails provide context for why Lena might be motivated to commit such misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it's quite likely that we would see the observed patterns and events.\n\n80"

It suggests that Lena was doing exploratory analyses, which is a normal part of research.\n\n2. **Two participants excluded due to falling asleep or not understanding instructions**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons such as not following instructions or falling asleep during the task is a standard practice. The fact that the notes predating the journal submission support this decision indicates that the exclusion was not done to manipulate the results for publication.\n\n3. **Lab switched statistical software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: Both of these events are plausible and outside of Lena's control. They could explain some of the irregularities or missing files without implying misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This history suggests that Lena is capable of handling data properly and that the current issues might not be due to her incompetence or malice.\n\nGiven that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the observed events are quite plausible:\n- Running multiple analysis scripts is a legitimate practice, especially as part of a lab's effort to check robustness.\n- Excluding participants for valid reasons that were documented before the journal submission is standard practice.\n- Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are unfortunate but common occurrences in research.\n- Lena's history of maintaining clean and well-documented data in previous studies supports the notion that she is generally competent and honest in her data handling.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would see these observed patterns and events.\n\n85"

However, the fact that her actions are similar to others in the lab suggests this might not be unusual behavior for someone trying to manipulate results without being detected.\n\n2. **Excluding participants for valid reasons with pre-dating notes**: This action is consistent with honest research practices.
