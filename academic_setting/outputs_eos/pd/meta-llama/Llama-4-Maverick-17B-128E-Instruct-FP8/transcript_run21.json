    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed events if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the given pieces of information step by step.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a common indicator of potential p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not engage in such practices, we would expect a more uniform distribution of p-values around the significance threshold.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent post-hoc adjustments to the analysis plan based on the data. Changing the preregistered exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection suggests that the final analysis plan might have been influenced by the observed data, which could indicate misconduct if done to achieve significant results.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: While this could indicate some form of data manipulation, it could also be due to honest errors or changes in analysis plans that aren't necessarily misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to succeed and personal stakes**: While these emails show that Lena had a motive to achieve significant results, they don't directly imply misconduct. Many researchers face similar pressures without engaging in misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, several of the observed facts (especially the unusual distribution of p-values and the post-data collection changes to the preregistration document) are highly unlikely because they strongly suggest practices that are considered misconduct (p-hacking and altering the analysis plan post-hoc based on the data).\n\nTherefore, considering the combination of these observations, the probability that they all occurred without any academic misconduct is very low.\n\n5"

While motive alone doesn't prove misconduct, in the context of other suspicious behaviors, it supports the notion that Lena had a reason to engage in misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of observing these specific patterns (p-values just below .05, modification of preregistration, exclusion of participants from an earlier analysis script) increases significantly because they are consistent with behaviors associated with misconduct like p-hacking, selective reporting, or altering analysis plans post-hoc.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that we would observe the patterns described.\n\n80"

However, the fact that it's similar to what other students did suggests it might be a lab practice.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on valid reasons with notes predating journal submission**: This action is justifiable and not necessarily indicative of misconduct. It suggests that the exclusion was based on legitimate reasons rather than being done post-hoc to manipulate results.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. They are more related to the lab's operations and hardware issues than to Lena's behavior.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's possible that she had not done so in previous studies. Past behavior doesn't necessarily predict future actions, especially if the pressures or circumstances were different.\n\nConsidering these points, the events described don't directly result from or necessarily indicate misconduct. They could occur regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct. Therefore, the likelihood of these events happening if she did commit misconduct is not necessarily lower or higher than if she hadn't; they are somewhat independent.\n\nThus, the probability is not directly influenced by the assumption of misconduct.\n\n70"
