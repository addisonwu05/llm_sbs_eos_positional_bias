    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed irregularities and her statements, we need to consider each piece of evidence and its implications.\n\nFirstly, the final dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 across several analyses is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting. If Lena did not commit misconduct, we would expect a more uniform distribution of p-values around .05 for exploratory analyses, rather than a clustering just below it.\n\nSecondly, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag. Preregistration is meant to prevent exactly the kind of flexibility that could lead to false positives. If Lena were innocent, it would be coincidental that the changes made after data collection favored significant results.\n\nThirdly, the earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset could be explained by innocent reasons such as changes in inclusion criteria based on preliminary analyses or data cleaning. However, if these changes were made without a clear, justifiable reason related to the quality or relevance of the data, it could suggest data manipulation.\n\nLastly, Lena's emails indicating pressure to produce a significant result and her personal career stakes could suggest a motive for misconduct. However, having a motive does not necessarily imply guilt, as many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nGiven these observations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we are looking at a scenario where:\n1. Multiple analyses coincidentally yielded p-values just below .05 without a genuine effect.\n2. The preregistration was modified post-hoc for innocent reasons.\n3. The analysis script initially included more participants for valid, non-misleading reasons.\n4. She expressed pressure and a desire for the study to succeed, which is not uncommon among researchers under pressure.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially the clustering of p-values and the post-hoc changes to preregistration—under the assumption of innocence, strains credulity. It suggests a low probability of innocence given these specific circumstances.\n\n5"

The final dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is consistent with p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that could be considered misconduct.\n\n2. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a form of research misconduct, as it alters the planned analysis to potentially fit the data in a more favorable way.\n\n3.

Lena's emails indicating that she felt pressure and that she \"needs this one to work\" suggest a motive for misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that:\n- She would engage in practices that result in suspiciously distributed p-values (p-hacking).\n- She would modify the preregistration document to justify the analyses that yielded significant results.\n- She might have initially analyzed a broader dataset and then narrowed it down to achieve the desired outcomes.\n- Her emails would reflect the pressure and motivation that could drive such misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is very likely that we would observe the patterns and behaviors described.\n\n90"

The lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is consistent with exploring the robustness of findings, a common and acceptable practice in research, especially if other students in the lab did the same.\n\n2. Excluding two participants due to falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes predating the journal submission, suggests that the exclusion was based on pre-existing data quality issues rather than post-hoc justification for excluding data to achieve significant results.\n\n3. The lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure are plausible events that can happen in the course of a research project. These could potentially explain some irregularities or missing files.\n\n4. Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data and passing an independent audit supports her credibility and suggests that she is capable of handling data responsibly.\n\nConsidering these points under the assumption that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events and practices are plausible and consistent with legitimate research practices and unfortunate but understandable technical issues.\n\n80"

Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts could be part of either a genuine effort to test the robustness of findings or an attempt to find analyses that yield significant results (p-hacking). If Lena committed misconduct, she might still have run multiple scripts, but the intention behind this action would be questionable.\n\n2. Excluding participants based on valid reasons (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes predating the journal submission does not directly indicate misconduct. However, if Lena committed misconduct, she might still have legitimately excluded these participants, as this action does not directly relate to fabricating or falsifying data.\n\n3. The lab switching software and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure are events that can happen regardless of misconduct. These are more related to the lab's operations and hardware reliability than to Lena's actions.\n\n4. Having a prior record of clean and well-documented data suggests that if Lena did commit misconduct, it might not be a habitual behavior, or she might have become more careless or desperate in her later work.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of observing these specific circumstances (running multiple scripts, valid exclusions, software switch, hardware failure, and a prior clean record) is still relatively plausible because many of these factors are not directly indicative of misconduct or can be explained by other factors.\n\nHowever, individuals who commit misconduct might still follow proper practices in some aspects of their work or in earlier projects. The presence of these factors doesn't necessarily contradict the possibility of misconduct but makes it less directly related to the evidence.\n\n20"
