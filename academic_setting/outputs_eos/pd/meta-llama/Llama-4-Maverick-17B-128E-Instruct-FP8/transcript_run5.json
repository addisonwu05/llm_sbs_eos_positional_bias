    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Alex did not break the printer, we need to analyze each piece of information and its implications.\n\n1. **Alex posted in the team chat about being frustrated with the printer:** This indicates Alex had a motive or at least expressed frustration, but it doesn't directly imply they broke the printer. It could be a coincidence or an expression of frustration that doesn't necessarily lead to destructive action.\n\n2. **Alex was seen standing next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working:** If Alex didn't break the printer, it's plausible they were simply using it or standing near it for another reason. The fact that no one else approached it in that interval doesn't necessarily implicate Alex, as it doesn't rule out the possibility that the printer was already malfunctioning or that the critical failure occurred later.\n\n3. **Alex initially denied using the printer and later corrected themselves:** This inconsistency could suggest Alex was trying to hide something, but it could also be due to forgetfulness or a genuine uncertainty about their actions earlier in the day. If Alex didn't break the printer, the inconsistency might still be due to other factors such as being distracted or not wanting to be bothered with questions about their use of office equipment.\n\n4. **Plastic fragments similar to the broken tray were found in Alex's trash can:** This is potentially the most incriminating circumstantial evidence. If Alex didn't break the printer, one would need to explain how these fragments ended up in their trash. Possible explanations include coincidence (though the similarity in appearance makes this less likely), someone else putting them there to frame Alex, or Alex disposing of something else that broke.\n\nConsidering these points, if Alex did not break the printer, the combination of being seen near the printer, expressing frustration, having inconsistent statements about printer use, and having potentially related debris in their trash is quite coincidental. \n\nThe likelihood of all these events happening if Alex is innocent (did not break the printer) involves assessing how plausible it is for these events to occur independently of Alex's guilt. \n\nWhile each of these events could potentially occur without Alex being guilty (e.g., being near the printer, expressing frustration, having an inconsistent recollection, and having similar-looking plastic fragments in their trash by coincidence or through some other explanation), the combination of all these factors is less likely if Alex is innocent.\n\nGiven the accumulation of circumstantial evidence pointing towards Alex, if they are innocent, it would require a series of unlikely coincidences.\n\nThe final probability judgment, on a scale of 0 to 100, is: 20"

This behavior is plausible if Alex is trying to hide their involvement.\n\nGiven these points, if Alex did break the printer, the scenario described becomes more likely because it aligns with behaviors and circumstances that could be expected from someone who has just caused damage (being near the printer, expressing prior frustration, disposing of evidence, and initially denying involvement).\n\nThe likelihood of these events happening if Alex is guilty is relatively high because they can be directly linked to the actions or state of mind of someone who broke the printer.\n\n80"

The evidence not only fails to directly implicate Alex but also provides alternative explanations for the printer's failure (Jamie's actions and the printer model's known issues). Additionally, Alex's behavior is consistent with that of someone who is not responsible for the breakdown, as evidenced by their prior reporting of equipment issues.\n\nThe combination of these factors strongly supports the scenario that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n85"
