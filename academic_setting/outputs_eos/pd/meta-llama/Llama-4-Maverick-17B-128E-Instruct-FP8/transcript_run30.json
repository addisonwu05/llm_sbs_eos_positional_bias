    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To determine the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the presented evidence, we need to evaluate each piece of information and its implications.\n\n1. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: This action deviates from standard research practices, which typically require preregistration to be done before data collection to avoid post-hoc adjustments that could bias the results. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data can lead to results that appear more significant than they actually are.\n\n2. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could indicate selective data inclusion or exclusion based on the outcomes, which could be a sign of data manipulation.\n\n3. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these statements show that Lena had a motive to achieve certain results, they do not directly indicate misconduct. However, they do provide context that could suggest why she might be inclined to manipulate data.\n\n4. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is often cited as a potential indicator of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where analyses are tweaked or selectively reported to achieve statistical significance.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her research practices to be transparent, consistent, and in line with standard practices. The observed patterns (especially the unusual distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection) are unlikely under the assumption of no misconduct because they suggest potential manipulation or selective reporting.\n\nHowever, some of these observations could have innocent explanations (e.g., software changes or hard drive failures), and the presence of some suspicious patterns doesn't necessarily prove misconduct. Still, the accumulation of these factors makes an innocent explanation less likely.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena did not commit academic misconduct and still exhibited all these behaviors and results is low.\n\nThe final judgment is: 5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she would manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant results, leading to an unusual distribution of p-values.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration details post-data collection can be a sign of attempting to make the study's outcomes appear more significant or in line with the theory being tested. This action is consistent with misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants not in the final dataset**: Excluding participants or data points selectively can be a form of data manipulation. If Lena committed misconduct, she might exclude certain participants to achieve more favorable results.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a motive**: While not direct evidence of misconduct, these emails suggest Lena had a motive to manipulate the study's outcomes.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is likely that:\n- She would manipulate the data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results, which could result in an unusual concentration of p-values just below .05.\n- She might alter the preregistration document to align with the outcomes she achieved through manipulation.\n- She could exclude certain participants or data points to achieve more favorable results, consistent with the difference between the earlier analysis script and the final dataset.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct and the observed evidence would occur is relatively high, as the evidence aligns with behaviors associated with misconduct.\n\nThe final judgment is: 85"

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

This history suggests she is capable of handling data properly.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: The exclusion of two participants due to falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating the journal submission, indicates that the exclusion was based on pre-existing data quality issues rather than post-hoc manipulation for the sake of achieving significant results.\n\n3. **Lab's data management practices and software switch**: The lab's switch from one statistical software to another and the loss of files due to a hard drive failure are plausible explanations for some of the irregularities observed (e.g., discrepancies in file versions). These are common issues in research that do not necessarily imply misconduct.\n\n4. **Running multiple analysis scripts**: The lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria, similar to other students, can be seen as part of a legitimate robustness analysis effort, which is a good research practice.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have a clean record and pass audits.\n- She would exclude participants based on legitimate reasons that predate any potential manipulation.\n- The lab would have legitimate reasons for software changes and experience technical issues like hard drive failures.\n- She, along with other students, would explore robustness by running multiple analyses.\n\nThus, the probability that these conditions would be met if Lena did not commit misconduct is relatively high.\n\nThe final judgment is: 80"

However, this behavior is also consistent with good research practice (exploring robustness), as seen in other students.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on legitimate reasons**: Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is a reasonable practice.

Misconduct can occur even in individuals or labs with otherwise good practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the probability of the observed scenario is not directly affected by the misconduct itself, as many of the observed behaviors and events are either neutral or consistent with good research practices.\n\nHowever, an individual committing misconduct might be more likely to cover their tracks or not document everything meticulously.
