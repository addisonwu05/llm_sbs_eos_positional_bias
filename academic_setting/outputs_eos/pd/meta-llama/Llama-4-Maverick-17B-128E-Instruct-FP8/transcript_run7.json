    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the evidence presented, we need to consider each piece of evidence and its implications.\n\n1. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data can be a sign of questionable research practices or misconduct, as it can be used to manipulate the results to be more significant or to fit a hypothesis. However, it could also be an honest mistake or miscommunication.\n\n2. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants**: The presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants than the final dataset could indicate that participants were excluded post-hoc, potentially to improve the results. However, there could be legitimate reasons for excluding participants (e.g., failure to meet inclusion criteria upon closer inspection), even if the decision was made after initial analysis.\n\n3. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are manipulated or selectively reported to achieve statistical significance. The absence of p-values just above .05 suggests that there might be a bias against reporting non-significant results.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails show that Lena had a motivation to achieve certain results, they do not directly indicate misconduct. Researchers often have a personal stake in their work, and it is common for their career prospects to be influenced by the outcomes of their studies.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her to have followed proper research practices, including not manipulating the preregistration document after data collection, not selectively excluding participants based on the results, and not engaging in p-hacking. The patterns observed (especially the unusual distribution of p-values and the changes to the preregistration and participant inclusion) are less likely under the assumption of no misconduct because they are indicative of practices that could inflate the false positive rate or otherwise bias the results.\n\nGiven these observations, the probability that all these events would occur without misconduct is low. Each of the observed patterns individually could potentially have an innocent explanation, but together they paint a concerning picture.\n\nThe probability is: 5"

Such events are not uncommon in research settings.\n\n2. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria**: This is consistent with a lab-wide effort to explore robustness, a practice that is considered good research practice. It indicates a systematic approach to analyzing data rather than an attempt to selectively report results, although it doesn't rule out the possibility entirely.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a reasonable practice if the decision is based on pre-defined criteria or notes taken before knowing the outcome of the study. The fact that these notes predate the journal submission supports the legitimacy of this exclusion.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean and well-documented data**: A history of adhering to good research practices, as evidenced by passing an independent data audit, suggests that Lena is capable of handling data responsibly.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is plausible that:\n- She would have explored different analysis approaches as part of a lab-wide initiative.\n- She would have excluded participants based on legitimate reasons documented before the study's outcome was known.\n- She would have experienced the technical issues described.\n- She would have a history of good research practices.\n\nAll these factors are consistent with innocent explanations for the observed patterns and suggest that Lena's behavior in this study could be in line with her past practices and the context of the lab.\n\nThe probability is: 85"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might still engage in this practice to appear diligent or to cover her tracks.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on legitimate reasons**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants for valid reasons to avoid raising suspicions.
