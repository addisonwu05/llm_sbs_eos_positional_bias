    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To determine the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to assess how likely it is for the described events to occur without misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting. However, it could also occur by chance or due to other factors like the specific research design. The probability of this happening without misconduct is low because even if not intentional, such a distribution is unusual and often raises suspicions.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc adjustments to the analysis plan based on the data. Modifying it after data collection without a clear, valid reason (like an error in the initial registration or a change in research question) is not standard practice and suggests potential misconduct. The likelihood of this happening innocently is low.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that the data was manipulated or that participants were excluded based on post-hoc criteria not initially defined. While there could be legitimate reasons for excluding participants (e.g., not meeting inclusion criteria upon closer inspection), doing so without a clear, pre-specified rationale can be problematic. The probability that this happened without misconduct depends on the reasons for exclusion.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to achieve a certain outcome**: While these emails suggest that there was pressure on Lena to achieve significant results, they do not directly indicate misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure to publish or to achieve certain outcomes, and expressing this in emails is not in itself misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider how likely it is for all these events to co-occur without misconduct. \n\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking.\n- Modifying the preregistration document post-data collection is not standard and raises red flags.\n- Excluding participants from an initial analysis is not unusual, but doing so without clear rationale can be problematic.\n- The emails reflect pressure and motivation but are not direct evidence of misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors, especially the first two, makes it unlikely that all occurred without some form of misconduct. While each piece of evidence can potentially be explained by innocent factors, together they form a pattern that is unlikely to occur innocently.\n\nGiven the accumulation of suspicious circumstances (p-value distribution, post-hoc changes to preregistration, and participant exclusion without clear rationale), even if each individual event has some probability of occurring innocently, the conjunction of these events is highly improbable without misconduct.\n\n5"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the described events would occur if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's consider each piece of evidence in the context of misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results. This behavior, known as p-hacking, could result in an unusual distribution of p-values. Thus, misconduct could make this observation more likely.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration document after seeing the data is a form of misconduct that allows researchers to retroactively justify their findings. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration to fit the data she obtained (or fabricated) is a likely step.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, excluding certain participants post-hoc without a valid reason could be part of manipulating the data to achieve desired results. Thus, finding an earlier script with more participants who were later excluded is consistent with potential misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and the need for a positive outcome**: While these emails reflect pressure and motivation, they are more about the context and potential motives for misconduct rather than direct evidence of it. However, they suggest that Lena had a strong incentive to manipulate results.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it becomes more plausible that:\n- She would manipulate or selectively report data, resulting in an unusual p-value distribution.\n- She would modify the preregistration document to justify her findings.\n- She might exclude certain participants to achieve desired results, explaining the difference between the earlier and final analysis scripts.\n\nThe combination of these factors is highly consistent with a scenario where Lena engaged in misconduct to achieve significant results, especially given the context provided by her emails.\n\n85"

The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports that this was part of a lab-wide practice. This evidence is consistent with innocent behavior.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants due to falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants based on pre-defined or reasonable criteria (like not following instructions or falling asleep) is standard practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude them was made before the results were known, supporting the legitimacy of this exclusion.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events that can happen in the course of a research project. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure adds credibility to the explanation.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit**: This history supports the notion that Lena is generally diligent and honest in her research practices.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- It's plausible she would explore different analysis scripts as part of a robustness check, consistent with lab practices.\n- Excluding participants for valid reasons before knowing the outcome is standard practice.\n- Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are common in research.\n- Her past record suggests a history of good research practices.\n\nThe described events are entirely consistent with innocent behavior and the normal course of research, which includes exploring different analyses, dealing with technical issues, and excluding participants based on valid reasons.\n\n80"
