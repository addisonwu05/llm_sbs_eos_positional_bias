    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The fact that no one else was seen approaching doesn't necessarily implicate Alex, as it doesn't account for the possibility of someone approaching before or after the observed interval.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to \"lose it\" if it jammed again.** This statement, while suggestive, is not conclusive evidence of Alex's actions. People often express frustration without acting on it. The reaction of coworkers with laughing emojis suggests they took Alex's comment lightly.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.** If Alex didn't break the printer, the presence of similar plastic fragments could be coincidental or have an alternative explanation. However, it is suspicious and suggests a possible link between Alex and the broken printer.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later correcting themselves.** Alex's initial denial followed by a correction could indicate dishonesty or an attempt to distance themselves from the incident. However, it could also be a genuine memory lapse or an attempt to avoid being drawn into the issue.\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, the probability of all these events happening together involves considering alternative explanations for each event and how likely they are to co-occur.\n\n- The sighting near the printer could be genuine and unrelated to the breakdown.\n- The complaint about the printer is a known fact before the breakdown.\n- The presence of plastic fragments under Alex's desk is suspicious but could be coincidental or have an alternative explanation.\n- Alex's change in statement about using the printer could be due to various reasons not directly related to guilt.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it's possible for these events to occur even if Alex didn't break the printer, the combination of events (especially the presence of plastic fragments similar to the printer's tray under Alex's desk and Alex's initial denial of using the printer) is quite improbable without Alex being involved in the printer's breakdown.\n\nHowever, evaluating the exact probability requires assessing how likely it is for all these specific events to co-occur by chance or alternative explanations.\n\nThe events, while suspicious, are not entirely impossible to occur if Alex is innocent (e.g., being near the printer, complaining about it, having similar plastic fragments in their trash by coincidence, and making a genuine or misleading correction about printer usage). \n\nGiven the information and the need for a probability judgment:\n\n20"

This aligns with the hypothesis that Alex's actions led to the printer's failure.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to \"lose it\" if it jammed again.** This statement can be seen as a precursor to their action if they did indeed break the printer. It shows frustration and a potential motive.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.** If Alex broke the printer, it's likely they might have discarded evidence (like plastic fragments from the broken tray) in their trash, making this a plausible outcome.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning.** If Alex broke the printer and was trying to avoid responsibility, their initial denial followed by a hesitant admission could be a sign of attempting to conceal their involvement.\n\nConsidering these points under the assumption that Alex did break the printer:\n\n- Being seen near the printer around the time it stopped working is consistent with their guilt.\n- The prior complaint about the printer and threat to \"lose it\" could be related to their subsequent action.\n- The presence of incriminating evidence (plastic fragments) in their trash suggests they might have tried to dispose of evidence.\n- The change in their story about using the printer could indicate an attempt to hide their involvement.\n\nIf Alex did break the printer, the events described are quite likely to have occurred because they are either directly related to the act (being near the printer) or indicative of a cover-up (denying or downplaying involvement, disposing of evidence).\n\n80"

This timing is consistent with Alex's involvement in the breakdown, as it indicates they were not present to witness the failure.\n\n2. **Security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.** This information doesn't directly relate to Alex's actions but could be seen as an alternative explanation or a contributing factor.

However, it provides an alternative explanation.\n\n4. **Alex had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems.** This history is somewhat counterintuitive if Alex broke the printer, as it suggests responsible behavior. However, it's not directly related to the likelihood of them breaking the printer.\n\nGiven these considerations, the fact that Alex badged out before the failure is somewhat consistent with the hypothesis that Alex broke the printer, as it suggests they weren't present to be blamed or associated with the failure afterward. However, the other points either provide alternative explanations or are unrelated to the direct causation.\n\nThe events described can still occur if Alex broke the printer, but some (like the printer model's known issues and Alex's responsible reporting history) don't directly support or refute Alex's involvement.\n\nConsidering the information, the likelihood of these events if Alex broke the printer is plausible due to the timing of their departure and the presence of other factors that either don't directly relate to or provide alternative explanations for the printer's failure.\n\n70"
