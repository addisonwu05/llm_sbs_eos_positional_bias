    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed circumstances, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring innocently.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. However, it could also occur by chance or due to other factors not related to misconduct. The probability of this happening innocently is low because it suggests some form of manipulation.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent exactly this kind of issue, ensuring that analyses are planned before data is seen. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection can indicate an attempt to make the results look more significant than they are. This action is suspicious and not in line with best practices for research integrity.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could be due to various reasons, including honest mistakes or methodological changes based on learning or new information. However, it also raises questions about why certain participants were excluded, potentially indicating selective exclusion to improve results.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails show that Lena had a motivation to produce certain results, they do not directly indicate misconduct. Many researchers feel pressure to publish or have their results align with certain expectations without committing misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect the observed patterns (especially the concentration of p-values just below .05 and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection) to be less likely. The combination of these factors—particularly the suspicious statistical pattern and the alteration of the preregistration document after data collection—makes it improbable that all these events occurred without any misconduct.\n\nGiven the information, the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct and that these patterns occurred innocently is very low.\n\n5"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed events if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a common indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation, both of which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she would manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant results, leading to this pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Altering the preregistration document post-data collection is a red flag for misconduct, as it can be used to retroactively justify significant findings. If Lena committed misconduct, changing the preregistration document would be a way to cover her tracks or make her results appear more robust.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, she might exclude certain participants to improve the results, which could explain why some participants were not included in the final dataset.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails show motive, they do not directly prove misconduct. However, they provide context that, combined with other evidence, could suggest a reason why misconduct might occur.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would manipulate the data or analyses to get significant results, explaining the concentration of p-values just below .05.\n- She would modify the preregistration document to align with the manipulated results or to cover her actions.\n- She might exclude certain participants to achieve desired outcomes, which could be reflected in the difference between the earlier analysis script and the final dataset.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood of observing these specific patterns if Lena committed academic misconduct is quite high, as they align with common indicators and methods of misconduct.\n\n80"

This practice is considered good research practice and aligns with a scenario where Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants**: The exclusion based on pre-existing notes in the raw data files that predated the journal submission provides a valid reason for excluding these participants, supporting the notion that the exclusions were not done to manipulate the results.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and hard drive failure**: The switch in software and the loss of files due to a confirmed hard drive failure are external factors that could explain discrepancies and missing files without implying misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data and passing an independent audit**: Lena's history of well-documented and reproducible data in previous projects that passed an audit strongly supports her integrity and suggests that she is capable of handling data properly.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have run multiple analysis scripts as part of exploring the robustness of her findings.\n- She would have excluded participants based on valid reasons that were documented before any potential pressure to manipulate results.\n- The lab's software switch and her laptop's hard drive failure could have caused some of the observed discrepancies.\n- Her past behavior and record would be clean and audited successfully.\n\nThese observations are consistent with a scenario where Lena acted with integrity.\n\n85"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might still engage in this practice, but the fact that it's similar to what other students did suggests it might be a lab culture or practice rather than misconduct.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on valid reasons**: This action is legitimate and not necessarily indicative of misconduct. The fact that notes predated the journal submission supports the legitimacy of the exclusions.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and hard drive failure**: These are external factors unrelated to Lena's actions or integrity.

Individuals can behave with integrity most of the time but fail to do so in a particular instance.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of these specific observations (running multiple scripts like others, legitimate exclusions, lab software switch, hard drive failure, and a prior clean record) is still relatively plausible because many of these factors are either unrelated to misconduct or represent good research practice.\n\nThe fact that she has a prior clean record and that some of the observations can be explained by legitimate practices or external factors means that these observations do not necessarily contradict the hypothesis that she committed misconduct in this instance.\n\n20"
