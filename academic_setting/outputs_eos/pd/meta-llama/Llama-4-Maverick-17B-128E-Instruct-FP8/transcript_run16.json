    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider how plausible it is for these observations to occur without any intentional manipulation or fabrication.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are adjusted or reported in a way that pushes p-values below the .05 threshold. However, it could also result from genuine analyses where the effects are real and close to the threshold. The absence of p-values just above .05 is suspicious but not conclusive evidence of misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency by specifying the analysis plan before seeing the data. Changing the preregistration after data collection undermines this purpose and can be a sign of attempting to justify analyses that were chosen after seeing the data. While it could be an honest mistake or miscommunication, it raises significant concerns.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in the analysis plan based on unforeseen issues with some participants' data (e.g., poor quality, not meeting inclusion criteria upon closer inspection). However, it also raises questions about the rationale behind excluding these participants and whether this decision was made post-hoc to improve the results.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: These emails suggest that Lena had a motive to produce positive results, which could increase the likelihood of her manipulating the data or analyses. However, having a motive doesn't necessarily imply misconduct; many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nConsidering these points, the combination of evidence is highly suggestive of potential misconduct, especially the pattern of p-values and the post-data collection modification of the preregistration. While each piece of evidence could have an innocent explanation, together they form a concerning picture.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit misconduct given these observations. The presence of several red flags makes it less likely that all observations are due to innocent causes, given their cumulative effect. Nonetheless, it's conceivable (though strained) to imagine scenarios where all these events occurred without misconduct (e.g., a series of unfortunate and unusual coincidences, or a very sloppy but not fraudulent process).\n\nGiven these considerations, a reasonable judgment would lean towards a low probability that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, given the accumulation of suspicious circumstances.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might engage in such practices.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: This action is consistent with manipulating the analysis plan post-hoc to fit the data in a way that supports the desired outcome, a form of misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: Excluding participants post-hoc can be a method to improve the results, potentially indicating data manipulation if done in a way that biases the outcome.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: These emails suggest a motive for misconduct.

The fact that other students show similar patterns supports this being a lab culture or policy rather than an individual attempt to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a legitimate practice if based on pre-defined criteria or notes made before knowing the outcome. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports the legitimacy of this decision.\n\n3. **Lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Technical issues and changes in software are common in research projects. A hard drive failure is an unfortunate but plausible event that could lead to file loss.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data and passing an independent audit**: This suggests that Lena is generally capable of handling data properly and following good research practices.\n\nThese observations collectively paint a picture that is consistent with Lena not committing academic misconduct. The practices described (exploring robustness, legitimate exclusion of participants, dealing with technical issues) are all part of normal and responsible research practices. Lena's history of good data handling further supports the notion that she is capable of conducting research without misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena did not commit misconduct, it is quite plausible that we would observe these practices and events.\n\n85"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple scripts, but the key difference would be in how she uses or reports these analyses.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on legitimate criteria with notes predating journal submission**: This is a legitimate practice.

They could happen regardless of whether she committed misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data handling and passing an independent audit**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, her past behavior doesn't directly predict her current actions. However, it's plausible that someone could have a history of good practices and still commit misconduct in a specific instance, perhaps due to extraordinary pressures or circumstances.\n\nThe events described are not directly indicative of misconduct, and some (like the lab switching software and the hard drive failure) are unrelated to her actions. The presence of multiple analysis scripts could be seen as either good practice or a precursor to p-hacking, depending on how they were used.\n\nHowever, if Lena committed misconduct, it is still plausible that these events and practices could occur. Her prior clean record and the technical issues are independent of her committing misconduct in this specific case. The practice of running multiple scripts could be consistent with misconduct if used to selectively report favorable results, but it is not conclusive evidence.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood is not extremely low, as many of these factors are either neutral or could be consistent with a range of behaviors.\n\n70"
