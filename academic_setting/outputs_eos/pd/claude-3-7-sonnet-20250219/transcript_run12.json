    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to assess how likely these findings would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a statistical red flag that often indicates p-hacking or selective reporting. This pattern is quite unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\nThe modification of the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is very problematic. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data.\n\nExcluding participants who were in earlier analysis versions without clear documentation raises concerns about selective data handling.\n\nLena's emails express significant career pressure and a need for positive results, which establishes a clear motive, though doesn't prove misconduct.\n\nWhile honest mistakes can happen (software changes, hard drive failures), the combination of these factors creates a compelling pattern. The statistical anomalies, altered preregistration, participant exclusions, and expressed pressure for positive results would be extremely unlikely to all occur innocently.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of all these issues occurring together by chance or through honest errors is: 5"
