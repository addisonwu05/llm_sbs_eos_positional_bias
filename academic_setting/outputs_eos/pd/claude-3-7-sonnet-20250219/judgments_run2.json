  "No. While there are some suspicious circumstances (Alex's frustration with the printer, the plastic fragments in their trash, and being seen near the printer), the evidence against Alex breaking the printer is stronger. Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error occurred, there's footage of Jamie roughly handling the printer, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments, and Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment issues (including warning about this printer). The timing of events and physical evidence make it unlikely that Alex was responsible for the damage."
