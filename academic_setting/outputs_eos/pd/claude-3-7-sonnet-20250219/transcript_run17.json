    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to evaluate the probability that all these findings would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nFirst, let's examine each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Modified preregistration after data collection: This is a serious violation of research protocol. While honest mistakes can happen, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a major red flag.\n\n2. Excluded participants in the final dataset: Excluding participants can sometimes be legitimate (e.g., for not meeting criteria), but doing so after analysis begins raises concerns about \"data fishing.\"\n\n3. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05: This pattern is statistically unlikely to occur naturally and is a classic sign of p-hacking or data manipulation. In legitimate research, p-values typically distribute more evenly.\n\n4. Emails expressing career pressure: While feeling pressure is common in academia, explicitly stating she \"needs this one to work\" suggests potential motivation to manipulate results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, we would need to accept multiple coincidences:\n- She accidentally modified preregistration after data collection\n- She legitimately excluded participants that happened to change the results favorably\n- She obtained a statistically unusual distribution of p-values through chance\n- Her emails merely expressed normal academic pressure without reflecting actual behavior\n\nWhile each individual element might have an innocent explanation, the combination of all these factors occurring without misconduct is extremely unlikely.\n\n20"

The combination of statistical irregularities, documentation changes, and expressed motivation forms a highly coherent picture of intentional manipulation.\n\n85"

The lab's practice of running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria would provide cover for p-hacking while appearing legitimate. The documented exclusion of two participants for valid reasons doesn't preclude other undocumented manipulations. Software transitions and hard drive failures, while genuinely occurring, could conveniently explain missing files that might have contained evidence of manipulation. Her previously clean record is consistent with many cases of misconduct where researchers have unblemished histories before their first violation, especially when facing new pressures. These circumstances would create an environment where misconduct could be hidden among legitimate research practices and technical issues. The probability of all these circumstances existing even if misconduct occurred is reasonably high, as they represent typical conditions in academic labs and wouldn't prevent someone from engaging in data manipulation if motivated to do so.\n\n65"
