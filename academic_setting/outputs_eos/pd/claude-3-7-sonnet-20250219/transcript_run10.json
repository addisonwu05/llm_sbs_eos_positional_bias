    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess this situation carefully, I need to consider if there's an innocent explanation for all the pieces of evidence against Alex.\n\nThe coworker's observation of Alex by the printer shortly before it broke could be accurate, but doesn't prove Alex damaged it. Alex might have been trying to fix a jam or simply checking if their document had printed.\n\nAlex's frustrated chat message shows they were annoyed with the printer, but expressing frustration doesn't mean someone acted on it. Many people vent without taking destructive action.\n\nThe plastic fragments in Alex's trash are concerning evidence, but we don't have confirmation they match the printer exactly. They could be from something else with similar appearance.\n\nAlex's inconsistent statements about using the printer are suspicious but could reflect genuine confusion or fear of being blamed rather than guilt.\n\nThe printer has a known history of failures, and another employee (Jamie) was seen roughly handling it earlier.\n\nBuilding access logs show Alex may have left before the printer's final breakdown.\n\nWhile the evidence creates suspicion, there are plausible innocent explanations for each piece. If Alex is innocent, the coincidence of all these factors occurring is unlikely but not impossible.\n\n25"

While not absolute certainty (as there could still be explanations for individual pieces of evidence), this pattern is strongly indicative of Alex's involvement.\n\n85"
