  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena likely committed academic misconduct. The pattern of p-values clustered just below significance thresholds with few just above, modified preregistration after data collection, selective participant exclusion, and expressed career pressure strongly suggest deliberate manipulation. While there are some mitigating factors like the software change, hard drive failure, and her previously clean record, these don't adequately explain the statistical anomalies and changed preregistration. The preponderance of evidence points toward intentional p-hacking and data manipulation rather than honest mistakes.\n\nYes"
