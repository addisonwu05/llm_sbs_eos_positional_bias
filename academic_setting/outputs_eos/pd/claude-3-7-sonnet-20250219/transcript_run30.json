    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these observations are if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic sign of p-hacking - selectively analyzing data until significance is achieved. This pattern is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nModifying preregistration documents after data collection directly undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data. This suggests intentional manipulation of the analytical approach.\n\nThe emails demonstrate clear motivation and pressure to produce significant results, showing Lena was aware her career advancement depended on positive findings.\n\nThe excluded participants in earlier analysis scripts suggest selective reporting of data that supported the desired conclusion.\n\nWhile some explanations like software changes and hard drive failures could explain isolated irregularities, the combination of all these factors creates a consistent pattern that would be extremely unlikely without intentional manipulation.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of all these red flags appearing together would be very low.\n\n5"

While this appears similar to other students' work, someone committing misconduct could hide within normal lab practices.\n\nThe excluded participants with contemporaneous notes are legitimate exclusions that would likely occur regardless of misconduct. This is standard practice even in fraudulent research.\n\nSoftware switches and hard drive failures are common in research settings and would occur independent of misconduct.
