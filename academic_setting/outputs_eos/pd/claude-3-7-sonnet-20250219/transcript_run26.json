    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

However, the timing is suspicious.\n\n2) Alex's chat message about \"losing it\": This shows frustration but doesn't prove malicious intent. Many people express frustration with office equipment without damaging it.\n\n3) Plastic fragments in Alex's trash: This is highly suspicious if they match the broken tray, but without confirmation of an exact match, they could be from something else.\n\n4) Alex's inconsistent statements: This suggests Alex might be being deceptive, though people can genuinely forget or misremember their actions.\n\n5) Badge records show Alex left before the printer failure, which supports his innocence.\n\n6) Jamie was seen tugging forcefully on the printer earlier, providing an alternative explanation.\n\n7) The printer model has a known history of failures.\n\nTaking all this together, while there are several suspicious elements pointing to Alex, there are also plausible innocent explanations. The combination of all these specific circumstances occurring if Alex is innocent is quite unlikely, but not impossible.\n\n15"

If Alex damaged the printer and then left, there would need to be a 7-minute delay between the damage and the error appearing. This is possible (perhaps the damage took time to manifest), but it's not what you'd typically expect.\n\n2) Jamie forcefully pulling paper: If Alex broke the printer, this coincidence creates confusion about who's responsible.
