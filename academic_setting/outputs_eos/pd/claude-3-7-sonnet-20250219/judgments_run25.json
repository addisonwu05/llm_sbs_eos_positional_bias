  "Based on the evidence presented, there are concerning patterns that suggest potential misconduct (modified preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution, selective participant exclusion, and concerning emails), alongside mitigating factors (software change, hard drive failure, documented exclusions, prior clean record, and lab-wide practices). While there are plausible innocent explanations for individual issues, the combination of red flags slightly outweighs the mitigating circumstances.\n\nThe pattern of p-values just below .05 with few just above is particularly difficult to explain innocently, and modifying preregistration after data collection undermines research integrity. Her emails also suggest result-oriented thinking rather than commitment to scientific truth.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is: Yes."
