  "Based on the evidence presented, I cannot make a definitive determination. There are concerning elements like the suspicious p-value distributions, modified preregistration after data collection, and motivation expressed in emails. However, there are also mitigating factors like her clean prior record, documented legitimate participant exclusions, the lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses, and confirmed technical issues.\n\nThe evidence presents a mixed picture that doesn't clearly establish misconduct beyond reasonable doubt, though there are significant red flags. Without further investigation, such as independent reanalysis of the raw data or verification from other lab members, I cannot conclusively state whether misconduct occurred.\n\nSince you've asked for a Yes/No answer despite this uncertainty, my assessment based on the weight of the evidence presented is:\n\nNo"
