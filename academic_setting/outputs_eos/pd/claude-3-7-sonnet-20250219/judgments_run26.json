  "Based on the evidence provided, I cannot make a definitive determination. There are concerning red flags (p-values clustered just below significance thresholds, post-data preregistration changes, participant exclusions) that suggest potential misconduct. However, there are also plausible explanations (lab-wide analysis exploration, documented legitimate exclusions, software changes, hardware failure) and her prior record of good data practices.\n\nThe situation presents evidence pointing in both directions, with neither conclusively proving or disproving misconduct. This is a case where reasonable doubt exists and would require additional investigation to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\nWithout more conclusive evidence, I cannot state with certainty whether Lena committed academic misconduct or not."
