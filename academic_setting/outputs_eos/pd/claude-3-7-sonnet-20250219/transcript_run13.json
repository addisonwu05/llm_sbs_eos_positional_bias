    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to evaluate the likelihood of all these events occurring together if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe pattern of p-values clustering just below .05 with almost none just above is a strong statistical red flag. This pattern is highly unlikely to occur naturally and is consistent with p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nThe modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious violation of research protocols. While honest mistakes in preregistration can happen, changing these specific elements after seeing the data strongly suggests intentional manipulation to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nThe excluded participants from an earlier analysis script is concerning. While participant exclusion can be legitimate, this combined with the modified preregistration suggests strategic removal to achieve significance.\n\nThe emails demonstrate clear motivation for misconduct. While career pressure is common, explicitly stating she \"needs this one to work\" shows Lena understood the stakes and felt pressured to produce positive results.\n\nIf Lena were innocent, we would need to accept multiple low-probability events occurring simultaneously: an extremely unusual p-value distribution happened naturally, legitimate reasons existed for changing the preregistration after data collection, participant exclusions were scientifically justified, and her emails merely reflected normal career anxiety rather than intention to manipulate.\n\nThe combination of these factors occurring innocently is extremely unlikely.\n\n5"

This pattern is highly consistent with someone selectively analyzing data until achieving significance.\n\nModifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is precisely what someone would do when initial analyses didn't produce desired results. This allows retrofitting the analysis plan to match what worked with the collected data.\n\nThe presence of participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded is exactly what we'd expect if someone were selectively removing data points that prevented statistical significance.\n\nThe emails provide clear motivation and intent. Statements about needing \"this one to work\" and concerns about career implications demonstrate the pressure and motivation to manipulate results.\n\nThese behaviors collectively form a coherent pattern that aligns perfectly with deliberate academic misconduct. Each element not only suggests misconduct individually but forms part of a consistent strategy to manufacture significant results.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, these patterns are exactly what we would expect to observe.\n\n95"

Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions represents valid quality control.\n\nSoftware changes mid-project and hard drive failures are common technical issues in research. The IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure provides independent verification of this explanation.\n\nLena's prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit suggests a pattern of proper scientific conduct. This history of good practices makes it more plausible that current issues stem from technical problems rather than misconduct.\n\nThese circumstances - following lab norms for robustness checks, proper participant exclusion documentation, verified technical issues, and a history of good scientific practice - would be quite expected if Lena were conducting legitimate research.\n\n85"
