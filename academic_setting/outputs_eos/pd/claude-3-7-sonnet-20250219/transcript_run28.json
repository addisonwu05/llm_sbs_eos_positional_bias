    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nChanging preregistration documents after data collection directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration and represents a serious breach of research integrity, especially when the changes affect exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nExcluding participants from the final dataset who were in earlier analyses could be legitimate if there were valid methodological reasons, but combined with the other elements, it suggests potential cherry-picking.\n\nThe emails about needing the study \"to work\" show clear motivation for misconduct, though by themselves they only demonstrate pressure, not misconduct.\n\nWhen all these elements occur together:\n- The skewed p-value distribution\n- Post-hoc modification of preregistration\n- Selective participant exclusion\n- Explicit statements showing career pressure\n\nThe probability that all these could occur without intentional misconduct is extremely low. While each individual element might have an innocent explanation, their co-occurrence makes an innocent explanation highly implausible.\n\n20"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, these patterns would be very likely to appear. The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or data manipulation. Modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is precisely what someone might do to ensure favorable results. Excluding certain participants in the final dataset who were in earlier analyses is consistent with selectively removing data points that don't support the desired outcome. The emails expressing career pressure and need for positive results provide clear motivation for such actions. These elements together form a highly coherent pattern that would be expected if misconduct occurred. While not absolutely certain (no evidence is ever 100% conclusive), this pattern of evidence strongly aligns with what we would expect to see in a case of deliberate academic misconduct.\n\n90"

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed.
