The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is designed to prevent \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) and p-hacking by fixing the research plan *before* results are known.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct (i.e., she did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data, or intentionally misrepresent her research process):\n\n1.  **Honest Mistake/Accident:** It is highly unlikely that such a specific and impactful modification (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) could occur due to an \"honest mistake\" like a typo or accidental file save. These changes require deliberate action to alter key methodological details.\n2.  **Gross Negligence/Ignorance of Ethics:** It is *conceivable*, though still a serious ethical failing, that a researcher might, out of extreme ignorance or negligence regarding preregistration principles, genuinely believe it is acceptable to \"correct\" or \"update\" the preregistration document after seeing the data. Under immense pressure, a student might rationalize that the \"new\" criteria/outcomes are \"better science\" and simply edit the document without fully grasping the ethical implications of retroactively altering the official plan to match observed results. This would not be *intentional fraud* in the sense of fabricating data points, but it would still constitute a severe breach of research integrity and falsification of the research record.\n3.  **Ethical Conduct:** An ethically sound researcher, even if they identified a flaw in their preregistered plan *after* data collection, would not retroactively modify the original preregistration document to make it appear as if the new plan was the original. Instead, they would:\n    *   Transparently report the deviation from the original preregistration in their manuscript.\n    *   Explain the reasons for the change and justify it.\n    *   Treat any analyses based on the modified criteria/outcomes as exploratory.\n    *   Publicly amend the preregistration if possible, with clear version control and timestamps indicating when and why the change was made.\n\nThe fact that the document was *modified* after data collection, changing *planned* exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, implies an attempt to make the historical record of the research plan align with the outcomes, rather than transparently reporting a deviation. This action itself is widely considered a form of falsification of the research process or record, which falls under academic misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if Lena *truly did not commit academic misconduct* (meaning she maintained ethical research practices and did not intentionally deceive or misrepresent), this specific action is exceedingly improbable. It would require an extraordinary level of ignorance or a highly implausible series of non-malicious errors that coincidentally resulted in the preregistration aligning with \"clean results.\"\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that this action would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is very low.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 5"

This would serve to mask academic misconduct.\n2.  **Falsification of the Research Record:** Modifying the preregistration document in this manner is a form of falsification of the research record. It misrepresents the actual research process by making it appear as if the final, favorable analyses were the *original* intended analyses. This directly aligns with the definition of academic misconduct, particularly falsification.\n3.  **Pressure and Desired Outcome:** The context highlights significant pressure to produce publishable findings. If the initial, genuinely preregistered analyses didn't produce the \"clean\" results needed, and Lena was driven by misconduct, altering the preregistration would be a strategic move to secure publication and meet grant expectations, making the data \"look too perfect\" as the whistleblower claimed.\n4.  **Consistency with Anonymous Claim:** The anonymous whistleblower specifically claimed that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments.\" While the preregistration modification happened after data collection, it's consistent with a pattern where Lena might have adapted her analysis strategy (and then tried to cover it up with a modified preregistration) to achieve desired results or respond to feedback in a misleading way.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, this specific action is not just possible but a highly effective and common tactic for fabricating the appearance of legitimate, pre-planned research.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 90"

    "content": "It is very common and entirely standard practice in research for an earlier version of an analysis script to include more participants than the final dataset.\n\nHere's why this would be expected even if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n\n1.  **Data Cleaning and Quality Control:** Researchers typically collect data from an initial pool of participants. Before final analysis, they apply pre-defined (or sometimes refined based on initial data quality assessment) exclusion criteria. These criteria might include:\n    *   Participants failing attention checks or comprehension questions.\n    *   Participants whose data is incomplete due to technical glitches or early withdrawal.\n    *   Participants exhibiting extreme outliers in performance that suggest non-compliance or misunderstanding.\n    *   Participants who did not meet specific behavioral or demographic criteria upon closer inspection.\n2.  **Iterative Analysis Process:** An \"earlier version of the analysis script\" suggests an iterative development process. Researchers often start by processing all raw data and then, as they refine their methods and apply quality checks, they introduce steps to exclude certain participants based on established criteria.\n3.  **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** Even with a preregistration, the *precise* application of exclusion criteria can sometimes be refined slightly after initial data collection, provided these refinements are transparently reported and not made in a way that biases the results (e.g., \"p-hacking\" by excluding participants only until a significant p-value is reached). However, simply *having* exclusions is a normal part of the process.\n\nTherefore, finding an older script with more participants, who were subsequently excluded in the final dataset, is a routine aspect of competent data handling and analysis. It only becomes suspicious if the exclusions were arbitrary, undisclosed, or specifically designed to achieve a desired statistical outcome. But the act itself, under the assumption of no misconduct, is expected.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it is also quite likely that an earlier analysis script included more participants than were in the final dataset. However, the *reason* for those exclusions would differ significantly.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **\"P-hacking\" by Exclusion:** One common form of academic misconduct is \"p-hacking,\" where researchers try different analytical approaches until they achieve statistically significant results. This can involve selectively excluding participants until the desired p-value is obtained. If Lena was engaging in this behavior, she might have initially run analyses with all participants, found non-significant results, and then iteratively removed participants (e.g., \"outliers\" that skewed the data away from the hypothesis) until the main effect became significant. The earlier script would then reflect the larger dataset before these selective exclusions.\n2.  **Fabrication/Falsification Background:** Even if the primary misconduct was fabrication or falsification of data (e.g., *changing* data points), the process of arriving at a \"clean\" dataset for publication might still involve strategic exclusions. For instance, if some fabricated data points didn't align well, or if some real participants' data made the fabricated data look less plausible, a dishonest researcher might exclude those participants under the guise of standard data cleaning.\n3.  **Apparent Legitimate Process:** A dishonest researcher often attempts to mimic the appearance of legitimate research. Since legitimate research *does* involve participant exclusions for quality control, having an earlier script with more participants is a natural byproduct of what would *look* like a standard data cleaning process, even if the actual criteria for exclusion were manipulated.\n4.  **Pressure to Publish:** Under pressure to produce \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory,\" if the full dataset didn't yield these results, strategically reducing the sample size or removing inconvenient participants would be a direct route to achieving the desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, the existence of an earlier script with more participants is compatible with both ethical and unethical research practices. The critical difference lies in *why* those participants were excluded – whether based on pre-defined, transparent, and objective criteria, or on a post-hoc, results-driven decision. If Lena committed misconduct, the latter reason for exclusion becomes highly probable.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 85"

PhD students are under immense pressure to produce novel, publishable results that advance their field and secure their future careers.\n2.  **Supervisor Expectations and Grant Pressure:** It is common for supervisors to rely on specific projects for grant renewal. A student whose project is central to a major grant would naturally feel this pressure. Professor Mills \"is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review,\" and this pressure would undoubtedly be relayed to Lena.\n3.  **Career Implications of Results:** A \"null result\" (a finding that does not support the hypothesis) can indeed make it harder to publish in top journals, especially for a \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory.\" While null results are scientifically valuable, the academic system often favors positive, significant findings for career progression. A successful, high-impact publication is crucial for securing a competitive postdoc position.\n4.  **Emotional Expression to a Friend:** Emails to a friend are a natural outlet for expressing stress, anxiety, hopes, and fears about one's career and research. These are not formal communications but personal venting. The phrase \"I need this one to work\" is a common expression of aspiration and high stakes, not necessarily an admission of intent to manipulate data.

While you'd expect more low p-values if there's a real effect, there should be no sharp \"cliff\" exactly at the .05 threshold. Due to natural sampling variability, if you find a p-value of .049, it's just as probable that in a slightly different sample from the same population, you would find a p-value of .051. A complete absence of values just above .05, when many are just below, is statistically improbable under random chance.\n2.  **Exploratory Analyses:** The pattern appearing in \"several exploratory analyses\" is particularly concerning. While exploratory analyses are, by nature, less constrained, they are also more susceptible to \"fishing for significance.\" If a researcher is genuinely exploring, they might run many tests. If they only report or emphasize those that barely cross the .05 threshold while silently setting aside those that fall just short (e.g., .051, .055), this would create the observed pattern. This selective reporting, even if not outright fabrication, is a form of academic misconduct (questionable research practice).\n3.  **Nature of the .05 Threshold:** The .05 threshold is a convention. Nature does not produce effects that precisely stop yielding p-values above .05. The observed pattern strongly suggests that the threshold is being actively used to select or shape results, rather than merely reflecting the underlying statistical properties of the data.\n\nFor this pattern to emerge purely by chance, without any selective reporting, data manipulation, or repeated analyses, would be an extremely rare statistical anomaly. It fundamentally goes against the principles of probability in hypothesis testing.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 5"

When a researcher is motivated to achieve statistically significant results (p < .05) and their initial, legitimate analyses do not yield them, they may engage in various questionable research practices:\n    *   Running multiple exploratory analyses and only reporting those that *just* cross the significance threshold.\n    *   Making minor, post-hoc adjustments to data analysis (e.g., trying different exclusion criteria, adding or removing covariates, transforming variables, using slightly different statistical tests) until a p-value drops just below .05.\n    *   Stopping data collection or analysis when a desired p-value is reached.\n2.  **Pressure as a Motivator:** The information provided highlights significant pressure on Lena: her supervisor \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" a \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and her own declaration \"I need this one to work.\" These are precisely the circumstances that would incentivize a researcher, if they were inclined to misconduct, to manipulate analyses to produce the \"strong, statistically significant support\" reported in the paper.\n3.  **Appearing Legitimate:** A researcher engaging in p-hacking wants to appear as if their results are genuinely significant. Reporting p-values like .047 or .049 achieves this goal while minimizing the appearance of overly dramatic or fabricated results (which might be suspected if all p-values were extremely low, like p < .0001, for all analyses). The goal is to cross the threshold, not necessarily to be overwhelmingly significant.\n4.  **Consistency with Anonymous Whistleblower:** The whistleblower's claim that some data \"look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments\" aligns well with a scenario where p-hacking was used to generate seemingly clean and significant results.\n\nThis specific pattern of p-values is a strong indicator of results-driven analysis, which is a key component of academic misconduct in the form of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

It suggests that these exclusions were part of a proactive data quality control process, decided before the researcher had any motivation to selectively exclude participants to achieve a desired statistical outcome.

Including participants who clearly did not engage with the task (fell asleep) or did not understand instructions would introduce significant noise and invalidate their data, making it harder to obtain \"clean\" or \"perfect\" results, whether genuine or fabricated. Removing such participants is a fundamental step in data cleaning that even a dishonest researcher would likely perform to make their work appear more robust.\n2.  **Maintaining Plausibility:** A researcher committing misconduct often tries to embed their illicit actions within otherwise legitimate scientific practices to avoid detection. Excluding participants for clear, justifiable reasons (like falling asleep or misunderstanding instructions) is a standard and widely accepted practice. Documenting these exclusions *before* the pressure of publication (predating journal submission) helps maintain the appearance of thorough and ethical data handling, even if other aspects of the research process are compromised.\n3.  **Not Counterproductive to Misconduct:** These specific exclusions do not contradict or hinder potential misconduct like p-hacking or data fabrication. In fact, removing \"bad\" data points (like those from non-compliant participants) would make the remaining dataset more uniform, potentially making it easier to manipulate or find desired patterns through p-hacking, or to seamlessly blend fabricated data with real data.\n4.  **Selective Misconduct:** Academic misconduct is not always an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition. A researcher might engage in certain unethical practices (e.g., p-hacking, falsifying preregistration) while still adhering to other fundamental good research practices (e.g., excluding clearly invalid participant data) to maintain an appearance of legitimacy and ensure their core manipulations are effective.\n\nTherefore, the exclusion of these two participants for these specific, well-documented reasons is entirely consistent with both ethical and unethical research practices.

It is highly unlikely to be directly caused by or dependent on an individual's decision to commit academic misconduct. Such a switch would simply be part of the operational environment in which the misconduct might occur.\n2.  **Confirmed Hard Drive Failure and Missing Files:** Hardware failures are technical misfortunes that can happen to anyone. The fact that the IT department \"confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time\" strongly indicates a genuine technical issue. Misconduct does not cause hard drives to fail. Losing some files as a consequence of a legitimate hardware failure is a real-world possibility.\n\nWhile these events are not *caused* by misconduct, they could be *convenient* for someone engaging in misconduct. For instance:\n*   **Missing files due to hard drive failure:** If Lena had committed misconduct (e.g., by modifying the preregistration document or p-hacking), the loss of specific files (like earlier versions of scripts, raw data, or unedited preregistration documents) could coincidentally help conceal her actions or make it harder for investigators to find incriminating evidence. She might even strategically claim certain crucial files were among those lost, even if they weren't, or simply not recover certain files from backups if they contained inconvenient information.\n*   **Software switch:** A change in software might provide an additional layer of complexity or an excuse for certain data processing irregularities, although this link is weaker than with missing files.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the likelihood of the *events occurring*, not the likelihood of them being *exploited* or *convenient* for misconduct. As independent, mundane, and verifiable occurrences, their probability of happening in the real world does not significantly increase or decrease just because Lena might have simultaneously been engaged in misconduct.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood is similar to the scenario where she did not commit misconduct, as these are background circumstances.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 80"

Robustness checks are a cornerstone of good scientific practice. They involve testing whether the main findings hold up under different analytical choices (e.g., varying exclusion criteria, using different statistical models, including/excluding covariates). This demonstrates a commitment to methodological rigor rather than a search for significance.\n2.  **Standard Good Practice:** Running sensitivity analyses with different exclusion criteria (stricter or looser) is a standard and recommended practice to understand the generalizability and stability of one's findings. It shows due diligence.\n3.  **Consistency Across the Lab:** The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" reinforces that this is a recognized, encouraged, and established practice within Professor Mills' lab. If this is the lab culture, an ethical student like Lena would naturally follow suit.\n4.  **Transparency and Documentation:** Storing these multiple scripts in data management logs is a sign of good organizational practice and transparency, which aligns with ethical research.\n\nThis behavior is entirely consistent with, and indeed indicative of, a diligent researcher adhering to high standards of methodological rigor and transparency, especially within a lab that actively promotes such practices.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 99"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still very likely that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Exploitation of Legitimate Practice (P-Hacking Cover):** The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" provides a perfect, pre-existing, and *legitimate* framework for a researcher engaging in p-hacking or selective reporting. If Lena was trying different exclusion criteria or analytical approaches until she achieved a desired significant p-value (a form of academic misconduct), storing these numerous scripts under the umbrella of \"robustness checks\" would make her actions appear entirely ethical and thorough. She could then present the \"successful\" analysis as the one that emerged from robust exploration, even if the exploration's *true* goal was to find significance.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Conformity:** Even if Lena was committing misconduct in specific areas, she would likely adhere to visible lab protocols and expectations to avoid suspicion. If the entire lab is expected to run and store multiple alternative scripts for robustness, her *not* doing so would be a red flag. Therefore, engaging in this practice, even if the underlying intent was compromised, would help her blend in and maintain an image of an ethical researcher.\n3.  **Efficiency in Achieving Desired Results:** From the perspective of someone trying to achieve a specific \"publishable finding,\" systematically exploring different exclusion criteria can be an effective way to \"find\" the analysis that yields the desired statistical significance. The lab's encouragement of this practice would simply provide a ready-made methodology for such a search.\n\nIn essence, this specific lab practice, while designed for ethical purposes, creates an environment where a researcher inclined towards misconduct could easily use it as a cover for their actions. It allows for the generation of numerous analyses, from which a statistically convenient one could be selected and justified as part of the robustness exploration.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 90"

    "content": "It is extremely likely that if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Direct Evidence of Ethical Practice:** A record of \"no prior data irregularities,\" successfully passing an \"independent data audit,\" and receiving ratings of \"well-documented and reproducible\" are all strong indicators of a researcher who adheres to high ethical standards and good scientific practice. These are precisely the traits expected from someone who conducts their research with integrity.\n2.  **Consistency in Behavior:** If Lena is genuinely an ethical researcher (i.e., she did not commit misconduct in the current study), it's highly probable that this ethical approach is consistent across her work. Good habits in data handling, documentation, and reproducibility are fundamental to ethical research and tend to be consistent traits of a researcher.\n3.  **Audits as Verification:** Independent data audits are specifically designed to verify the integrity and quality of research data and methods. Passing such an audit provides strong external validation of Lena's ethical conduct in her previous work.\n\nIn short, a strong positive record is exactly what one would expect from an ethical and competent researcher.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 99"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still quite likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Misconduct Can Be Situational:** Academic misconduct is often not a consistent pattern of behavior but can be triggered by specific, intense pressures and circumstances. In this case, Lena is a third-year PhD student, her supervisor is under pressure for a major grant, and \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc.\" This level of pressure might be unprecedented for Lena, leading her to make ethically compromised decisions in *this* specific high-stakes project, even if her previous work was conducted with integrity.\n2.  **Maintaining a Façade of Competence:** A researcher who commits misconduct might still be highly competent and meticulous in their general research practices. Passing audits and having \"well-documented and reproducible\" work are signs of good organizational skills and attention to detail. These qualities can paradoxically make someone more effective at concealing misconduct, as their \"normal\" work appears impeccable, reducing suspicion.\n3.  **Building Trust and Reputation:** A strong prior record helps build trust and a reputation for reliability. If Lena intended to engage in misconduct, having a clean past record would make her actions less likely to be scrutinized and more easily dismissed as \"honest mistakes\" if irregularities were found.\n4.  **Learning or Escalation:** It's possible that Lena learned methods for more sophisticated data handling or analysis during her earlier projects that helped her pass audits, and *then* applied that knowledge, along with a compromised ethical compass, to manipulate the current project.\n\nTherefore, a strong prior record, while making the *overall* probability of misconduct lower, does not make it *unlikely* that someone who *did* commit misconduct would possess such a record. The specific pressures of the current study could represent a breaking point for someone who was previously diligent.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 75"

    "content": "Based on the provided evidence, here's an evaluation of the likelihood of Lena having committed academic misconduct:\n\n**Evidence Strongly Indicating Misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Modified Preregistration Document (after data collection):** This is a critical piece of evidence. Preregistration is designed to prevent post-hoc changes to research plans. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes *after* data collection to match favorable results is a direct form of falsifying the research record and constitutes academic misconduct, specifically \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) or p-hacking. The likelihood of this happening without misconduct is extremely low (5%).\n2.  **P-Value Distribution (unusually concentrated just below .05, almost none above):** This is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It suggests that analyses were tweaked, or results were selectively presented, to achieve statistical significance. For this pattern to occur randomly in multiple analyses is statistically improbable without some form of manipulation. The likelihood of this happening without misconduct is extremely low (5%).\n3.  **Emails Expressing Extreme Pressure:** While not direct proof of misconduct, Lena's emails (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") reveal immense pressure and a strong personal motive to achieve positive results. This context makes the potential for misconduct more understandable, as these pressures are common motivators.\n4.  **Anonymous Whistleblower Claim:** The claim that data \"look too perfect\" and analyses were changed after reviews aligns with the patterns seen in the preregistration and p-value distribution.\n\n**Evidence Suggesting Ethical Conduct or Providing Mundane Explanations:**\n\n1.  **Earlier Script with More Participants:** This is a routine part of data cleaning and analysis, common in ethical research.\n2.  **Exclusion of Participants (fell asleep/didn't understand):** This is standard and ethical data quality control, well-documented and predating submission.\n3.  **Lab Software Switch and Confirmed Hard Drive Failure:** These are verifiable, mundane technical issues that can lead to missing files and are not indicative of misconduct themselves. While they could potentially be *used* as an excuse, the events are externally confirmed.\n4.  **Lab-wide Push for Robustness (multiple analysis scripts):** Running different analyses to check robustness is an ethical and good scientific practice. However, this practice could potentially be *exploited* as a cover for p-hacking if a researcher were inclined to misconduct.\n5.  **Strong Prior Record (no irregularities, passed audits, well-documented):** This is a significant piece of evidence in Lena's favor, suggesting a history of careful and ethical data handling. It makes it less likely that she would suddenly engage in misconduct.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe most damning pieces of evidence are the **retroactively modified preregistration document** and the **suspicious p-value distribution**. These are not \"mundane explanations\" or \"honest mistakes\" in the typical sense; they are specific actions and outcomes that directly violate research integrity principles and are strong indicators of intentional manipulation to achieve desired results. The intense pressure Lena felt provides a clear motive.\n\nWhile Lena's strong prior record is a powerful counter-argument, it primarily suggests she *was* ethical and competent, not that she *couldn't* succumb to pressure in a high-stakes situation for the *current* study. The mundane explanations account for some irregularities (like missing files or having multiple scripts) but do not explain away the two core issues of falsified preregistration and p-hacking.\n\nThe combination of clear statistical anomalies and direct evidence of manipulating the research plan, coupled with a strong motive, outweighs the general evidence of past good conduct and neutral technical issues.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"
