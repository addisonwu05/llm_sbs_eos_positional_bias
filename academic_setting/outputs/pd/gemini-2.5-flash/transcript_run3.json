The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The question asks for the likelihood of a specific pattern in the data (an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with almost none just above .05 for several exploratory analyses) *if Lena did not commit academic misconduct*. The scenario defines \"no academic misconduct\" as the results being genuine and any errors being unintentional.\n\nThis particular pattern of p-values, often called a \"p-cliff\" or \"p-value just-below-.05 heap,\" is a widely recognized statistical signature of questionable research practices, specifically p-hacking or selective reporting. It suggests that researchers may have:\n1.  Run multiple exploratory analyses and only reported those that happened to achieve statistical significance (p < .05).\n2.  Made analytical choices (e.g., removing outliers, transforming data, adding covariates) specifically to push p-values below the .05 threshold.\n3.  Stopped data collection once significance was achieved, even if initially planning a larger sample size.\n\nIf Lena did *not* commit academic misconduct, it implies that her research practices were entirely unbiased, transparent, and ethically sound. In such a scenario:\n*   **If there were no true effects** in these exploratory analyses, the p-values should be uniformly distributed across the range [0, 1]. In this case, finding an \"unusually high concentration\" just below .05 while simultaneously having \"almost no\" values just above .05 would be an extraordinarily rare statistical fluke.\n*   **If there were genuine true effects**, p-values would generally cluster towards zero, but there would be no inherent statistical reason for them to specifically bunch up *just below* .05 and abruptly stop there, avoiding values like .051 or .052. The .05 threshold is an arbitrary convention for decision-making, not a natural discontinuity in underlying phenomena.\n\nTherefore, the described pattern strongly suggests a non-random process influenced by the .05 significance threshold. This kind of pattern is not expected to arise from genuinely unbiased data and analysis, nor from \"honest mistakes\" like software switches or hard drive failures. While some researchers might engage in p-hacking without malicious intent (e.g., due to pressure or lack of awareness about best practices), the *outcome* is still a biased and misleading representation of the data, which would typically be considered a form of misconduct or at least a serious deviation from good scientific practice.\n\nGiven that \"no academic misconduct\" implies the results are genuine and errors are unintentional (meaning the data truly reflects reality without bias or intentional manipulation), the likelihood of this highly specific and problematic p-value distribution occurring is extremely low. It would require an improbable series of coincidences or a profound misunderstanding of statistical reporting that coincidentally mimics the most common sign of p-hacking.\n\nProbability judgment: 1"

If a researcher is actively trying to push p-values across this threshold, they would naturally accumulate results that are \"just significant,\" leading to a cluster around .04 to .049 and an artificial scarcity of values like .051 or .052.\n2.  **Selective Reporting:** If a researcher runs many exploratory analyses but only reports those that achieve statistical significance (p < .05), and suppresses those that don't, this would create a dataset that *appears* to have many significant findings. If many of the true effects are weak or non-existent, the reported significant p-values might frequently be those that just barely made the cut.\n3.  **Data Falsification/Fabrication:** In cases of outright falsification, a researcher might alter data points or directly change reported p-values to achieve significance. It is plausible that they would aim for values that appear significant but not \"too significant\" (e.g., p=.047 rather than p=.00001, which might raise different kinds of suspicion), contributing to the cluster just below .05.\n\nThe context of Professor Mills being \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review\" and the submission to a \"top journal\" creates strong incentives to achieve statistically significant results. If Lena succumbed to this pressure and engaged in misconduct, the observed p-value pattern is a direct statistical signature of such actions.

Its core purpose is to increase transparency and reduce bias in research findings.\n\nModifying a preregistration document *after* data has already been collected, specifically to change planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly undermines the integrity and purpose of preregistration.\n*   **Changing primary outcomes post-hoc** allows a researcher to select the analyses that happen to yield significant results from a larger set of exploratory analyses, making them appear as pre-specified confirmatory findings. This is a form of outcome switching or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) and introduces bias into the reported findings.\n*   **Changing exclusion criteria post-hoc** allows a researcher to remove or include participants based on how their data affects the results, potentially pushing p-values below significance or strengthening desired effects. This is a form of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it means her research practices were entirely ethical, transparent, and free from any intention to mislead or bias the results. In such a scenario, she would adhere to the principles of good scientific practice. Altering a preregistration document in this way *after* data collection is fundamentally contrary to these principles and is widely considered a highly questionable research practice, if not outright misconduct, because it introduces the very biases preregistration aims to prevent.\n\nWhile one might argue for an extremely rare circumstance where an *honest mistake* or a *genuine, unforeseen methodological necessity* led to such a change, best practice in such a situation would involve:\n1.  Publicly documenting the change, including the precise reasons for it, *after* the initial preregistration.\n2.  Clearly distinguishing between pre-registered and post-hoc (exploratory) analyses in the final publication.\n3.  Maintaining the original preregistration as part of the public record, rather than simply modifying it.\n\nSimply changing the document as described, without transparent public amendment or explanation, is a strong indicator of an attempt to retroactively legitimize analyses or criteria that were not initially planned. It directly mimics behavior associated with misconduct aimed at achieving desired results. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this specific action would occur if Lena's conduct was entirely above board and free of any intent to manipulate or misrepresent.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

If Lena ran multiple analyses, including exploratory ones, and found significance in an outcome that wasn't originally designated as primary, or if she found better results by applying different exclusion criteria, modifying the preregistration retroactively would allow her to present these findings as pre-planned and confirmatory. This obscures the fact that she may have engaged in p-hacking or outcome switching.\n2.  **Legitimizing Biased Choices:** By changing exclusion criteria after data collection, a researcher can effectively \"cherry-pick\" participants whose data support the desired hypothesis, or remove those who weaken it. Retroactively changing the preregistration makes this selective process appear legitimate and pre-specified.\n3.  **Responding to Pressure:** Given the supervisor's pressure for \"publishable findings\" and the goal of submission to a \"top journal,\" there's a strong incentive to ensure the final paper presents strong, significant results. If initial pre-registered analyses or outcomes were not yielding the desired results, a researcher committing misconduct would be highly motivated to alter the plan to align with what the data *did* show as significant.\n4.  **Cover-up:** This action is a direct attempt to circumvent the transparency and bias-prevention mechanisms that preregistration is designed to provide. It creates a false record of scientific intent, making it appear as though the analysis plan was set before seeing the data, when in reality it was altered to fit the observed results.\n\nTherefore, if Lena were engaging in academic misconduct, especially to secure positive results for publication, manipulating the preregistration document in this specific manner would be a very effective and common strategy.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This is because:\n\n1.  **Application of Pre-defined Exclusion Criteria:** Most studies have pre-defined exclusion criteria (e.g., participants who did not complete the task, failed attention checks, had excessive technical artifacts in their data, or whose data quality was compromised). Researchers typically collect data from all participants and then apply these criteria during the data cleaning and processing phase. An earlier script might reflect the raw, uncleaned dataset, while later versions reflect the refined dataset after exclusions have been applied.\n2.  **Iterative Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning is often an iterative process. As researchers delve deeper into their data, they might identify issues (e.g., participants not understanding instructions, technical glitches impacting specific sessions) that necessitate exclusion, even if not explicitly foreseen in the initial plan. As long as these exclusions are justified, transparently reported, and not made to manipulate results, they are considered standard practice.\n3.  **Development of Analysis Pipeline:** Early scripts might be \"test runs\" or preliminary versions used to check raw data, including all participants, before the full data cleaning and exclusion pipeline is formalized and applied.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it means her exclusions would be based on objective, pre-defined, or scientifically justifiable criteria (e.g., data quality, task compliance) rather than an attempt to manipulate results. The existence of an earlier script with more participants simply indicates that the data cleaning and exclusion process had not yet been fully implemented or finalized in that earlier version.

If Lena was aiming to achieve specific results (e.g., p < .05), she might run preliminary analyses with all collected data. If those results were not favorable, she could then identify participants whose removal would improve the statistical outcome and exclude them. The earlier script would reflect the dataset *before* these selective exclusions were made for the purpose of manipulating results.\n2.  **Outcome-Dependent Data Cleaning:** While legitimate data cleaning is common, misconduct could involve applying exclusion criteria *after* inspecting the results, specifically to achieve significance. An earlier script might show the data before these outcome-dependent criteria were applied.\n3.  **Covering Tracks:** If Lena were engaging in misconduct, she would ultimately present a final dataset and analysis script that supports her desired findings. The existence of an earlier script with more participants could be a trace of the \"messier\" or \"unfavorable\" data she started with before applying manipulations like selective exclusions.\n\nIn essence, if Lena committed misconduct, manipulating participant exclusions is a plausible and effective way to achieve desired statistical outcomes.

Grant funding is essential for labs, and the success of key experiments often directly impacts grant renewals. It is completely normal for a PhD student to be aware of and feel the weight of this financial pressure on their supervisor and the lab.\n2.  **Career Stakes:** For a third-year PhD student, publishing significant, high-profile findings is often crucial for securing a postdoctoral position and advancing their career. A \"null result\" (i.e., findings that do not support the hypothesis or are not statistically significant) can indeed be perceived as less \"publishable\" in top journals, which can make it harder to build a competitive CV for future academic roles. This is a very common and legitimate anxiety among graduate students.\n3.  **Human Desire for Success:** Researchers dedicate years of their lives to their work, investing immense intellectual and emotional effort. It is entirely natural to deeply *want* a study to \"work,\" meaning to yield results that support their hypotheses or reveal interesting findings. This desire is part of the passion for discovery, distinct from an intent to fabricate.\n4.  **Private Communication:** These are emails to a friend, a context where one is typically more candid and expressive about personal feelings, anxieties, and ambitions than in a formal setting.\n\nThe content of these emails reflects the intense pressure and high stakes common in academic research.

When the perceived consequences of \"failure\" (e.g., a null result, non-publication) are severe for one's career or their supervisor's funding, the temptation to manipulate data or results can increase significantly.\n2.  **Emotional Expression:** These emails represent a candid expression of Lena's internal state, fears, and desires related to the project.

An otherwise diligent and ethical researcher might succumb to these pressures.\n2.  **Distinction between Skill and Ethics:** Being \"well-documented and reproducible\" speaks to a researcher's technical skills, organizational habits, and adherence to transparent scientific practices in terms of data management and analysis.

A researcher might be unethical in one area while still being proficient and responsible in others, like basic data quality control.\n4.  **Early Identification:** Issues like participants falling asleep or not understanding instructions are usually identified during data collection or initial data checks, leading to immediate decisions about their exclusion, which would naturally predate later stages like journal submission.\n\nTherefore, the occurrence of legitimate, well-documented exclusions for clear reasons like these is largely independent of whether other forms of misconduct are also occurring in the study.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

Good scientific practice often involves testing the sensitivity of results to different analytical choices, including varying exclusion criteria. Researchers might want to know if their primary findings hold up under stricter participant selection, or if they are still present when including participants who might be borderline. This is a legitimate way to understand the generalizability and reliability of their findings.\n2.  **Best Practices in Transparency and Reproducibility:** Running and *storing* multiple scripts is excellent practice. It creates a detailed audit trail of all analyses performed, supporting transparency and enabling future researchers (or auditors) to reproduce not just the final analysis but also the exploration that led to it.\n3.  **Lab Culture and Training:** If this is a \"lab-wide push,\" it suggests that Lena is following her lab's established protocols and receiving training that emphasizes this type of rigorous data exploration. The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns\" reinforces that this is a systematic and accepted practice within the research group, not an anomaly unique to Lena.\n4.  **Opposite of Misconduct:** This behavior is, in fact, the opposite of trying to hide or manipulate results. A researcher engaging in p-hacking or selective reporting might run many analyses but would typically only present the \"successful\" one, possibly discarding or not properly archiving the \"unsuccessful\" ones. The scenario describes a transparent and comprehensive approach to analysis.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is an ethical and competent researcher, this pattern of work is not only plausible but highly indicative of responsible and thorough scientific practice.\n\nProbability judgment: 98"

A researcher seeking statistically significant results might try different ways to clean and filter the data until a desired outcome is achieved. So, the *act* of running these various scripts is perfectly consistent with misconduct.\n2.  **Conforming to Lab Policy (and creating a plausible deniability):** The scenario explicitly states this is \"part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns.\" This indicates a strong, established lab culture and potentially a required data management practice. Even if Lena were committing misconduct, she would likely adhere to this lab standard by saving all her scripts. This would help her maintain an appearance of following best practices and could even serve as a form of plausible deniability if questioned (\"I was just exploring robustness, as per lab policy, and this is the final, most robust analysis I found\").\n3.  **Hiding Intent, Not Actions:** While the *intent* behind choosing the final reported analysis might be fraudulent, the *action* of exploring different analytical paths and documenting them could still be carried out. The misconduct might lie in selectively reporting only the \"successful\" outcome-driven analysis, rather than transparently acknowledging the exploratory nature or the effect of different choices.\n\nTherefore, the physical existence of these logs is highly probable, regardless of Lena's ethical conduct, given the described lab environment and the nature of p-hacking.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

    "content": "Based on the evidence presented, there are several strong indicators pointing towards academic misconduct, while some other pieces of evidence offer plausible alternative explanations or simply describe common occurrences in research.\n\nLet's break down the evidence and its implications:\n\n**Evidence Strongly Suggesting Misconduct (Hard to explain otherwise):**\n\n1.  **P-value distribution:** The \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. If the results were genuinely found without bias or manipulation, such a distribution would be an extraordinary statistical anomaly, especially across \"several exploratory analyses.\" (P(E|No Misconduct)=1, P(E|Misconduct)=95).\n2.  **Preregistration document modified after data collection:** Changing planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes *after* the data had been collected directly undermines the purpose of preregistration. This is a clear indication of outcome switching or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known), designed to retroactively legitimize post-hoc decisions made after seeing the data. (P(E|No Misconduct)=5, P(E|Misconduct)=90).\n\n**Evidence Providing Context/Motive (Consistent with misconduct, but not proof):**\n\n3.  **Emails expressing pressure:** Lena's emails about the grant, her postdoc chances, and her need for the study to \"work\" illustrate intense pressure and strong motivation to achieve positive results. While these feelings are common among PhD students, they represent a significant incentive that could lead to misconduct. (P(E|No Misconduct)=95, P(E|Misconduct)=95).\n\n**Evidence that is Ambiguous or Neutral (Common occurrences, or could be used to explain away issues):**\n\n4.  **Earlier analysis script with more participants:** It's common for initial scripts to include all participants before applying legitimate exclusion criteria. While this *could* be exploited for selective exclusion, its presence alone isn't strong evidence of misconduct. (P(E|No Misconduct)=90, P(E|Misconduct)=85).\n5.  **Lab switched software, confirmed hard drive failure leading to missing files:** These are mundane technical and logistical challenges that happen frequently in research. While they could serve as convenient excuses for missing or altered data if misconduct occurred, their intrinsic likelihood is independent of misconduct. (P(E|No Misconduct)=90, P(E|Misconduct)=90).\n\n**Evidence Leaning Against Misconduct (Suggesting good practice or prior integrity):**\n\n6.  **No prior record of data irregularities; previous projects passed audit and were \"well-documented and reproducible\":** This indicates Lena generally follows good scientific practices and is competent in data handling. However, misconduct can be a first-time offense, especially under unique pressures. (P(E|No Misconduct)=95, P(E|Misconduct)=70).\n7.  **Two participants legitimately excluded with notes predating submission:** This demonstrates appropriate data cleaning for clear reasons, documented transparently and proactively. This is good scientific practice. (P(E|No Misconduct)=98, P(E|Misconduct)=90).\n8.  **Lab logs show multiple alternative analysis scripts for robustness, similar to other students:** This reflects a lab-wide culture of rigorous data exploration and transparency, which is a good practice. While a researcher might still selectively report from these explorations, the *documentation* of them is positive. (P(E|No Misconduct)=98, P(E|Misconduct)=90).\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe strongest evidence against Lena are the highly improbable p-value distribution and the post-hoc manipulation of the preregistration document. These are not easily explained by \"honest mistakes\" or \"unintentional errors.\" They directly point to actions taken to make results appear stronger or more pre-planned than they genuinely were. The pressure Lena felt provides a clear motive for such actions.\n\nWhile Lena has a good prior record and some of her practices align with good science (like legitimate exclusions and documenting robustness checks), these do not negate the direct evidence of highly problematic data and procedural manipulation in the current high-stakes study. A researcher can be generally competent and ethical but succumb to pressure in a specific, critical project. The \"mundane explanations\" account for missing files or logistical changes, but not for the specific pattern of p-values or the retroactive changes to the preregistration.\n\nConsidering the cumulative weight of the \"smoking gun\" evidence (p-values and preregistration changes), which are extremely unlikely under a \"no misconduct\" scenario, compared to the less decisive or mitigating evidence, the probability of misconduct appears high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"
