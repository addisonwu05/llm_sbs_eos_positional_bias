The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is designed to prevent post-hoc changes influenced by the observed data, thereby guarding against practices like p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies that her intent was not to intentionally manipulate or fabricate data. However, the action of modifying the preregistration document in this way still needs to be explained.\n\nHere are possible scenarios if Lena did not commit *intentional* academic misconduct:\n\n1.  **Profound Misunderstanding or Ignorance of Preregistration Principles:** Lena might have genuinely misunderstood the fundamental principle that a preregistration document is an immutable commitment made *before* data collection. She might have viewed it as a \"living document\" to be refined, even after data were collected. While possible, this level of misunderstanding would be unusual for a third-year PhD student, especially one with a \"strong record of careful data handling,\" in a field increasingly adopting preregistration.\n2.  **Genuine Error in Initial Preregistration with Incorrect Correction:** It's conceivable that the original preregistration contained a critical flaw (e.g., unworkable exclusion criteria, a fundamentally flawed primary outcome measure) that only became apparent after data collection. In this scenario, Lena, without intending fraud, might have chosen the incorrect method of correction by modifying the original document rather than transparently documenting a deviation or addendum. This would still be a severe lapse in judgment and adherence to ethical guidelines, but not necessarily intentional fraud.\n3.  **Pressure from Supervisor (Professor Mills):** Professor Mills, under pressure for publishable findings, might have directed Lena to make these changes, framing them as \"corrections\" or \"clarifications.\" Lena, as a PhD student under the authority of her supervisor, might have complied without fully grasping the ethical implications or without having her own intent to commit fraud. In this case, the *intent to manipulate* might originate with the supervisor, while Lena's own intent was to follow instructions, even if the action itself constitutes misconduct.\n\n**Evaluation of Likelihood:**\n\nEven under these \"innocent\" scenarios, the specific act of retroactively changing *exclusion criteria* and *primary outcomes* in a preregistration document is highly unusual and problematic. These are precisely the elements most prone to manipulation to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n*   The fact that these modifications were discovered via *file timestamps* and not transparently declared as deviations further suggests a lack of proper ethical conduct, even if the underlying intent was not fraudulent.\n*   While Lena has a \"strong record of careful data handling,\" this doesn't automatically extend to perfect understanding and adherence to evolving preregistration ethical norms, especially under pressure.\n*   However, the scientific community has established preregistration precisely to prevent such post-hoc changes. For such a critical change to occur without *any* intent to manipulate the results—whether due to profound ignorance, severe negligence, or external pressure—is an extremely rare and unfortunate combination of circumstances. It represents a fundamental breakdown in expected research practices.\n\nConsidering these points, while not strictly impossible, it is highly unlikely that a preregistration document would be modified in this manner (changing core analytical decisions after data collection, without transparency) if the individual performing the action did not harbor an intention to commit academic misconduct. The action itself, regardless of intent, deeply undermines the integrity of the research process.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 5"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it implies an intentional effort to manipulate or falsify data to achieve desired outcomes. Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection, specifically to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a classic and highly effective method for achieving such results without outright fabricating raw data.\n\nHere's why this action is very likely if Lena committed misconduct:\n\n1.  **P-hacking and HARKing:** Changing exclusion criteria allows researchers to selectively remove data points that might weaken statistical significance or support for the hypothesis. Changing primary outcomes after seeing the data allows one to \"p-hack\" by selecting the outcome measure that *did* yield statistically significant results, even if it wasn't the originally intended primary outcome. Both are forms of academic misconduct or highly questionable research practices aimed at producing publishable \"positive\" findings.\n2.  **Addressing \"Too Perfect\" Data:** If initial analyses didn't yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support,\" retroactively adjusting exclusion criteria or primary outcomes is a direct way to sculpt the data and analyses to achieve those \"clean results\" that later \"look too perfect.\"\n3.  **Pressure for Publication:** Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings.\" This context provides a strong motivation for a researcher intending misconduct to use methods that can ensure positive results, and post-hoc changes to preregistration are precisely such methods.\n4.  **Cover-up Attempt:** The fact that these changes were uncovered via *file timestamps* rather than being openly declared as post-hoc deviations from the preregistration (which, while still problematic, would be more transparent) further suggests an intent to conceal the manipulation. If the intent was to commit misconduct, covertly changing the preregistration document itself would be a way to create a false record of legitimate, pre-planned analysis.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is not just a possibility, but a highly probable strategy that directly serves the purpose of manipulating results to achieve statistically significant and publishable findings. It aligns perfectly with the mechanisms of generating \"too perfect\" data and \"clean results\" under pressure.\n\n95"

    "content": "It is highly likely that Lena would express these sentiments in private emails to a friend, even if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Academic Pressure is Pervasive:** The academic environment, especially for PhD students nearing the end of their studies, is incredibly high-pressure. There's immense pressure to publish, secure grants, and demonstrate research productivity for future career prospects (like postdocs).\n2.  **Supervisor Expectations:** Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This pressure inevitably trickles down to Lena. It is completely normal for a PhD student to be acutely aware of their supervisor's reliance on their work for grant success.\n3.  **Career Stakes for PhD Students:** For a third-year PhD student, the success of a \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory\" is often directly tied to their ability to secure a postdoc position. A \"null result\" (i.e., the hypothesis is not supported), while scientifically valid, can be perceived as less \"publishable\" in top journals, which in turn can indeed hurt postdoc prospects. This anxiety is very common and real.\n4.  **\"I need this one to work\"**: This statement expresses a strong desire for the experiment to yield the predicted, positive results. This desire for success and validation of one's hard work and hypothesis is natural for any researcher. It reflects hope and the understanding of high stakes, rather than an explicit intent to manipulate the data. An honest researcher *wants* their hypothesis to be supported and their hard work to lead to significant findings.\n\nThese statements reflect common anxieties, pressures, and hopes experienced by PhD students. They indicate the high stakes involved for Lena and her supervisor, but they do not, by themselves, suggest an intent to commit fraud. An honest researcher under these circumstances would very likely feel and express such intense desires for a successful outcome.\n\n90"

They reveal a situation where the individual feels trapped between significant pressure to produce results and the dire personal and professional consequences of failure.\n3.  **Consistency with Action:** If Lena intentionally manipulated or fabricated data, it would align perfectly with her strong desire for the study to \"work\" and her fear of the negative repercussions of a null result. These emails essentially lay bare the underlying reasons *why* someone in her position might choose to commit misconduct.\n\nTherefore, these emails are not just consistent with a scenario of misconduct, but they provide strong evidence of the intense psychological and professional pressures that often precede and explain such actions.\n\n98"

Researchers frequently run initial scripts on the full raw dataset before systematically applying all pre-defined or later-identified legitimate exclusion criteria (e.g., participants who did not follow instructions, had technical issues, showed poor data quality, or did not meet specific demographic requirements for the final analysis). The \"earlier version\" of the script might represent a stage before these exclusions were fully implemented or refined.\n2.  **Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection:** Even with careful data collection, some participants' data might need to be removed due to outliers, invalid responses, or other data quality issues that only become apparent during the analysis phase. An earlier script might not have included these cleaning steps yet.\n3.  **Iterative Process:** Scientific analysis is often an iterative process. Researchers might start with a broader dataset, explore it, and then refine their participant pool based on better understanding of the data or specific methodological requirements.\n4.  **\"Honest Mistakes\" or Workflow Evolution:** As Lena herself stated, irregularities could be due to \"honest mistakes.\" An earlier script might have simply included participants by error that were then correctly removed. The lab's switch in software could also lead to transitional scripts or data handling practices that might evolve, leading to differences between versions.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants, by itself, does not indicate misconduct if the exclusions in the final dataset are legitimate and were not performed to manipulate the results. It's a common part of the data processing pipeline to refine the participant pool. The crucial factor is *why* participants were excluded. If Lena did not commit misconduct, those exclusions must have been based on valid scientific or methodological reasons, even if the documentation (like the preregistration) for *when* those criteria were decided upon is problematic.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is very likely that an earlier analysis script would include more participants than the final dataset, with certain participants later excluded.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Method of P-Hacking:** Selectively excluding participants after initial analyses is a common form of p-hacking. If a researcher is attempting to manipulate results to achieve statistical significance, they might run analyses, identify participants whose data weaken the desired effect or introduce noise, and then remove them. An earlier script would naturally reflect the state before these data-driven exclusions were made.\n2.  **Changing Exclusion Criteria:** The information already provided states that the preregistration document was modified after data collection to *change some of the planned exclusion criteria*. This is a direct mechanism for misconduct. An earlier script would likely reflect the *original* (or an even broader) set of participants before these new, outcome-driven exclusion criteria were applied to clean up the dataset and achieve desired results.\n3.  **Achieving \"Clean\" Results:** Removing participants whose data are inconsistent, noisy, or simply don't support the hypothesis is a way to make the results \"look too perfect\" and achieve \"clean\" statistical significance. The \"earlier version\" of the script would then represent the data *before* this \"cleaning\" for misconduct purposes.\n4.  **Covering Tracks:** If the misconduct involved post-hoc exclusions, having an earlier script without these exclusions might indicate the initial, unmanipulated state of the data before the researcher (committing misconduct) began to refine the dataset to get the desired p-values.\n\nTherefore, the existence of an earlier analysis script containing more participants, some of whom were later excluded, is highly consistent with a scenario where academic misconduct was committed through the manipulation of the dataset.\n\n95"

For such a pattern to emerge naturally, without any form of conscious or unconscious bias in selecting analyses, reporting outcomes, or tweaking parameters, would be an extraordinary statistical coincidence.\n\nHere's why it's highly unlikely:\n\n1.  **Statistical Improbability:** In a world without manipulation, p-values should be continuously distributed. If there is a true effect, p-values would generally be lower. However, there's no theoretical reason for them to preferentially cluster *just* below an arbitrary threshold like .05 and then abruptly disappear above it. This sharp cutoff strongly suggests that the .05 threshold was used as a decision rule for reporting or continuing analysis.\n2.  **Exploratory Analyses:** While exploratory analyses inherently involve more flexibility, they should still reflect the underlying data without bias towards a specific p-value range. For *several* such analyses to coincidentally land just below .05, without any falling just above, defies reasonable statistical expectation.\n3.  **Lack of Mechanism:** If no misconduct occurred, there's no underlying mechanism that would cause such a pattern. It would have to be due to sheer, incredibly specific chance, where the true effects happened to align perfectly with the .05 threshold across multiple tests, and any analyses that *would* have yielded p-values just above .05 either didn't exist or weren't conducted. This stretches credulity.\n\nTherefore, while no statistical outcome is absolutely impossible, the probability of this specific pattern arising purely by chance, without any form of intentional or even unintentional (but still problematic) manipulation (like selective reporting or stopping rules), is extremely low. It is a very strong indicator of questionable research practices aimed at achieving publishable results.\n\n5"

The most direct way to achieve this without outright fabricating raw data is to manipulate the analysis process until the p-values reach the desired threshold.\n3.  **Threshold-Driven Behavior:** A researcher engaging in p-hacking would continue to tweak their analyses until a p-value of, for example, .051 or .050 became .049 or .048. Once they achieve a p-value just below .05, they would typically stop, as that meets the \"publishable\" criterion. Conversely, any analysis that yielded a p-value just *above* .05 would likely be discarded, modified, or not reported, leading to the observed \"cliff\" effect.\n4.  **Consistency with Other Evidence:** The pressure from Professor Mills, Lena's personal anxieties (\"I need this one to work,\" fear of null results), and the post-hoc modification of preregistration criteria (which allows for selective analysis and exclusion) all point to a scenario where such p-hacking would be a natural consequence of intentional misconduct. The \"too perfect\" data complaint further aligns with this outcome.\n\nTherefore, this p-value distribution is precisely what one would expect to see if academic misconduct, specifically p-hacking, occurred.\n\n99"

Lena could legitimately run many variations, observe the p-values, and then *selectively report* or refine her final analysis to match the one that yielded the desired statistically significant results (e.g., p-values just below .05).\n2.  **Plausible Deniability:** The existence of multiple scripts with varying exclusion criteria, consistent with lab-wide practice, allows Lena to claim that any \"perfect\" results or changes in exclusion criteria were merely part of this legitimate robustness exploration, rather than intentional manipulation. This provides a convenient explanation for the patterns found.\n3.  **Hiding in Plain Sight:** If \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts,\" Lena's activities would not immediately stand out as suspicious. Her misconduct (e.g., the *selection* and *reporting* of specific analyses, or the *timing* of preregistration changes relative to specific analysis runs) could be masked by the general lab practice.\n4.  **Means to an End:** The ability to run analyses with \"stricter and looser exclusion criteria\" is precisely how one might p-hack to achieve significance, especially when combined with the post-hoc modification of preregistration criteria. The lab's policy effectively provides the tools for this type of manipulation.\n\nTherefore, this lab practice would not prevent misconduct, but rather provide a fertile ground and plausible deniability for it.\n\n95"

Their data would likely not reflect the intended cognitive processes being measured, thus biasing or invalidating the results.\n2.  **Good Research Practice:** Documenting these issues directly in the raw data files (e.g., in a participant log or metadata) and making exclusion decisions based on these notes is a hallmark of careful and ethical data handling.\n3.  **Timing (Predating Submission):** The fact that these notes and, implicitly, the exclusion decisions, predate any journal submission is critical. It indicates that the exclusions were made for purely methodological reasons, *before* any pressure to produce publishable findings for a specific journal, thus demonstrating an unbiased approach to data quality.\n4.  **Consistency with \"Careful Data Handling\":** This specific action aligns perfectly with Lena's previously \"strong record of careful data handling.\" An honest and diligent researcher would routinely identify and document such problematic participants early in the data processing pipeline.\n\nThis evidence strongly supports the idea of careful and ethical research conduct, exactly what one would expect from a researcher not committing misconduct.\n\n99"

Even a researcher intending to commit misconduct would typically exclude such participants because their data are genuinely compromised and would likely only introduce noise or potentially even work *against* desired findings. Including them would rarely serve a manipulative purpose.\n2.  **Standard Good Practice:** These types of exclusions are fundamental to maintaining data quality. A researcher, even if committing other forms of misconduct, would likely still adhere to these basic, undisputed data cleaning practices.\n3.  **Maintaining Plausible Deniability/Credibility:** Performing routine and legitimate data exclusions, and documenting them properly and early, could be a way to maintain an appearance of careful and ethical research conduct, even while engaging in misconduct in more ambiguous or subtle areas (like post-hoc changes to preregistration or selective reporting of exploratory analyses).\n4.  **Timing:** The fact that these notes predate the journal submission indicates the decision was made relatively early, likely during the initial data cleaning phase, before the most intense pressure or need for specific p-values might have fully materialized.\n\nTherefore, this specific action of legitimate participant exclusion is perfectly compatible with a broader pattern of academic misconduct. Misconduct doesn't mean *all* research practices are fraudulent; it can be targeted to achieve specific results.\n\n90"

    "content": "Based on the entirety of the evidence presented, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct appears very high.\n\nHere's a summary of the evidence and its implications:\n\n**Evidence Strongly Indicating Misconduct:**\n\n*   **Preregistration Document Modified Post-Data Collection (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes):** This is arguably the most damning piece of evidence. Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent such post-hoc changes to reduce researcher degrees of freedom and guard against p-hacking and HARKing. Modifying it *after* seeing the data, particularly to change key analytical decisions, is a fundamental breach of research integrity. The likelihood of this happening without misconduct is very low (5%).\n*   **Unusual P-value Distribution (high concentration just below .05, almost none above):** This is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking. It strongly suggests that analyses were continued, tweaked, or selectively reported until a statistically significant result was achieved, or that non-significant results were discarded. The likelihood of this occurring by chance without misconduct is extremely low (5%).\n*   **Emails Expressing Intense Pressure and Desire for Specific Results:** Lena's statements (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") reveal a clear and compelling motivation for committing misconduct. While these pressures are common in academia, they provide a strong psychological context for why someone might cross an ethical line.\n*   **Whistleblower Claim of \"Too Perfect\" Data:** This anonymous claim is consistent with results that have been statistically massaged to achieve clean, strong effects.\n*   **Earlier Analysis Script with More Participants:** While this can have innocent explanations, it is also consistent with selectively excluding participants after observing their impact on the results (a form of p-hacking), especially in light of the retroactively changed exclusion criteria in the preregistration.\n\n**Mitigating Evidence (Less Conclusive Against Misconduct):**\n\n*   **Strong Prior Record:** Lena's previous studies were well-documented and reproducible, passing an independent audit. This suggests she is capable of ethical research. However, it doesn't preclude a *first-time* lapse in judgment or intentional misconduct under extreme, unique pressure, as described in her emails.\n*   **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure:** These are plausible, mundane reasons for some missing files or irregularities. However, they do not explain the post-hoc preregistration changes or the anomalous p-value distribution. They might provide a *cover* or *excuse* for some issues, but not the core indicators of misconduct.\n*   **Lab-Wide Push to Explore Robustness (multiple alternative scripts):** While exploring robustness is a legitimate practice, it can also provide cover for p-hacking. If a researcher runs many variations, they can claim to be \"exploring robustness\" while in fact selecting the analysis that yields the desired p-value.\n*   **Legitimate Exclusions for Asleep/Confused Participants:** This demonstrates that Lena did apply some proper data quality checks. However, misconduct often isn't universal; researchers may still follow basic good practices even while engaging in more targeted manipulation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence for intentional misconduct is compelling and multifaceted. The combination of a retroactively modified preregistration document (changing primary outcomes and exclusion criteria), a p-value distribution that is a clear hallmark of p-hacking, and strong explicit motivations (fear of career impact, supervisor pressure) forms a very strong case. While Lena's prior good record and some mundane explanations for minor data issues provide some counterpoints, they do not adequately explain the most critical and problematic pieces of evidence. The statistical pattern and the preregistration changes are highly unlikely to be \"honest mistakes or miscommunication\" given their nature.\n\n95"
