The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a highly problematic action that directly undermines the purpose of preregistration. The core aim of preregistration is to establish a transparent, unchangeable plan *before* data collection and analysis, thereby preventing \"p-hacking,\" \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known), and selective reporting, all of which are forms of academic misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies that any irregularities are due to \"honest mistakes or miscommunication,\" and that she did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data or the research record.\n\nLet's consider possible \"innocent\" explanations for modifying the preregistration document post-data collection:\n\n1.  **Profound Misunderstanding of Preregistration:** Lena might have genuinely misunderstood the fundamental principle of preregistration, viewing it as a \"living document\" that can be updated to reflect the *final* experimental plan or \"tidied up\" for publication, even if the final plan evolved after data collection. In this scenario, she might not *intend* to deceive but is acting under a severe misconception of research integrity. However, changing \"primary outcomes\" and \"exclusion criteria\" are substantive changes, not minor corrections, and are almost always driven by a desire to align the documented plan with favorable, *post-hoc* results.\n2.  **Administrative Error/Platform Glitch:** It's conceivable, though highly unlikely, that an administrative error (e.g., uploading the wrong document version) or a critical flaw in a preregistration platform allowed the original document to be silently overwritten with a revised version without an audit trail, and Lena did not realize the implications or was attempting a transparent amendment that went wrong. This is a very weak explanation, as most platforms are designed to prevent such silent overwrites for critical documents.\n3.  **Supervisor Instruction (without Lena's intent to deceive):** Professor Mills, under pressure, might have instructed Lena to \"adjust\" the preregistration to better align with the publishable findings, and Lena followed the instruction without realizing the ethical implications or without personally intending to commit fraud. While this might shift some culpability to the supervisor, Lena's *action* of modifying the document still contributes to the falsification of the research record.\n\nEven under the most charitable interpretations, modifying a preregistration document to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria *after* data collection, particularly when the resulting paper reports \"strong, statistically significant\" findings, is almost universally regarded as a form of falsification of the research record. It misrepresents the original intent and design of the study.\n\nThe description states that Lena has a \"previously strong record of careful data handling,\" which would argue *against* her making such a fundamental and ethically blind mistake regarding research integrity. Someone careful with data would likely be aware of the importance of an unalterable preregistration.\n\nFor this action to occur *without* Lena committing academic misconduct (i.e., without intentional falsification of the research record or intent to deceive), it would require an extraordinary level of misunderstanding or an unprecedented technical error, where Lena truly believed her actions were permissible and did not intend to misrepresent the study's pre-planned nature. This stretches the definition of an \"honest mistake\" to its absolute limit, as the act itself creates a deceptive record.\n\nGiven that modifying primary outcomes and exclusion criteria post-data collection is one of the most direct ways to introduce bias and misrepresent findings, it is exceedingly unlikely to occur if the researcher genuinely did not intend to commit academic misconduct.\n\n1"

This particular act is a classic maneuver associated with various forms of research misconduct, specifically falsification of the research record, p-hacking, and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n\nHere's why it aligns with academic misconduct:\n\n1.  **Justifying Post-Hoc Decisions:** If initial analyses did not yield the desired statistically significant results, a researcher engaged in misconduct might explore various analytical paths, change exclusion criteria, or redefine outcomes until a \"publishable\" result emerges. Modifying the preregistration document retrospectively serves to create a false impression that these data-driven decisions were, in fact, pre-planned. This is a direct attempt to legitimize selectively chosen results.\n2.  **Achieving \"Perfect\" Results:** The fact that the paper reports \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results\" after such a modification is highly suspicious. If the original planned outcomes or exclusion criteria did not produce these results, changing them after data collection would be a deliberate step to \"optimize\" the findings for publication.\n3.  **Responding to Pressure:** Professor Mills' pressure for \"publishable findings\" provides a strong motive for Lena to engage in such practices if she were to commit misconduct. Modifying the preregistration would be a direct way to ensure the reported findings align with what is \"publishable\" by retrospectively adjusting the study plan to fit the data.\n4.  **Covering Up Bias:** Preregistration's primary purpose is to combat researcher bias and selective reporting. Undermining it by changing core elements (exclusion criteria, primary outcomes) post-data collection directly negates this purpose and suggests an intent to mislead about the study's original design and analytical plan.\n\nIn essence, modifying a preregistration document post-data collection to alter key study parameters is not merely a tangential detail; it is a direct method by which academic misconduct, particularly selective reporting and falsification of the research record, is executed or concealed. It serves to create a false narrative that the reported results were found according to a pre-established, unbiased plan, when in reality, the plan was changed to fit the desired outcome.\n\n95"

    "content": "The described pattern of p-values—an unusually high concentration just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05—is a classic signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. These practices fall under the umbrella of academic misconduct, as they involve distorting the true statistical evidence to achieve publishable results.\n\nIf Lena did *not* commit academic misconduct, meaning she did not intentionally manipulate data or analyses, or selectively report results to achieve significance, it would be *extremely* unlikely for this specific pattern to emerge.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Chance/Random Variation:** Under the null hypothesis (i.e., no true effect), p-values are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means you are just as likely to get a p-value between .04 and .05 as you are between .05 and .06. For *several* exploratory analyses to independently land just below .05, while almost none land just above, purely by chance, is a statistically improbable coincidence.\n2.  **Genuine Effect:** If there were genuine effects, one might expect many p-values below .05. However, there would be no *natural* reason for them to cluster exclusively *just* below .05, with a sudden drop-off directly above. A true effect would typically yield a broader distribution, some very low, some moderately low, and some potentially non-significant, without such a sharp artificial boundary at the conventional alpha level.\n3.  **Honest Mistakes:** \"Honest mistakes\" (e.g., calculation errors, miscoding) generally introduce random errors. They are highly unlikely to systematically shift multiple p-values specifically to just below the .05 threshold while avoiding the region just above it. An honest mistake might make a significant p-value non-significant, or vice-versa, but it wouldn't create this specific concentrated pattern.\n\nThis pattern is almost exclusively associated with researcher degrees of freedom being exercised to achieve statistical significance. If Lena were truly free of misconduct (meaning no intentional p-hacking, HARKing, or selective reporting), this pattern would be an astonishing statistical anomaly.\n\n1"

When a researcher engages in such practices, they might:\n1.  **Run multiple analyses:** Explore various statistical models, exclusion criteria, or variable transformations until a significant result emerges.\n2.  **Stop at significance:** Cease further analysis or data collection once a p-value falls below the conventional .05 threshold.\n3.  **Selectively report:** Choose to only report analyses that yielded significant p-values, particularly those that are close to the threshold.\n4.  **Minor manipulations:** In some extreme cases, minor (and unethical) data adjustments or rounding might be employed to push a p-value just below .05.\n\nThe goal of these behaviors, often driven by publication pressure or a desire to support a specific hypothesis, is to achieve statistically significant findings. Therefore, if a researcher is actively trying to \"find\" or \"create\" significance, the results will often cluster just below the chosen alpha level (e.g., .05), with a conspicuous absence of values just above it, because those non-significant results would either be discarded or further manipulated until they crossed the threshold.\n\nThis pattern is not expected to occur naturally due to genuine effects or random chance, making its presence a strong indicator of intentional manipulation or selective reporting.\n\n95"

Supervisors often rely on successful grant applications to fund their labs and maintain their research programs. PhD students are under immense pressure to produce publishable results to secure postdocs, tenure-track positions, and establish their careers. These are common and widely acknowledged realities of academic life.\n2.  **Natural Desire for Success:** Any researcher, ethical or not, invests significant time, effort, and intellectual capital into their studies. It is entirely natural to hope that their hypothesis is supported, that the experiment \"works,\" and that their efforts lead to significant, publishable findings. Wanting a study to \"work\" is not inherently unethical; it's a reflection of personal investment and belief in one's research.\n3.  **Impact of Results on Career:** A \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory\" can genuinely make or break a PhD student's career prospects. A null result, particularly for a major project, can indeed make it more challenging to publish in top journals and secure competitive postdoctoral positions. Lena's concern about her postdoc chances is a realistic assessment of the academic landscape.\n4.  **Expressing Vulnerability to a Friend:** Emails to a friend are typically a space for honest, unvarnished expression of feelings, fears, and pressures. Lena's words reflect the very real anxieties and hopes that many researchers experience, particularly when a significant project is on the line. These emails reveal the *motive* for potential misconduct, but they do not *constitute* misconduct in themselves. An ethical researcher can feel all this pressure and desire for a positive outcome, but still adhere strictly to scientific integrity in their actual research practices.\n\nTherefore, these emails reflect common sentiments and pressures experienced by researchers, and their content alone does not indicate academic misconduct.\n\n85"

These emails lay bare the intense stakes involved for Lena.\n2.  **Rationalization/Context:** If Lena chose to manipulate data or analyses, these emails provide a clear window into her state of mind and the perceived necessity of her actions.

Participants are commonly excluded for legitimate reasons such as:\n    *   Failing attention checks or comprehension questions.\n    *   Providing incomplete data.\n    *   Technical issues during data collection (e.g., equipment malfunction).\n    *   Not meeting pre-defined demographic or behavioral criteria.\n    *   Having extreme outliers that genuinely reflect non-compliance or unusual data rather than true psychological phenomena.\n2.  **Iterative Analysis Development:** Researchers often develop and refine their analysis scripts iteratively. An early version might be used for initial data inspection or preliminary runs on the full collected sample before final exclusion criteria are fully applied or before final decisions about data quality are made.\n3.  **Honest Mistakes/Refinement of Criteria:** Even without intentional misconduct, a researcher might initially include participants and only later (during the data cleaning phase) realize that certain exclusion criteria apply, or they might refine the exact operationalization of an exclusion criterion (e.g., deciding on a specific threshold for response times). If these exclusions are applied consistently and transparently, they are legitimate.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants than the final dataset is a completely normal outcome of the data cleaning and processing pipeline in scientific research. The critical factor for determining misconduct is *why* participants were excluded, not the mere fact that some were. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it implies that any exclusions were based on legitimate reasons, even if the documentation (like the preregistration) might have been handled imperfectly or retrospectively.\n\n90"

If Lena was trying to achieve \"clean\" and statistically significant results (especially given the pressure from her supervisor and for her postdoc), she might review the data and identify participants whose responses make the overall pattern less compelling or whose data points push a p-value above .05. Excluding these \"problematic\" participants would then \"improve\" the results.\n2.  **Retrospective Justification:** The modification of the preregistration document *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria further supports this. If Lena committed misconduct, she might have initially collected data from all participants, run preliminary analyses, identified which participants' data were \"unhelpful,\" and then retroactively changed the exclusion criteria in the preregistration to justify their removal. The earlier script would then reflect the original, larger sample before these advantageous exclusions were made.\n3.  **Hiding the Process:** An earlier script containing more participants simply represents the starting point *before* such selective exclusions were implemented. Its existence doesn't necessarily prove misconduct, but if misconduct occurred, it's a very plausible scenario that Lena started with a larger dataset and then strategically culled participants to achieve her desired outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the presence of an earlier script with more participants, compared to a final dataset with fewer, is very consistent with the actions a researcher might take if they were engaged in academic misconduct to manipulate results.\n\n90"

There are numerous legitimate reasons for such a switch:\n    *   A new, more powerful, or user-friendly software becomes available.\n    *   The previous software's license expires or becomes too expensive.\n    *   A new lab member or collaborator introduces a different preferred software.\n    *   The supervisor decides to standardize tools across projects or with other collaborating labs.\n    *   Specific analyses required by the project later on are better supported by the new software.\n    Such a transition can certainly introduce complexities, inconsistencies in file formats, or require re-learning, but it is not inherently indicative of misconduct.\n\n2.  **Lena's laptop hard drive failure leading to missing files, confirmed by IT:** Hard drive failures are an unfortunately common technical issue with electronic devices. The fact that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure and repair significantly bolsters its credibility as a genuine technical problem, rather than a fabricated excuse. Losing files due to a hard drive failure, especially if backup practices were not perfectly rigorous or up-to-date (which is also not uncommon, even among diligent researchers), is a direct and plausible consequence.\n\nThe co-occurrence of these two events, while inconvenient for data management and reproducibility, is not statistically improbable in a typical research environment over the course of a multi-year PhD project. They represent \"mundane explanations\" for potential irregularities, as stated in the inquiry. If Lena is not committing misconduct, these are simply unfortunate circumstances that contribute to a messy data trail, making it harder to perfectly reconstruct every step, but not due to any intentional wrongdoing on her part.\n\nGiven that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure, it lends significant weight to this being a genuine external event rather than a convenient fabrication to explain away missing data.\n\n80"

This is a common operational decision for a research group and is generally independent of any individual researcher's ethical conduct.\n2.  **Lena's laptop hard drive failure leading to missing files:** Hard drive failures are unfortunate but common technical incidents. The fact that the IT department *confirmed* the hardware failure and repair around that time strongly indicates it was a genuine event, not a fabricated excuse. Losing some files, especially recent ones not yet backed up or synced, is a plausible consequence of such a failure, regardless of whether the user is engaged in misconduct.\n\nTherefore, whether Lena committed academic misconduct or not does not significantly alter the probability of these technical and administrative events occurring. They are \"mundane explanations\" in the sense that they can happen to anyone in research.

For example, a 50% chance of a software switch and a 40% chance of a hard drive failure with some data loss over 3-4 years would lead to a joint probability of around 20% (0.5 * 0.4).

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that the lab's data management logs would still show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **P-hacking and HARKing Strategies:** A researcher engaged in academic misconduct, particularly p-hacking (running multiple analyses until a desired p-value is achieved) or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known, which often involves exploring data and then framing the hypothesis retrospectively), would inherently generate many different analysis scripts. They would be trying various combinations of variables, models, and exclusion criteria to find a statistically significant result.\n2.  **Plausible Deniability/Cover:** The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" provides a perfect cover for a researcher committing misconduct. Lena could claim that she was simply following lab protocol by exploring different analytical paths and robustness checks, while her actual intent was to cherry-pick or manipulate results. Storing all scripts (even the \"failed\" ones or those that led to non-significant findings) would make her process appear transparent and rigorous, even if she ultimately only reported the \"successful\" outcomes or retroactively modified her preregistration to align with them.\n3.  **Lab Culture and Data Management:** If it's a \"lab-wide push\" and \"other students show similar patterns,\" it suggests that the lab has a culture or a system for managing and storing these various exploratory analyses. Even a researcher engaged in misconduct would likely adhere to lab-wide data management practices to avoid drawing suspicion to themselves.\n\nTherefore, the existence of multiple scripts with varied exclusion criteria, stored in the lab's logs and mirroring the practices of other students, is entirely consistent with (and potentially even facilitated by) Lena committing academic misconduct. It provides a means to perform the misconduct while simultaneously creating an appearance of diligent and transparent research.\n\n90"

    "content": "It is extremely likely that if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Direct Evidence of Good Practice:** The information provided directly states that she has \"no prior record of data irregularities\" and that her previous projects \"passed an independent data audit.\" An independent data audit specifically aims to verify the integrity, accuracy, and proper documentation of research data. Passing such an audit is definitive proof of adherence to high standards.\n2.  **Explicit Endorsement of Reproducibility:** The rating of her raw data and scripts as \"well-documented and reproducible\" is a direct affirmation of her commitment to transparency and scientific rigor. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of ethical and sound scientific practice, and a lack of misconduct is fundamentally aligned with these qualities.\n3.  **Consistency with \"No Misconduct\":** If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it means she conducted her research with integrity, diligence, and adherence to ethical guidelines. These qualities are precisely what would lead to a clean audit record and well-documented, reproducible work. There would be no reason for irregularities or poor documentation if she were acting ethically.\n\nThis evidence strongly supports Lena's integrity in her prior work and serves as a baseline for her competence and ethical approach to research.\n\n99"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, it is still moderately to highly likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **First-Time Offender Scenario:** Many individuals who commit academic misconduct (or any form of fraud) do so as a first transgression, often under specific, intense pressure. The current study clearly presents such pressure (grant review, postdoc chances). In this scenario, Lena's previous work would genuinely reflect her diligent and ethical approach to research, explaining the clean audit and excellent ratings. Her misconduct would be a deviation from her past behavior.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Integrity:** Even a researcher inclined to misconduct might be meticulous in other aspects of their work, especially if they know their work might be audited. A clean record for previous studies could also be a strategic outcome of Lena being very careful in the past to avoid detection or ensuring that earlier, lower-stakes projects were impeccably documented.\n3.  **Audits are Not Infallible:** While independent audits are designed to detect irregularities, not all forms of misconduct are easily caught. However, the rating of \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggests a high standard of scrutiny was applied, making it less likely that *significant* misconduct went undetected in previous audits. This leans back towards the first-time offender scenario being more probable if misconduct is indeed present now.\n\nTherefore, a clean prior record does not necessarily negate the possibility of current misconduct. Instead, it suggests that if misconduct occurred, it might be a new or escalated behavior rather than a consistent pattern throughout her academic career.\n\n75"

    "content": "The evidence strongly points towards academic misconduct. The key pieces of evidence that are extremely difficult to explain without intentional misconduct are:\n\n1.  **Modification of the preregistration document *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:** This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a classic way to retrospectively justify analysis choices made after seeing the data, often to achieve significant results. This is a clear act of falsification of the research record.\n2.  **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with almost no p-values just above .05 for *several exploratory analyses*:** This is a textbook signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It is statistically highly improbable to occur by chance and is a strong indicator that analyses were run, parameters were adjusted, or results were selectively reported to achieve significance.\n\nWhile there are \"mundane explanations\" and factors that might argue against consistent misconduct:\n\n*   **Mundane Explanations:** The lab software switch and hard drive failure can explain *some* missing files or inconsistencies in the data trail, but they do *not* explain the systematic pattern in p-values or the post-hoc change to the preregistration.\n*   **Strong Record:** Lena's previously strong record, independent audit, and well-documented past work suggest a capacity for ethical research. However, people can and do commit misconduct for the first time, often under immense pressure.\n*   **Legitimate Exclusions:** The exclusion of two participants based on clear, pre-submission notes shows some good practice, but this doesn't negate the suspicious nature of other data exclusions or analysis choices implied by the p-value distribution and preregistration change.\n*   **Multiple Scripts:** The lab-wide push for robustness and Lena running multiple scripts is ambiguous. While good practice in principle, it also provides a convenient cover for p-hacking if the intent was to find and report only significant results, as indicated by the p-value distribution.\n\nThe combination of a falsified preregistration document and the highly improbable p-value distribution constitutes overwhelming evidence of intentional manipulation of the research process and results. The strong pressure Lena felt, as expressed in her emails, provides a clear motive. While her past record suggests this might be an isolated incident driven by current pressure, it does not diminish the likelihood that these specific, highly problematic actions in *this* study constitute misconduct.\n\n95"
