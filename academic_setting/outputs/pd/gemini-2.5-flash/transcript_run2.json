The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here's why:\n\n1.  **Academic Pressure is Real:** The academic environment, particularly for PhD students, is intensely competitive and driven by the need for publications and grant funding. Professor Mills's reliance on the study for a grant review is a common scenario, creating legitimate pressure on Lena.\n2.  **Career Stakes are High:** Securing a postdoc position often hinges on a strong publication record. A \"null result\" (meaning the hypothesis was not supported) can indeed make it harder to publish in top journals and thus negatively impact career prospects. Lena's concern about her postdoc chances is a very realistic and common anxiety among PhD students.\n3.  **Desire for Success is Natural:** The phrase \"I need this one to work\" expresses a strong desire for the experiment to yield the predicted, publishable results. This is a natural human emotion for anyone deeply invested in their research, especially when under significant pressure. It reflects hope and ambition, not necessarily an intent to falsify data. An honest scientist still hopes their hypothesis will be supported and their efforts will lead to clear, impactful findings.\n4.  **Private Communication:** These emails were written to a friend, suggesting they were a private outlet for expressing genuine feelings of stress, ambition, and the external pressures she was facing. People often articulate their deepest anxieties and desires more openly in such contexts.\n\nIn summary, these statements reflect the inherent pressures, anxieties, and aspirations common to many PhD students in high-stakes research environments. Feeling and expressing such sentiments is entirely consistent with being an ethical researcher who is genuinely trying to achieve scientific success, without resorting to misconduct. The desire for a particular outcome is distinct from the act of manipulating data to achieve it.\n\n95"

If she *did* commit misconduct, these emails articulate the very reasons or intense pressures that might have led her down that path.\n2.  **Internal Rationalization/Expression of Pressure:** Even if she committed misconduct, these feelings are genuine expressions of the immense pressure and stakes involved. It's not uncommon for individuals under such stress to articulate their desperation and the high stakes in private communications, regardless of whether they ultimately act unethically. The act of expressing these feelings could even be seen as part of the internal process that might lead to or accompany misconduct.\n3.  **Consistency with the Act:** The desire for the study to \"work\" and the fear of negative career consequences are perfectly consistent with the desperate decision to manipulate data to achieve those desired outcomes. Therefore, expressing these sentiments in private emails would be a natural manifestation of the mindset that might precede or accompany such actions.\n\nIn essence, these emails describe the powerful underlying pressures and desires that could *cause* someone to commit academic misconduct.

Modifying key elements like primary outcomes and exclusion criteria *after* data has been collected (and potentially analyzed) fundamentally undermines the integrity and purpose of preregistration. It opens the door to \"p-hacking\" or \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known), where analysis plans are adjusted to fit observed data, potentially inflating the likelihood of finding statistically significant results.\n2.  **Strong Indicator of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** Even if not intended as outright \"fraud\" or \"fabrication\" of data, such an action is widely considered a serious questionable research practice. Researchers who adhere to ethical standards and understand the principles of preregistration would know not to make such substantive changes post-data collection without transparently acknowledging them as post-hoc in the final publication, rather than altering the original preregistration document.\n3.  **Explaining it without Misconduct:** For this to occur without *intentional* misconduct, it would require a profound misunderstanding of research ethics and the strictures of preregistration, or severe pressure from a supervisor who himself is engaging in QRPs without Lena fully realizing the ethical implications. For instance, Lena might have genuinely believed she was \"correcting\" an oversight or \"refining\" the plan under guidance, not understanding that doing so *after* data collection fundamentally biases the reported results. While such ignorance or undue influence is possible, it's not a common or justifiable \"honest mistake\" when it pertains to such critical study parameters.\n\nGiven the severity of changing primary outcomes and exclusion criteria post-data collection, it's an action highly indicative of an attempt to achieve desired results rather than a genuine, unintentional error in an otherwise clean study. While an extremely rare combination of ignorance and circumstance could theoretically lead to this without direct intent to defraud, it is highly improbable for an ethical researcher, especially a third-year PhD student who should have a foundational understanding of research methodology.\n\n15"

If Lena was intentionally manipulating data or results, adjusting these parameters post-hoc is a direct way to \"p-hack\" her way to a desired outcome. For example, by changing exclusion criteria, she could remove participants whose data weakened the effect; by changing primary outcomes, she could select an outcome measure that happened to show significance.\n2.  **Covering Up Post-Hoc Decisions:** The act of modifying the *preregistration document itself* (rather than transparently reporting post-hoc changes in the manuscript) serves to make these data-driven decisions appear as if they were pre-planned. This deceptive act is a hallmark of academic misconduct, as it misrepresents the scientific process and aims to conceal that the analyses were adapted to fit the data.\n3.  **Alignment with Motive:** Lena's stated pressure (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") provides a strong motive for engaging in such manipulative practices if she indeed committed misconduct. Changing the preregistration document would be a strategic move to ensure the study \"works\" and appears robust, aligning with her desperation for positive, publishable findings.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, altering the preregistration document in this manner would be a very logical and effective (though unethical) step towards achieving her goals and concealing her methods.\n\n98"

These criteria can include:\n    *   **Technical issues:** Participants whose data were corrupted, incomplete, or affected by equipment malfunction.\n    *   **Non-compliance:** Participants who did not follow instructions, failed attention checks, or exhibited problematic behavior (e.g., excessive movement in an fMRI scanner).\n    *   **Outliers:** Participants whose performance or physiological data fall outside predefined statistical ranges.\n    *   **Demographic criteria:** Participants who, upon closer inspection, do not meet specific age, health, or other demographic requirements.\n    *   **Data quality issues:** Any other legitimate reason to believe a participant's data is unreliable or invalid for analysis.\n\n2.  **Iterative Script Development:** Analysis scripts are often developed iteratively. An early version might simply load all raw data, while later versions incorporate the specific exclusion rules and data cleaning steps that are applied to arrive at the final dataset. The \"earlier version\" recovered from a backup might represent a point *before* all planned (or subsequently identified and justified) exclusions were implemented.\n\n3.  **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** Sometimes, even with preregistration, researchers might discover during preliminary data inspection or analysis that new, justifiable exclusion criteria need to be applied (e.g., realizing a specific noise level in fMRI data makes some scans unusable). If these are applied transparently and justified in the final paper, it's considered good practice, not misconduct.\n\nIn summary, the presence of an earlier script with more participants is a very common and expected part of the data processing pipeline in legitimate research. It reflects the process of moving from raw collected data to a final, cleaned, and analyzed dataset.\n\n95"

If Lena was trying to achieve a specific statistically significant result to \"save the grant\" and secure her postdoc, removing inconvenient data points would be a very direct and effective way to do so. An earlier script would naturally reflect the dataset *before* these strategic exclusions were made.\n2.  **Covering Up the Act:** The presence of an earlier script with more participants, compared to a later script with fewer, could be evidence of this selective exclusion. If she committed misconduct, she would likely make these exclusions, and the difference between the scripts would simply document her actions.\n3.  **Coexistence with Other Misconduct:** Even if Lena's primary misconduct involved something else (e.g., fabricating data points, modifying outcomes), the general process of data cleaning and exclusion still occurs in research. Therefore, an earlier script might contain more participants due to standard, legitimate data cleaning, *in addition to* any other misconduct she might have committed. However, given the context of manipulating results for significance, strategic exclusion is a particularly potent form of misconduct.\n\nIn summary, if Lena committed misconduct, the act of excluding participants is a plausible way for her to achieve desired results. An earlier script showing the full participant pool before such exclusions would be entirely consistent with this scenario.\n\n95"

The description \"unusually high concentration... just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting/analysis choices.\n2.  **Hallmark of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** This specific pattern is one of the strongest statistical indicators that researchers have engaged in some form of data dredging, flexible data analysis, or selective reporting to achieve significance. While QRPs are sometimes distinguished from outright fraud, this particular pattern is rarely, if ever, a natural outcome of an unbiased analysis process.\n3.  **\"Exploratory Analyses\":** While exploratory analyses inherently involve more flexibility than confirmatory ones, even in exploration, the expectation is to report what is found. Systematically finding significance *just below* the threshold while *never* finding it *just above* is highly suspicious.\n4.  **Unlikely Coincidence:** For this to occur without misconduct, it would require an extraordinary coincidence where all legitimate variations in analysis (e.g., slight adjustments to models, covariates, or exclusions) consistently happened to push p-values from insignificance into marginal significance, and never the other way around, across multiple analyses. This is statistically improbable.\n\nTherefore, while \"not committing academic misconduct\" can technically include profound incompetence or extreme naivety, this specific pattern is so characteristic of intentional manipulation to achieve desired results that its occurrence without such intent is highly unlikely.\n\n2"

When initial analyses do not yield the desired p < .05, a researcher inclined towards misconduct would make various data-driven choices (e.g., running multiple analyses, selectively excluding participants, transforming variables, adding/removing covariates, or even slightly altering data points) specifically designed to push marginal p-values across the .05 threshold.\n3.  **Hiding Null Results:** The absence of p-values just above .05 further supports this, as any analyses yielding p-values slightly above the threshold would likely be either adjusted until they dipped below, or simply not reported (selective reporting), unless they were clearly non-significant and could not be \"rescued.\"\n4.  **Alignment with Motive:** Given Lena's stated pressure (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"), this specific pattern is a direct manifestation of attempts to force the data to \"work\" and produce publishable findings.\n\nTherefore, this pattern is not just consistent with academic misconduct; it's a very common and expected outcome of the specific types of manipulation a researcher might employ when under pressure to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n99"

Lab-wide software changes happen for various administrative, technical, or cost-related reasons, regardless of a single researcher's actions. Similarly, hardware failures are unpredictable technical issues that can affect anyone's equipment, as confirmed by the IT department in this case.\n2.  **Plausible External Factors:** These are common, \"mundane explanations\" for irregularities or missing files in a research project.

Many other parts of their research process, including basic data collection, quality control, and participant tracking, may still be performed legitimately.\n2.  **Obvious and Legitimate Exclusions:** Participants falling asleep or not understanding instructions are clear, objective, and universally accepted reasons for exclusion in research. Even a researcher who intends to commit misconduct would likely exclude such participants, as their data would be genuinely unusable and including them might even dilute desired effects or be difficult to explain if scrutinized.\n3.  **Basic Data Management:** Recording notes on participant behavior or issues (like falling asleep) in raw data files is a fundamental aspect of good data management. This practice would likely be ingrained regardless of a researcher's later ethical lapses. The timing (\"predate any journal submission\") reinforces this as an initial data processing step.\n4.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** Having genuinely documented and justifiable exclusions like these can contribute to an overall appearance of careful and ethical data handling, which could even serve to mask other, less legitimate actions if Lena were committing misconduct.\n\nTherefore, the presence of these well-documented, legitimate exclusions is entirely consistent with a scenario where other forms of academic misconduct might also be occurring.

This indicates that systematically testing how results hold up under different analytical choices (including varying exclusion criteria) is a standard and encouraged practice within this lab. Exploring robustness is a highly commendable scientific practice aimed at ensuring that findings are not artifacts of arbitrary analytical decisions.\n2.  **Best Practices in Modern Science:** In contemporary research, transparency and robustness checks are increasingly emphasized. Researchers are encouraged to demonstrate that their findings are not sensitive to minor changes in analysis plans, such as slightly different exclusion criteria. Running multiple scripts to test these sensitivities is a legitimate way to do this.\n3.  **Consistency Across Students:** The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" strongly suggests that this is a standard operating procedure or a shared methodological philosophy within Professor Mills's lab, rather than an unusual or suspicious behavior specific to Lena.\n4.  **Evidence of Diligence, Not Misconduct:** If Lena is an honest researcher, this pattern of saving multiple analysis scripts with varying parameters (both stricter and looser) is evidence of thoroughness and a commitment to understanding the nuances of her data, not misconduct. It's about fully exploring the data space rather than fishing for a particular result.\n\nThis scenario describes a legitimate and often praised approach to data analysis in modern science, especially when explicitly driven by a lab-wide initiative for robustness.\n\n98"

    "content": "It is extremely likely that the lab's data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, even if she did commit academic misconduct.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Lab-wide Policy/Culture:** The key detail is \"a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\" This indicates that running multiple analysis scripts with varying parameters is a standard, expected, and documented practice within Professor Mills's lab. Regardless of Lena's individual ethical choices, she would be expected to conform to lab norms and practices.\n2.  **Opportunity for P-Hacking:** While exploring robustness is a legitimate scientific practice, it can also be exploited by researchers engaged in questionable research practices (QRPs) or outright misconduct. Running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria, and then *selectively reporting* only those that yield significant results, is a classic form of \"p-hacking.\" So, if Lena were committing misconduct, she would still be running these scripts, but with the *intent* of finding the combination that produces the desired outcome, and potentially not fully transparently reporting all the alternatives.\n3.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A researcher engaging in misconduct often tries to make their actions appear legitimate. Following established lab protocols, such as running robustness checks and saving the scripts, would contribute to an appearance of diligence and good scientific practice, potentially masking the selective reporting or manipulation that might occur in the *selection* of the \"final\" results.\n\nTherefore, the mere act of running and storing these scripts is consistent with both ethical practice (as part of a robustness push) and a scenario where misconduct might be occurring (using the robustness push as a vehicle for p-hacking or selective reporting). The existence of the scripts themselves is highly probable under either scenario, given the lab's stated policy.\n\n99"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence and the likelihood judgments provided for each scenario:\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence strongly point towards academic misconduct:\n\n*   **Preregistration Modified Post-Data Collection (Primary Outcomes & Exclusion Criteria):** This is a critical piece of evidence. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this happening is extremely low (15%). If she did commit misconduct, the likelihood is very high (98%). This suggests a deliberate attempt to manipulate the reported study design to fit the results.\n*   **Unusual P-value Distribution (Concentrated just below .05, few above):** This is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting/analysis. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this pattern occurring naturally is extremely low (2%). If she did commit misconduct, the likelihood is extremely high (99%). This is a very strong indicator of intentional manipulation.\n*   **Motive Emails:** While these emails are highly likely whether or not she committed misconduct (95% vs 98%), they clearly establish a strong motive for misconduct due to immense career and grant pressure.\n\nOther pieces of evidence are less discriminatory, or even lean against misconduct, but do not sufficiently counter the strong indicators above:\n\n*   **Earlier script with more participants, later excluded:** This is highly likely in both scenarios (95% for both), representing either normal data cleaning or strategic exclusion.\n*   **Software switch & hard drive failure:** These are highly likely independent events in both scenarios (95% for both), providing plausible mundane explanations for missing files but not directly indicating or disproving misconduct regarding the specific study results.\n*   **Legitimate exclusions with predating notes:** This is highly likely in both scenarios (98% vs 95%). This demonstrates some legitimate data handling practices, which could occur even if other misconduct was present, or could be a deliberate act to appear credible.\n*   **Strong prior record:** This is very likely if she did not commit misconduct (99%) and moderately likely if she did (70%). While this is the strongest piece of evidence *against* misconduct, it doesn't preclude a single instance of misconduct under extreme pressure. People can act unethically in high-stakes situations even with a previously clean record.\n*   **Lab-wide robustness push (multiple scripts):** This is highly likely in both scenarios (98% vs 99%). While an ethical practice, it also provides an environment where p-hacking could occur by selectively reporting the \"robust\" findings that happen to be significant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence of the modified preregistration document *after* data collection and, especially, the statistically improbable distribution of p-values, are extremely strong indicators of intentional manipulation to achieve statistically significant results. These are fundamental breaches of scientific integrity that are highly unlikely to occur without misconduct. While her past record is strong and some issues have mundane explanations, these do not explain away the two most damning pieces of evidence. The intense pressure Lena felt provides a clear motive.\n\nConsidering the cumulative weight, particularly the almost impossible likelihood of the p-value distribution and post-hoc preregistration changes occurring without misconduct, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is very high.\n\n93"
