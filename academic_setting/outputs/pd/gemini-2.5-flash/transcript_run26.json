The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct (meaning she did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data), the likelihood of her modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is very low.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Purpose of Preregistration:** Preregistration's primary goal is to prevent practices like p-hacking (adjusting analyses or criteria to find significant results) and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). Modifying core elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes *after* data collection fundamentally undermines this purpose, as it creates the opportunity to tailor the methodology to already observed data.\n\n2.  **Implications of Such Changes:** Changing exclusion criteria can alter the participant pool to yield more favorable results. Changing primary outcomes can shift focus to a variable that, by chance, showed a strong effect, even if it wasn't the original main hypothesis. These are precisely the types of manipulations preregistration aims to prevent.\n\n3.  **Lena's Profile (if innocent of misconduct):**\n    *   **Third-year PhD student:** By this stage, a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience is expected to have a solid understanding of research methodology and ethical best practices, including the immutable nature of preregistration for key analytical decisions post-data collection.\n    *   **\"Previously strong record of careful data handling\":** This suggests competence and adherence to procedural standards, making a fundamental misunderstanding of preregistration less likely.\n    *   **Insistence on \"honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud\":** This is Lena's defense, but the specific action of modifying preregistration for exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is generally considered a highly deliberate and consequential act.\n\n4.  **Potential \"Innocent\" Scenarios (if no intent to defraud):**\n    *   **Genuine error in the original preregistration:** Lena might have genuinely made a typo or an oversight in the original preregistration (e.g., a numerical threshold for an exclusion criterion was wrong, or a specific outcome variable was misnamed) and corrected it to reflect her *intended* original plan. However, for transparency, such a correction should ideally be made as a timestamped amendment, not a silent modification, and preferably *before* any data analysis is conducted. Doing it after data collection without transparent documentation immediately raises suspicion.\n    *   **Lack of understanding of preregistration rigor:** While less likely for a third-year PhD, it's conceivable that Lena genuinely did not understand the strict ethical implications of modifying a preregistration document for these specific elements after data collection. She might have viewed it as a \"living document\" or a protocol that can be refined. This would still be a severe lapse in research integrity and understanding, even if not driven by fraudulent intent.\n    *   **Supervisor's influence:** Professor Mills, under pressure, might have directed Lena to make these changes, framing them as \"refinements\" or \"clarifications,\" and Lena, trusting her supervisor or feeling unable to refuse, implemented them without personal intent to commit fraud. This scenario shifts some responsibility but still involves the act of modification by Lena.\n\nEven in these \"innocent\" scenarios, the act of modifying a preregistration for *exclusion criteria and primary outcomes* after data collection is a significant deviation from ethical research practice. It creates a strong appearance of misconduct and severely undermines the credibility of the research, regardless of intent. For this specific action to occur without *any* intent to manipulate results would require either a profound misunderstanding of research ethics (which is itself a serious professional failing) or an extremely unusual sequence of non-fraudulent events that coincidentally perfectly mimics fraudulent behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while not impossible, such an action occurring without *intentional* misconduct is highly improbable.\n\n20"

This allows them to present a positive, publishable result that appears to confirm a pre-specified hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Creating a Veneer of Legitimacy:** The purpose of preregistration is to demonstrate that a research plan was established *before* data collection and analysis, thereby increasing confidence in the reported findings. If misconduct has occurred through p-hacking or HARKing, retrospectively modifying the preregistration document allows the researcher to create a false record that aligns with the \"clean,\" significant results they are presenting. It attempts to make the manipulated process appear legitimate and pre-planned, even though the changes were made *after* seeing the data.\n\n3.  **Pressure to Publish:** The scenario states Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This external pressure can be a significant motivator for a researcher to engage in misconduct, and modifying preregistration is a tool to achieve those publishable findings when the original plan might not have yielded them.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, altering the preregistration document to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly serves the goals of generating \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and making the results \"look too perfect,\" while attempting to provide a fraudulent justification for the chosen analytical path.

This is a common and often necessary part of the research process, even in ethically sound studies.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Iterative Data Cleaning and Quality Control:** Researchers typically go through several stages of data processing. An early analysis script might be a preliminary pass that includes all raw data. Subsequent, more rigorous checks are then applied to identify issues such as:\n    *   **Poor task performance:** Participants who didn't understand instructions, responded randomly, or failed attention checks.\n    *   **Technical glitches:** Data corruption or incomplete data due to equipment malfunction during a specific participant's session.\n    *   **Protocol violations:** Participants who did not meet all inclusion criteria upon closer review (e.g., age, specific demographic, prior experience) or who violated experimental rules (e.g., guessing the hypothesis).\n    *   **Outliers:** Statistical outliers (e.g., extremely fast or slow response times) that might distort results and are legitimately removed using pre-specified or data-driven (but still justifiable) criteria.\n\n2.  **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** Even if the preregistration was modified after data collection (which is a problematic practice in itself, but *here we assume no misconduct*), if Lena is acting in good faith, she might have genuinely discovered new, legitimate reasons for exclusion during initial data exploration that were not fully anticipated or documented in the original preregistration. If she is not committing misconduct, these exclusions would be based on what she believes are valid scientific grounds for ensuring data quality, even if her process for updating the preregistration was flawed.\n\n3.  **Preliminary vs. Final Data Sets:** It's standard for researchers to work with a \"full\" or \"raw\" dataset initially and then refine it into a \"clean\" or \"final\" dataset for analysis after applying all necessary exclusion criteria. An earlier script might simply reflect the stage before these criteria were fully implemented.\n\nTherefore, the mere fact that an earlier script included more participants does not, by itself, indicate misconduct. It aligns with the normal progression of data processing and cleaning in scientific research. The ethical concern arises from *why* participants were excluded and *how* those decisions were documented (specifically the post-hoc preregistration modification), but the act of exclusion itself is routine.\n\n85"

If an initial analysis with a full or larger dataset doesn't yield the desired p-value or effect size, a researcher intending to commit misconduct might:\n    *   **Introduce or modify exclusion criteria retrospectively:** After seeing the data, they might identify participants whose data weaken the overall effect and then create or adjust criteria (e.g., stricter outlier definitions, performance thresholds) to justify their removal.\n    *   **Trial and error:** They might run analyses with different subsets of participants, excluding various groups until a favorable result emerges. The earlier script would then reflect an attempt before these \"optimizations\" were made.\n\n2.  **Consistency with Preregistration Modification:** The fact that the preregistration document was modified *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria strongly supports this. If Lena intended to commit misconduct, she would first identify which exclusions would benefit her results and *then* update the preregistration to provide a (false) legitimate justification for those exclusions. The earlier script would show the dataset *before* these strategically chosen exclusions were applied.\n\n3.  **Creating \"Clean\" Results:** The goal of misconduct in this scenario would be to produce \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and make the results \"look too perfect.\" Systematically excluding participants who introduce noise or contradict the hypothesis is an effective way to achieve this artificial \"perfection.\" The progression from a larger dataset to a smaller, \"cleaner\" one is a direct result of such manipulations.\n\nTherefore, the existence of an earlier script with more participants is not just plausible but highly probable if Lena engaged in intentional manipulation to achieve specific, publishable findings. It represents a tangible step in the process of shaping the data to fit a desired outcome.\n\n90"

If a true effect exists, p-values will tend to be lower. If there is no effect, p-values are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The idea that multiple independent analyses would coincidentally cluster their p-values *just* under the arbitrary .05 threshold, while almost entirely avoiding the region just above it, is statistically very improbable under normal circumstances.\n\n2.  **The \"P-Hacking Cliff\":** This specific pattern (a \"cliff\" at p=.05, with many values just below and almost none just above) is a well-known indicator of selective reporting, p-hacking, or other forms of data manipulation aimed at achieving statistical significance. If researchers run multiple analyses and only report those that cross the significance threshold (or tweak analyses until they do), this pattern emerges. If Lena is *not* committing misconduct, it means these results genuinely arose from the data without such intentional manipulation.\n\n3.  **Nature of Exploratory Analyses:** For \"several exploratory analyses,\" it is expected that some will yield significant results and some will not. If all effects are genuinely strong, many p-values might be very low (e.g., <.001). If some effects are weak or non-existent, p-values might be higher, including some just above .05. The precise clustering just below .05 for *several* such analyses, without any spilling over the threshold, is highly suspicious and not a natural outcome of ethical exploratory science.\n\nTherefore, while random chance can produce unusual results occasionally, the specified pattern across *multiple* exploratory analyses would be an extraordinary statistical coincidence if no misconduct occurred.\n\n5"

P-hacking refers to the practice of performing various analyses (e.g., trying different statistical tests, excluding different participants, adding covariates, transforming data) until a statistically significant result (typically p < .05) is achieved.\n\n2.  **Goal of Misconduct:** If Lena is committing academic misconduct, her primary goal is to produce \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and \"publishable findings\" to satisfy pressure from her supervisor. P-hacking is a direct and highly effective way to achieve this when the true effects are weak or non-existent.\n\n3.  **Mechanism:** A researcher engaging in p-hacking would:\n    *   Run multiple exploratory analyses.\n    *   Observe the p-values.\n    *   If a p-value is close to .05 but slightly above (e.g., .06, .07), they would then make small, often retrospectively justified, changes to the analysis (e.g., adjust exclusion criteria, add a covariate, remove an outlier) until that p-value dips just below .05.\n    *   Conversely, analyses yielding p-values far above .05 might simply be disregarded or not reported.\n\nThis selective reporting and iterative tweaking of analyses directly results in an artificial clustering of p-values just under the .05 threshold, while almost entirely emptying the region just above it.

Lena's statement that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant\" is a realistic reflection of this institutional and personal pressure.\n2.  **Career Stakes for PhD Students:** For a third-year PhD student, a successful, publishable first-author paper, especially one supporting a new theory, is immensely important for securing a postdoctoral position.

Lena's concern that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" is a very common and legitimate anxiety among graduate students.\n3.  **Natural Desire for Success:** The phrase \"I need this one to work\" expresses a strong desire for the research hypothesis to be supported and for the experiment to yield meaningful, publishable results. This is a natural and healthy motivation for any researcher who has invested significant time, effort, and intellectual energy into a project. It reflects hope and ambition, not necessarily a predisposition to commit fraud.

Lena could run numerous analyses with slightly varied exclusion criteria or other parameters until she found the specific combination that yielded the desired statistically significant results.

If questioned, she could easily argue that she was simply following lab protocol to explore robustness.\n\n2.  **Facilitation of Misconduct:** The availability and expectation of running multiple scripts with varying parameters (like exclusion criteria) directly facilitates p-hacking. It gives a researcher the means to \"fish\" for significant results by tweaking analytical decisions, knowing that these variations are considered normal within the lab context.\n\n3.  **Consistency with \"Looking Perfect\":** Committing misconduct, especially when under pressure, often involves making results \"look perfect\" and professionally sound.

Data from such participants is considered invalid and would likely introduce noise or error, making it harder to find any clear effects, whether genuine or manipulated.\n2.  **Beneficial for Misconduct:** Even a researcher intent on misconduct would want to remove clearly invalid data. Noisy data from non-compliant participants could obscure a desired effect or make it harder to \"p-hack\" a significant result. Removing them would likely lead to cleaner data, which would *aid* in producing the \"strong, statistically significant support\" Lena was reportedly under pressure to deliver.\n3.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A researcher engaging in misconduct often tries to maintain an overall appearance of ethical and competent research. Performing standard and transparent data cleaning, like excluding participants for clear and documented reasons, contributes to this facade.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, it is still moderately likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **First-time Offender Under Pressure:** Misconduct is not always a consistent, career-long pattern. Researchers, even those with previously strong ethical records, can succumb to extreme pressure. The scenario highlights immense pressure on Professor Mills (\"counting on this study to save the grant\") and Lena (\"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"). This unique, high-stakes environment for *this specific study* might have driven Lena to commit misconduct for the first time, despite her previous adherence to good practices.\n2.  **Nature of the Audit:** While \"independent data audit\" and \"well-documented and reproducible\" are strong indicators of good practice, not all audits are designed to catch sophisticated forms of selective reporting or p-hacking (which appear to be at play with the p-value clustering and preregistration modification). A prior audit might have focused on ensuring raw data matched reported numbers and that scripts ran correctly, rather than exhaustively scrutinizing the *selection* of analyses or exclusion criteria if there wasn't a pre-existing reason for suspicion.\n3.  **Hiding the Misconduct:** A researcher who is committing misconduct might still maintain excellent data management practices overall to avoid suspicion. Producing well-documented and reproducible work for previous projects could create a facade of competence and integrity, making it harder for later, more subtle misconduct to be detected.\n\nTherefore, while a clean prior record makes misconduct *less likely in general*, if we *assume* misconduct occurred in the current study, it is plausible that this represents an isolated or escalated incident driven by specific, intense pressures, rather than a consistent pattern of fraud that simply went undetected in the past.\n\n65"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Software Switches are Common:** Research labs, like any technology-dependent environment, can switch software for various reasons: new licenses, improved functionality, supervisor preference, or a collective decision to standardize. Doing so \"halfway through the project\" is inconvenient but not unheard of. It represents a logistical challenge, not an indication of misconduct.\n2.  **Hardware Failures are Unfortunate Realities:** Hard drive failures are a common and frustrating aspect of computer usage. Laptops, being portable, can be more susceptible to wear and tear or accidental damage. The fact that the IT department *confirms* a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time adds significant credibility to this explanation. It's an independently verified event.\n3.  **Missing Files are a Consequence:** When a hard drive fails, especially if backups are not perfectly up-to-date or comprehensive, the loss of some files is a natural and expected consequence. This is a mundane, albeit serious, problem that happens regularly in academic and professional settings.\n4.  **\"Mundane Explanations\":** The problem description itself labels these as \"mundane explanations\" for some suspicious patterns. This indicates that they are presented as plausible, non-fraudulent reasons for potential irregularities.\n\nThese events, individually and combined, are entirely consistent with the normal course of research, where unforeseen technical and logistical challenges can arise. They are unfortunate coincidences that could affect any researcher, regardless of their ethical conduct.\n\n90"

Labs switch software for various reasons (e.g., updates, cost, new features), and hard drives fail due to hardware issues, not because of a user's intent to commit fraud. The IT department's confirmation further underscores the objective reality of the hardware failure.\n2.  **Coincidence and Opportunity:** Such events are unfortunate but common occurrences in research settings. If Lena were committing misconduct, these incidents might even be *convenient* for her, providing plausible, \"mundane explanations\" for any gaps or inconsistencies in her data, scripts, or audit trail that might otherwise point to her fraudulent activities. For example, missing files due to a hard drive crash could be invoked to explain the absence of original analysis scripts that show her p-hacking process.\n3.  **No Causal Link:** There is no logical or causal connection between a researcher's decision to commit misconduct and the likelihood of a lab changing software or their personal computer hardware failing. These are separate categories of events.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these events occurring remains high because they are common challenges in research and technology, regardless of whether a researcher is acting ethically or unethically.\n\n90"

    "content": "The evidence presented points strongly towards academic misconduct. While Lena has some mitigating factors and plausible \"mundane explanations\" for minor irregularities, several key pieces of information are highly diagnostic of intentional manipulation:\n\n1.  **Preregistration Document Modification:** The modification of the preregistration document *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a severe breach of research ethics. The likelihood of this happening without intentional misconduct (to 'fit' results) is extremely low. Conversely, if misconduct occurred, this action is a classic tactic to retroactively legitimize p-hacking or HARKing.\n\n2.  **P-value Clustering:** The \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a statistical signature of p-hacking. This pattern is exceedingly unlikely to occur naturally in genuine research, especially across \"several exploratory analyses.\" If misconduct occurred, this is a highly probable outcome of iterative data analysis and selective reporting aimed at achieving significance.\n\n3.  **Emails Expressing Intense Pressure:** Lena's emails explicitly stating the high stakes (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") provide a clear and compelling motive for academic misconduct. While these feelings are common, they are also a significant driver for individuals who ultimately choose to manipulate data.\n\n**Mitigating Factors / Ambiguous Evidence:**\n\n*   **Prior Good Record:** Lena's previous clean record and successful audit are important. This suggests that if misconduct occurred, it might be an isolated incident driven by extreme pressure, rather than a habitual pattern of fraud. However, it doesn't negate the direct evidence of suspicious actions in *this* study.\n*   **Legitimate Exclusions:** The exclusion of two participants for clear reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with predating notes shows Lena *can* follow ethical data cleaning practices for obvious issues. This doesn't, however, explain other potentially selective exclusions or the p-value distribution.\n*   **Lab-Wide Robustness Push & Multiple Scripts:** The practice of running multiple analysis scripts for robustness is generally good. However, if Lena committed misconduct, this lab policy would have provided both the tools and a plausible cover for systematic p-hacking. The existence of an earlier script with more participants is consistent with both innocent data cleaning and selective exclusion.\n*   **Software Switch & Hard Drive Failure:** These are indeed \"mundane explanations\" for missing files or data inconsistencies. They are external factors and don't directly prove or disprove misconduct. However, they could be conveniently used to explain away other missing evidence or irregularities if misconduct occurred.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence for misconduct, particularly the post-hoc modification of preregistration regarding primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, and the highly unusual p-value distribution, is very strong and points directly to intentional manipulation. These are not minor \"honest mistakes\" or \"miscommunication\" for a third-year PhD student who should be well-versed in research ethics. While her prior good record offers some counterpoint, the specific actions taken in this study are classic indicators of academic fraud, likely driven by the immense pressure she articulated in her emails.\n\nGiven the almost impossible statistical unlikelihood of the p-value clustering under innocent circumstances, combined with the clear ethical violation of retrospective preregistration changes, the probability of misconduct is very high.\n\n85"
