  "No.\n\nThe critical evidence is the timing gap: Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, but the printer's error log shows the critical failure occurred at 5:19 pm. This 7-minute window where Alex was physically absent creates a strong alibi that makes it highly unlikely he directly caused the breakdown.\n\nCombined with Alex's established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems, the printer's documented mechanical defects, and the alternative explanation of cumulative damage from Jamie's forceful handling and ongoing mechanical issues, the evidence points away from Alex being responsible for breaking the printer."
