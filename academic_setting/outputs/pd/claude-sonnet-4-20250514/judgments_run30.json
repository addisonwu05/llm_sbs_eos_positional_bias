  "No.\n\nThe timing evidence is decisive - Alex badged out at 5:12 PM but the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 PM. He was physically absent from the building when the printer failure was logged, making it impossible for him to have directly caused the breakdown at that moment.\n\nCombined with the documented manufacturing defects in this printer model, Jamie's earlier forceful handling captured on security footage, and Alex's proactive attempts to get the printer serviced before it failed, the evidence points to a delayed mechanical failure rather than deliberate damage by Alex."
