The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is a normal part of the research process for several legitimate reasons:\n\n**Standard exclusion practices:**\n- Participants who didn't meet inclusion criteria upon closer examination\n- Those who failed attention checks or manipulation checks\n- Participants with incomplete data or technical issues during data collection\n- Outliers identified through pre-registered statistical criteria\n- Data quality issues discovered during cleaning (e.g., response patterns suggesting non-engagement)\n\n**Timeline considerations:**\n- Initial scripts are often written to include all collected data\n- Exclusion criteria are typically applied systematically after data collection is complete\n- Pre-registered analysis plans usually specify exclusion criteria that get implemented during final analysis\n\n**Good research practices:**\n- Maintaining a clear audit trail of inclusions/exclusions\n- Documenting reasons for each exclusion\n- Having exclusion criteria determined before examining results (to avoid bias)\n\nThe fact that earlier scripts included more participants is actually evidence of transparent record-keeping rather than misconduct. What would be concerning is if exclusions appeared to be made selectively to improve results, or if exclusion criteria changed after seeing the data without proper justification.\n\nGiven that participant exclusion for legitimate reasons is standard practice in psychological research, and earlier versions of analysis scripts commonly include participants later excluded through proper protocols, this finding is very consistent with honest research conduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "Based on the totality of evidence, I need to weigh several strongly conflicting indicators:\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n- Modified preregistration after data collection (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) - this is extremely problematic and hard to justify innocently\n- Suspicious p-value distribution clustering just below .05 with few above - a classic statistical signature of manipulation\n- Clear documented motivation and pressure (\"need this one to work,\" career desperation, grant pressure)\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n- Strong prior track record with independent audit validation\n- Some exclusions were clearly legitimate and properly documented before submission\n- Technical issues (software switch, hard drive failure) are independently verified and plausible\n- Lab-wide culture of robustness testing provides context for multiple analysis scripts\n\n**Mixed/contextual evidence:**\n- Multiple analysis scripts could represent either good practice or result shopping\n- Missing files could be innocent technical problems or convenient evidence destruction\n- Pressure and motivation exist in both innocent and guilty scenarios\n\n**Critical assessment:**\nThe preregistration modification after data collection is the most damaging evidence - this represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles that's very difficult to explain as innocent error. Combined with the suspicious p-value clustering pattern, these create strong statistical and procedural red flags.\n\nHowever, the strong prior track record and some clearly legitimate practices create reasonable doubt. The case isn't definitive, but the weight of evidence, particularly the post-hoc preregistration changes and statistical patterns, points toward misconduct.\n\n72"

While Lena has mitigating factors like her clean prior record and some legitimate research practices, these core indicators point to deliberate misconduct rather than honest errors or normal research variability."
