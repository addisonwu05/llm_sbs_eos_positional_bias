The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Graduate students are typically well aware of their lab's funding pressures, and Professor Mills being under pressure before a grant review is an objective reality that would affect the entire lab.\n\n2. **\"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\"** - This reflects the harsh realities of academic career pressures. Postdoc positions are highly competitive, and having significant publications is often essential. A third-year PhD student would naturally be thinking about their career prospects, especially when working on what's described as a \"high-profile experiment.\"\n\n3. **\"I need this one to work\"** - This expresses hope for positive results, which is entirely natural for any researcher who has invested significant time and effort into a study. Wanting your research to succeed is universal among academics.\n\nThese statements represent normal academic anxieties and pressures that any graduate student in this situation would likely experience and express to a close friend. The academic environment creates these pressures regardless of a researcher's integrity. An innocent student facing funding pressures, career concerns, and working on an important study would very naturally voice these same worries.\n\nThe emails show awareness of stakes and consequences, but not intent to manipulate data. They reflect the stressful reality of academic life that affects honest researchers just as much as dishonest ones.\n\n85"

Someone under intense pressure who decides to fabricate or falsify results would very likely be expressing exactly these concerns beforehand - the grant pressure, career consequences, and desperation (\"I need this one to work\") are classic motivating factors for research misconduct.\n\n**Natural Expression of Pressure**: Even someone planning misconduct would genuinely feel and express these pressures. The emails could represent her authentic emotional state while she was contemplating or deciding to manipulate the data. People who commit misconduct don't suddenly stop having normal emotional responses to academic pressure.\n\n**Potential Rationalization**: These statements could reflect her mental process of justifying misconduct to herself - emphasizing how much is at stake and how unfair a null result would be given the circumstances. This kind of rationalization is common among those who commit research fraud.\n\n**Establishing a Narrative**: Whether consciously or unconsciously, these emails help establish a story about external pressures that could later be used to explain her actions as being driven by circumstances rather than character flaws.\n\n**Lack of Self-Censorship**: Someone committing misconduct might not anticipate that private communications could become evidence, so they would express their genuine concerns without considering how incriminating these motivations might appear later.\n\nThe key insight is that having strong motives for misconduct doesn't make someone less likely to express those motives - it often makes them more likely to do so.\n\n88"

This is a fundamental principle of good research practice.\n\n**Alternative Approaches Available**: If an innocent researcher discovered legitimate issues with their original preregistration after data collection, the proper approach would be to:\n- Acknowledge the changes transparently in the manuscript\n- Conduct analyses as both preregistered and revised\n- Potentially treat revised analyses as exploratory rather than confirmatory\n- Contact the journal/preregistration platform about amendments with clear justification\n\n**Technical Safeguards**: Most preregistration platforms (OSF, AsPredicted, etc.) are designed to prevent or clearly document post-hoc changes, often requiring explicit justification for modifications and maintaining version histories.\n\n**Career Risks**: An innocent researcher would recognize that secretly modifying preregistration creates enormous professional risk if discovered, far outweighing any potential benefit.\n\n**Supervisory Oversight**: Even under pressure, an innocent researcher would likely consult with their supervisor about any necessary changes rather than unilaterally modifying the preregistration.\n\nThe only somewhat plausible innocent explanation might be correcting a genuine clerical error immediately after registration, but changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data crosses clear ethical boundaries that an experienced PhD student would recognize.\n\n15"

These modifications would be essential tools for making fabricated or manipulated data appear legitimate and well-supported.\n\n**Part of a Coordinated Deception**: Someone already willing to fabricate or falsify data would likely recognize that the preregistration creates a paper trail that needs to be \"cleaned up\" to avoid detection. The preregistration document serves as evidence of original intent, so modifying it helps create a coherent false narrative.\n\n**HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)**: Even if the data manipulation was subtle, changing the preregistration would allow her to present post-hoc analyses as if they were planned confirmatory tests, greatly strengthening the apparent evidential value of the results.\n\n**Risk-Benefit Calculation**: Someone already committing the major violation of data manipulation would likely see modifying the preregistration as a relatively minor additional step that significantly reduces detection risk. The marginal increase in misconduct severity would be small compared to the protection it provides.\n\n**Systematic Approach**: Research misconduct often involves multiple coordinated deceptive acts rather than isolated incidents.

A natural clustering just below .05 with almost none just above .05 violates these expected distributions and suggests artificial manipulation around the significance threshold.\n\n**Publication Bias vs. Analysis Pattern**: While publication bias can create some clustering below .05 in the published literature, this occurs at the publication selection stage, not within a single study's multiple analyses. Within one dataset, you shouldn't see this pattern unless someone is specifically manipulating results to achieve significance.\n\n**Exploratory Analysis Context**: The fact that this pattern appears in \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it even more suspicious. Exploratory analyses typically have lower power and should show more variable p-values. Consistently achieving near-significant results across multiple exploratory tests suggests deliberate optimization.\n\n**Statistical Improbability**: The probability of randomly achieving multiple p-values in the narrow range of .041-.049 while avoiding the .051-.059 range is extremely low. This would be like flipping a coin 20 times and getting exactly 11 heads every time - technically possible but practically impossible without intervention.\n\n**No Innocent Mechanism**: There's no legitimate analytical or data collection process that would naturally produce this pattern. Even selective reporting of analyses would likely show more variation in the significant results.\n\nThis pattern is a well-known signature of p-hacking or data manipulation in the research integrity literature.\n\n5"

Someone manipulating results would specifically target the .05 threshold, systematically adjusting analyses, exclusions, or data points until results fall just below the significance level. The concentration around .041-.049 suggests deliberate fine-tuning to achieve significance.\n\n**Selective Data Manipulation**: A person fabricating or falsifying data would naturally focus on making results \"just significant enough\" rather than creating obviously perfect results that might raise suspicion. Values like .047 and .049 appear more believable than .001, while still achieving the crucial goal of statistical significance.\n\n**Multiple Analysis Optimization**: The fact this appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" indicates systematic manipulation across the dataset. Someone committing misconduct would likely apply the same approach to multiple tests, creating this consistent pattern of near-threshold significance.\n\n**Avoiding the \"Failure Zone\"**: The absence of p-values just above .05 (.051-.059) is particularly telling. In legitimate research, you'd expect some analyses to fall narrowly on the non-significant side. The systematic avoidance of this range suggests deliberate intervention to push all results below the significance threshold.\n\n**Known Manipulation Strategy**: This pattern aligns perfectly with documented cases of research misconduct where perpetrators manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistical significance while trying to maintain plausibility.\n\n**Risk-Reward Optimization**: Someone already committing misconduct would recognize that this pattern provides maximum publication benefit while appearing less suspicious than overly perfect results.\n\n95"

Researchers typically start with all collected data and then apply exclusion criteria systematically. It's common to have preliminary scripts that include everyone before applying proper screening.\n\n**Discovery of Protocol Violations**: During data processing, researchers often discover that some participants didn't follow instructions, had technical problems during testing, failed attention checks, or otherwise violated study protocols in ways that weren't immediately apparent during data collection.\n\n**Preregistered Exclusion Criteria**: Legitimate exclusion criteria are often applied after initial data inspection - things like outlier detection, manipulation checks, or performance thresholds that can only be evaluated once all data is collected and processed.\n\n**Quality Control Findings**: Data quality issues (equipment malfunctions, incomplete responses, obvious response patterns indicating disengagement) often become apparent only during detailed analysis.\n\n**Iterative Analysis Development**: It's normal for analysis scripts to evolve as researchers refine their approach, and early versions often include participants who are later properly excluded according to established criteria.\n\n**Documentation and Transparency**: The fact that earlier versions exist in automated backups actually suggests good data management practices rather than misconduct - someone hiding misconduct might be more likely to delete evidence.\n\nThe key factor is whether the exclusions follow predetermined, justifiable criteria rather than being based on how individual participants' data affect the results.\n\n75"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, having two participants excluded for falling asleep or not understanding instructions based on notes that predate journal submission would still be quite likely for several reasons:\n\n**Mixed Legitimate and Illegitimate Exclusions**: Someone committing misconduct would likely combine legitimate exclusions (like these two participants) with illegitimate ones. The presence of clearly justified exclusions doesn't preclude other exclusions being results-driven. She could have properly excluded obviously problematic participants while also removing others based on their data patterns.\n\n**Establishing Credibility**: Including some obviously legitimate exclusions with proper documentation helps establish a pattern of careful data management that could provide cover for more questionable exclusions. These two cases could serve as examples of her \"rigorous standards.\"\n\n**Standard Research Practice Maintained**: Even someone manipulating data might still follow normal protocols for clear-cut cases. Someone who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions would be excluded by any researcher, honest or not, making these exclusions expected regardless of overall integrity.\n\n**Selective Documentation**: She might have been more careful to document the most defensible exclusions while being less thorough with documentation for participants excluded primarily because their data hurt the results.\n\n**Real Issues Occur**: Legitimate participant problems happen in every study. The fact that she documented these appropriately doesn't contradict the possibility that she also made inappropriate exclusions of other participants whose only \"problem\" was producing inconvenient data.\n\n**Timeline Strategy**: Creating proper documentation early in the process, before knowing which exclusions might be questioned, would be a smart approach for someone planning systematic misconduct.\n\n82"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the highly suspicious indicators against the mitigating factors.\n\n**Strongly Incriminating Evidence:**\n- **Modified preregistration after data collection** - This is extremely damning. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-hoc fundamentally undermines the integrity of the preregistration process and is very difficult to explain innocently (my assessment: 15% likely if innocent, 92% if guilty).\n\n- **P-value clustering just below .05** - This pattern across multiple exploratory analyses is a classic signature of p-hacking or data manipulation. The systematic avoidance of p-values just above .05 while clustering around .041-.049 is statistically extremely improbable without intervention (5% likely if innocent, 95% if guilty).\n\n- **Participant exclusions between script versions** - While exclusions can be legitimate, combined with the preregistration changes, this suggests results-driven selection (75% likely if innocent, 88% if guilty).\n\n**Contextual Factors:**\n- **Pressure and motive** - Her emails clearly document strong incentives for misconduct, though these pressures affect honest researchers too (85% likely if innocent, 88% if guilty).\n\n**Mitigating Evidence:**\n- **Previous clean record** - Her strong track record provides some protection but doesn't preclude first-time misconduct under extreme pressure.\n- **Lab robustness practices** - Multiple analysis scripts are explained by lab-wide initiatives.\n- **Technical issues** - Software changes and hard drive failure provide some cover for irregularities.\n- **Legitimate exclusions** - Two participants had clear, documented reasons for exclusion.\n\nThe preregistration modification and p-value clustering are particularly damning because they represent objective, quantifiable evidence that is extremely difficult to explain through honest mistakes or external circumstances. These patterns are well-established signatures of research misconduct.\n\nWhile the mitigating factors prevent certainty, the combination of post-hoc preregistration changes and suspicious p-value distributions creates a strong case for misconduct.\n\n78"

While individual pieces of evidence might have innocent explanations, these two factors together form a pattern consistent with systematic research misconduct."
