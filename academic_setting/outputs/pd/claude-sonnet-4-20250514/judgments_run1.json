  "Looking at all the evidence, the most compelling factor is the p-value distribution showing an unusually high concentration just below .05 with almost none just above. This statistical pattern is virtually impossible to occur naturally and represents one of the strongest objective indicators of data manipulation in research integrity investigations.\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors - Lena's strong prior record, some legitimate exclusions, and institutional context that explains some irregularities - the combination of the suspicious p-value pattern, preregistration modifications after data collection, clear motive from the pressure emails, and participant exclusions creates a pattern more consistent with misconduct than with honest research practices.\n\nThe technical issues (software switch, hard drive failure) and lab-wide robustness testing, while providing some cover, don't adequately explain the core statistical signature of manipulation.\n\n**Yes**"
