  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence points strongly toward academic misconduct. The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. The p-value clustering just below .05 with virtually no values just above .05 - this is a classic statistical signature of data manipulation that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. The post-hoc modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - this represents a clear violation of research integrity principles and suggests deliberate deception.\n\n3. The combination of strong motive (career pressure, grant dependence) with these suspicious patterns creates a coherent narrative of misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena has mitigating factors (good track record, technical issues, some legitimate exclusions), the statistical evidence and preregistration tampering are particularly difficult to explain through innocent means. These represent systematic patterns consistent with deliberate manipulation rather than honest mistakes or technical problems."
