The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is one of the most recognized statistical signatures of research misconduct.\n\n**Exploratory analyses**: The fact that this pattern appears in \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it even more suspicious, as exploratory analyses are particularly vulnerable to p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\n**Possible innocent explanations (but unlikely):**\n- **Publication bias effects**: Researchers might unconsciously conduct more rigorous checks on analyses approaching significance, but this would typically affect study design, not create such a stark pattern\n- **Coincidence**: Extremely unlikely that multiple independent tests would naturally cluster this way\n- **Software/rounding issues**: Could theoretically cause clustering, but wouldn't explain the absence of values just above .05\n\n**Why this strongly indicates misconduct:**\n- This pattern is mathematically improbable in honest research\n- It matches known signatures of p-hacking, data dredging, or selective analysis\n- The \"file drawer\" effect alone cannot explain this - it would require active manipulation\n- Multiple analyses showing this pattern suggests systematic rather than accidental bias\n\nThis type of p-value distribution is considered a major red flag in research integrity investigations and is cited in statistical guidelines for detecting research misconduct.\n\n15"

It directly reflects the process of manipulating data or analyses until results cross the significance threshold.\n\n**Methods that produce this pattern:**\n- **Selective data exclusion**: Systematically removing participants until p-values drop below .05\n- **Optional stopping**: Running additional participants until significance is achieved, then stopping\n- **Analytical flexibility**: Trying different statistical models, transformations, or covariates until p < .05\n- **Selective reporting**: Running many analyses but only reporting those that achieved significance\n- **Direct data fabrication**: Creating or modifying data points to push p-values just below the threshold\n\n**Why the clustering occurs:**\n- The misconduct process naturally stops once p < .05 is achieved\n- There's strong motivation to reach but not dramatically exceed significance (which might look suspicious)\n- Results just above .05 get \"fixed\" through further manipulation\n- The .05 threshold acts as a \"magnet\" for fraudulent practices\n\n**Supporting evidence:**\n- **Multiple exploratory analyses**: Shows systematic rather than isolated manipulation\n- **Sharp cliff at .05**: Natural variation would show more gradual distribution\n- **Concentration just below threshold**: Suggests repeated attempts to achieve significance\n\n**Why this is nearly diagnostic:**\nThis pattern is so strongly associated with misconduct that it's used by statisticians and journals as a primary screening tool for research integrity issues. The probability of this occurring naturally across multiple analyses is astronomically low.\n\n**The only scenario where this might occur with misconduct is if Lena used very sophisticated methods to avoid detection, but the evidence suggests more typical p-hacking approaches.**\n\n85"

The technical events themselves are real, but their utility for explaining away suspicions is notable.\n\n65"

    "content": "Based on all the evidence presented, I need to weigh the factors pointing toward and away from academic misconduct.\n\n**Strong evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n**P-value distribution pattern**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above is extremely suspicious (probability of innocence: 15). This is one of the strongest statistical signatures of research misconduct and is difficult to explain through legitimate means.\n\n**Modified preregistration**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious breach of research integrity (probability of innocence: 10). This represents fundamental violation of preregistration principles.\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n\n**Clean prior record**: Previous studies passing independent audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" ratings strongly supports her integrity (probability of guilt given this: 40).\n\n**Legitimate exclusions**: Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with contemporaneous notes represents proper research practice (probability of innocence: 95).\n\n**Lab-wide practices**: Multiple analysis scripts being standard lab practice provides plausible explanation for extensive data exploration (probability of innocence: 90).\n\n**Technical issues**: Confirmed hardware failure and software transition provide mundane explanations for some irregularities (probability of innocence: 75).\n\n**Ambiguous evidence:**\n\n**Participant exclusions and pressure emails**: Common in both legitimate and fraudulent research contexts.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe p-value clustering and preregistration modification are extremely strong indicators of misconduct that are very difficult to explain innocently. While Lena's prior record and some legitimate practices provide mitigating evidence, the statistical fingerprints of manipulation are compelling and specific.\n\nThe combination of these two highly suspicious patterns, occurring together in a high-pressure situation, outweighs the mitigating factors.\n\n75"

The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above, combined with the post-hoc modification of preregistration criteria and outcomes after data collection, represents a pattern that is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices alone. While Lena's prior clean record and some legitimate practices provide important context, these two pieces of evidence together constitute strong statistical fingerprints of research misconduct that outweigh the mitigating factors."
