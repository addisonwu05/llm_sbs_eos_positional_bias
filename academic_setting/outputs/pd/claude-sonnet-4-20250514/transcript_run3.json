    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is a normal part of the research process for several legitimate reasons:\n\n**Standard exclusion practices:**\n- Pre-registered exclusion criteria are often applied after initial data collection (e.g., removing participants who didn't follow instructions, had technical issues, or met predetermined exclusion criteria)\n- Quality control checks typically happen after data collection, leading to exclusions based on attention checks, incomplete responses, or outlier detection\n- Protocol violations discovered during data review (e.g., participants who didn't meet inclusion criteria)\n\n**Timeline considerations:**\n- Research workflows commonly involve running preliminary analyses on all collected data, then applying exclusion criteria systematically\n- Backup scripts often capture intermediate stages of analysis before final data cleaning\n- It's standard practice to document the full dataset before applying exclusions for transparency\n\n**Documentation expectations:**\n- Responsible researchers maintain records of all participants and exclusions with clear justifications\n- Having earlier versions with more participants actually demonstrates proper version control and transparency\n- This pattern aligns with pre-registration practices where exclusion criteria are specified in advance\n\nThe fact that excluded participants appear in earlier analysis scripts is not only plausible but expected in rigorous research. What would be concerning is if there were no documentation of exclusions or if exclusions appeared to be selectively applied to improve results without justification.\n\nGiven that participant exclusion following predetermined criteria is standard practice in cognitive neuroscience research, this evidence is highly consistent with legitimate research conduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "Based on the totality of evidence, I believe there is a substantial probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, though not with complete certainty.\n\n**Strong evidence pointing toward misconduct:**\n\nThe most damaging evidence includes:\n- **Post-hoc preregistration modifications**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection (95% likely if misconduct) is a serious red flag that directly undermines scientific integrity\n- **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above represents a classic statistical signature of data manipulation (92% likely if misconduct vs 25% if innocent)\n- **Pressure and motive**: Lena's emails explicitly documented the exact pressures that commonly drive misconduct - career desperation, supervisor pressure, and grant stakes\n\n**Moderating evidence:**\n\nSeveral factors provide some doubt:\n- **Clean prior record**: Her previously audited work was exemplary, suggesting this could be situational misconduct under extreme pressure rather than a pattern\n- **Technical explanations**: The software switch, hardware failure, and lab-wide robustness testing provide plausible alternative explanations for some irregularities\n- **Some legitimate exclusions**: The documented exclusions of participants who fell asleep show proper research practices were followed in some cases\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\nThe preregistration modifications and p-value patterns are particularly damning because they represent sophisticated attempts to disguise results-driven decisions as principled research. When combined with documented motive and pressure, these create a compelling case for intentional misconduct. While the mitigating evidence shows this likely represents situational pressure rather than systematic fraud, the core statistical and procedural irregularities are very difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nThe evidence suggests a researcher who typically maintained good practices but made poor decisions under extraordinary pressure.\n\n72"

While Lena appears to have been under significant pressure and may have had a previously clean record, these specific patterns are hallmarks of research misconduct that go beyond what could reasonably be attributed to honest mistakes or technical issues."
