    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate this scenario, I need to consider how likely it would be for an innocent researcher to modify a preregistration document after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nPreregistration is specifically designed to prevent data-driven changes to analysis plans that could inflate the chances of finding significant results. The fundamental principle is that hypotheses, analysis plans, and exclusion criteria should be locked in before seeing the data to avoid unconscious or conscious bias in analysis decisions.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, there are a few potential innocent explanations for post-data modifications to preregistration:\n\n1. **Administrative error**: She might have accidentally uploaded or saved over the wrong version of the document\n2. **Clarification of ambiguous language**: She might have felt the need to clarify vague wording without changing the substantive intent\n3. **Correction of obvious typos or formatting issues**\n4. **Misunderstanding of preregistration protocols**: She might not have fully understood that the document should remain unchanged\n\nHowever, several factors make innocent explanations less likely:\n\n- Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data is a classic form of selective reporting/p-hacking\n- Modifying primary outcomes post-hoc is similarly problematic and well-known to be inappropriate\n- As a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab, Lena should be well-trained in research integrity principles\n- The changes involved substantive methodological elements (exclusion criteria and outcomes), not just minor administrative corrections\n- These types of changes directly benefit the strength of the reported findings\n\nThe combination of changing both exclusion criteria AND primary outcomes after data collection represents exactly the kind of post-hoc modifications that preregistration is designed to prevent. While honest mistakes are possible, making these specific types of changes that happen to improve the results suggests a very low probability of innocent error.\n\nThe fact that these modifications occurred specifically on elements that could influence the statistical outcomes, rather than on administrative or formatting issues, is particularly concerning from an integrity standpoint.\n\n15"

These represent specific statistical fingerprints of misconduct that are difficult to explain through honest error or technical problems. While the mitigating factors provide some plausible alternative explanations, they don't adequately account for the most problematic patterns.\n\nThe technical disruptions and lab practices could facilitate misconduct as much as excuse it. A clean prior record, while notable, doesn't preclude misconduct under unprecedented pressure.\n\nThe convergence of multiple red flags (preregistration changes + suspicious p-values + selective exclusions + high pressure) creates a pattern more consistent with misconduct than with honest research affected by technical problems.\n\n72"

While there are mitigating factors and alternative explanations for individual pieces of evidence, the convergence of multiple red flags that specifically benefit the research outcomes suggests intentional manipulation rather than coincidental technical problems or honest errors."
