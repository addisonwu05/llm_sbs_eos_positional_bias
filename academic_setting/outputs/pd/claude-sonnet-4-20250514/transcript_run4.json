The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this from the perspective of legitimate research, I need to consider how common robustness testing and sensitivity analyses are in proper scientific practice.\n\n**Why this would be very likely for innocent researchers:**\n\n1. **Standard robustness testing**: Running analyses with different exclusion criteria to test the stability of findings is considered good scientific practice and often required by journals\n\n2. **Lab-wide initiative**: The fact that this was a systematic lab policy rather than Lena's individual decision makes it clearly legitimate research practice\n\n3. **Sensitivity analysis protocols**: Testing both stricter and looser criteria helps establish whether findings are robust or depend on specific analytical choices\n\n4. **Peer behavior pattern**: Other students showing similar patterns provides strong evidence this represents normal lab methodology rather than individual misconduct\n\n5. **Transparent documentation**: Storing multiple scripts in logged systems demonstrates openness rather than attempting to hide analytical choices\n\n6. **Educational value**: Exploring different analytical approaches is valuable for graduate student training in research methodology\n\n**Why this strongly supports legitimate research:**\n\n- Represents exactly what responsible researchers do to validate their findings\n- The systematic, lab-wide nature shows institutional support for rigorous methodology\n- Storing rather than deleting alternative analyses demonstrates transparency\n- Consistency across multiple students indicates established best practices rather than individual manipulation\n\n**Research integrity context:**\n\nModern research emphasizes transparency about analytical choices and robustness testing. Many journals now require or encourage reporting sensitivity analyses with different exclusion criteria to demonstrate that findings aren't dependent on arbitrary decisions.\n\nThis pattern represents exemplary research practices focused on establishing the robustness and reliability of findings through systematic sensitivity testing.\n\n88"

Someone engaging in questionable practices would still need to maintain appearances and follow lab protocols, while the multiple analysis options could facilitate rather than prevent selective reporting.\n\nHaving many analysis scripts is not inconsistent with misconduct - it could provide both cover and opportunities for manipulation.\n\n78"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the suspicious indicators against the mitigating factors.\n\n**Strong evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection** - This is a serious red flag. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-hoc directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is highly unusual for legitimate research (my assessment: 85% likely if misconduct, 15% if innocent).\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution** - The clustering of p-values just below .05 with absence of values just above is a classic signature of data manipulation or p-hacking (92% likely if misconduct, 8% if innocent).\n\n3. **Participant exclusions between analysis versions** - While this can be legitimate, in the context of other evidence it becomes more concerning, especially given the modified preregistration.\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n\n1. **Clean prior record** - Passing an independent audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" work is strong evidence of established integrity (85% likely if innocent, 25% if misconduct).\n\n2. **Legitimate exclusions with proper documentation** - The two participants with clear validity issues were properly excluded with pre-submission notes.\n\n3. **Lab-wide robustness testing** - Multiple analysis scripts align with good research practices and lab policy.\n\n4. **Verified technical issues** - Software switch and confirmed hardware failure provide mundane explanations for some irregularities.\n\n**Neutral evidence:**\n- Pressure emails are consistent with both scenarios\n- Technical disruptions occur regardless of intent\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\nThe preregistration modification and p-value clustering are particularly damaging pieces of evidence that are difficult to explain innocently. While Lena's prior record is excellent, the current evidence shows a pattern of behaviors that collectively suggest systematic manipulation rather than coincidental irregularities.\n\nThe combination of multiple suspicious elements (preregistration changes, p-value optimization, selective exclusions) working together to improve statistical outcomes suggests intentional misconduct rather than honest mistakes.\n\n72"
