  "Yes.\n\nThe combination of evidence creates a compelling case for academic misconduct:\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection** - This is fundamentally incompatible with research integrity, especially when changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\n2. **Statistical fingerprints of manipulation** - The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above is a classic signature of data manipulation that would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Pattern consistency** - The excluded participants, modified preregistration, and suspicious p-values form a coherent pattern of systematic data manipulation.\n\n4. **Clear motive and opportunity** - The documented pressure regarding the grant and her career, combined with sole control over data processing, establishes both motivation and means.\n\nWhile her previous clean record and some legitimate exclusions provide counterevidence, the core statistical and procedural violations are too serious and consistent to be explained by technical issues or honest mistakes. The preregistration modification alone represents a fundamental breach of research integrity that undermines alternative explanations.\n\nThe weight of evidence, particularly the objective statistical patterns and procedural violations, points convincingly toward intentional academic misconduct."
