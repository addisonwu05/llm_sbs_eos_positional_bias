  "No\n\nThe temporal evidence creates the most significant doubt - Alex was demonstrably out of the building when the critical error was logged. While delayed failures are possible, this timing gap significantly weakens the case for direct causation.\n\nAdditionally, Alex's documented history of responsible equipment reporting and proactive maintenance (including warning about this specific printer's problems days earlier) suggests someone who cares about equipment functionality, not someone inclined toward destruction.\n\nThe combination of known mechanical defects in this printer model, Jamie's documented forceful handling, and the genuine ongoing equipment problems provides sufficient alternative explanations for the failure.\n\nWhile some evidence (particularly the plastic fragments) is concerning, it doesn't overcome the reasonable doubt created by Alex's absence during the actual failure and his consistent pattern of responsible behavior with office equipment."
