The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern is virtually impossible to occur naturally and is a well-established indicator of p-hacking.\n- **Preregistration modifications:** Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious red flag that directly enables result optimization.\n- **Motive and pressure:** The emails clearly establish both external pressure (supervisor counting on results for grant) and personal desperation (null results \"killing\" postdoc chances), providing classic motives for misconduct.\n- **Participant exclusions:** The pattern of having more participants in earlier scripts that were later excluded, combined with other factors, suggests potential selective data removal.\n\n**Mitigating evidence:**\n- **Strong prior record:** Independent audit rating her previous work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates established good practices.\n- **Some legitimate exclusions:** Two participants with clear, documented reasons (sleeping, not understanding) show proper quality control.\n- **Institutional context:** Lab-wide robustness testing and confirmed technical issues (IT-verified hard drive failure, software switch) provide legitimate explanations for some irregularities.\n- **Transparent documentation:** The fact that multiple script versions were preserved and logged suggests normal workflow rather than cover-up attempts.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\nThe p-value distribution is the strongest single piece of evidence because it represents an objective statistical signature that is extremely difficult to explain through innocent means. While individual pieces of evidence might have legitimate explanations, the combination creates a concerning pattern.\n\nHowever, the strong prior record and institutional context provide meaningful counterweight. The lab's systematic approach to robustness testing and the verification of technical issues suggest at least some irregularities have innocent explanations.\n\nThe pressure documented in the emails, while establishing clear motive, doesn't prove action was taken. Many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity.\n\nBalancing the statistical red flags and suspicious patterns against the established track record and institutional context, the evidence suggests misconduct is more likely than not, but significant uncertainty remains.\n\n68"
