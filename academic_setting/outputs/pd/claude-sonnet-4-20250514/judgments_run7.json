  "No\n\nThe timing evidence is decisive - Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, but the printer's critical error was logged at 5:19 pm. This 7-minute gap means Alex was not physically present when the failure occurred.\n\nCombined with the documented pattern of identical failures in the same printer model across other departments \"without evidence of improper handling,\" and Alex's proactive attempt to get the printer serviced three days earlier, the evidence points to a mechanical failure rather than user-caused damage.\n\nWhile the circumstantial evidence (fragments, proximity, frustrated messages) creates suspicion, it has plausible alternative explanations, whereas the timing and technical evidence provide objective constraints that strongly support Alex's innocence."
