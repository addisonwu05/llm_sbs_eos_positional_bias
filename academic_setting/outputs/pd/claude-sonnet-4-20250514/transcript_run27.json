The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the mere existence of excluded participants in an earlier script is very common in legitimate research.\n\nGiven the routine nature of participant exclusions in this field and the normal research workflow, this finding alone would be expected in most genuine studies.\n\n85"

    "content": "Looking at the totality of evidence, I need to weigh the suspicious patterns against the mitigating factors and innocent explanations.\n\n**Highly suspicious evidence pointing toward misconduct:**\n- **Post-hoc preregistration modification** (92% likely if misconduct): This is perhaps the strongest evidence, as modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection fundamentally violates research integrity principles\n- **P-value clustering just below .05** (96% likely if misconduct): This statistical pattern is a classic signature of p-hacking and is extremely unlikely to occur naturally\n- **Pressure-revealing emails** (93% likely if misconduct): The documented desperation and high stakes provide clear motive and psychological context for misconduct\n- **Multiple analysis scripts**: While potentially innocent given lab practices, these provided the mechanism for selective result optimization\n\n**Mitigating evidence:**\n- **Clean audit history**: Strong prior record of integrity suggests this would be aberrant behavior\n- **Some legitimate exclusions**: Well-documented exclusions of participants who fell asleep/were confused show proper research practices\n- **Technical disruptions**: Genuine software switch and confirmed hard drive failure provide some innocent explanations for irregularities\n- **Lab-wide analysis practices**: Multiple scripts align with lab culture of robustness testing\n\n**Critical assessment:**\nThe combination of post-hoc preregistration changes with the suspicious p-value distribution creates a very strong statistical and methodological fingerprint of misconduct. These patterns are extremely difficult to explain through innocent means, even accounting for technical disruptions.\n\nWhile Lena's clean history and some legitimate practices provide important context, the convergence of multiple red flags (modified preregistration + p-hacking signature + documented pressure + \"too perfect\" results) creates a compelling case for misconduct despite mitigating factors.\n\nThe technical issues and lab practices may have provided cover and opportunity, but don't adequately explain the specific statistical signatures of manipulation.\n\n78"
