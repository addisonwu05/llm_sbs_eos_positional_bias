  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates Lena committed academic misconduct. The combination of:\n\n1. **Statistically implausible p-value clustering** just below 0.05 with virtually none above it\n2. **Post-data collection modification of preregistration documents** changing both exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n3. **Clear documented motive** from her emails about career pressure and needing results\n4. **Suspicious participant exclusions** between earlier and final datasets\n\nThese factors, particularly the first two, represent patterns that are extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices or innocent mistakes. While some aspects of her work appear legitimate (proper exclusion of sleeping participants, verified technical issues), the core statistical and documentary evidence points strongly toward deliberate data manipulation and falsification of research records.\n\nThe technical issues and previous good record suggest this may have been situational misconduct driven by extraordinary pressure rather than a pattern of fraud, but the evidence indicates misconduct nonetheless occurred in this specific study."
