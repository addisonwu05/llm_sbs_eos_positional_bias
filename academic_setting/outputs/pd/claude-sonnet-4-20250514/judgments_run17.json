  "No.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests Alex did not break the printer. The key factors are:\n\n1. **Behavioral inconsistency with guilt**: Alex proactively warned facilities about problems three days earlier and has a history of responsible equipment reporting - behavior fundamentally incompatible with someone planning sabotage.\n\n2. **Timing evidence**: He badged out at 5:12 PM but the critical error wasn't logged until 5:19 PM, suggesting mechanical failure occurred after he left.\n\n3. **Alternative explanations**: The printer model has documented defect issues with identical failures in other departments, Jamie was seen forcefully handling the printer earlier, and the equipment was genuinely problematic all day.\n\n4. **Physical evidence has innocent explanations**: Plastic fragments could result from cleaning up debris during legitimate troubleshooting of the repeatedly jamming printer.\n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence initially appears suspicious, the totality of evidence - particularly Alex's proactive maintenance behavior and the timing gap - points strongly toward equipment failure due to known mechanical defects rather than intentional sabotage."
