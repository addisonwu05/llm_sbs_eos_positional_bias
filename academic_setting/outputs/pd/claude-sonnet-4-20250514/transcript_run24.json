The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Based on the totality of evidence, I need to weigh the suspicious patterns against the mitigating factors.\n\n**Strong evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\nThe **p-value clustering just below .05** with almost no values just above .05 is extremely suspicious (I rated this as only 15% likely if innocent). This is a well-established red flag in research integrity investigations.\n\nThe **post-hoc modification of preregistration** after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly problematic (I rated this as only 18% likely if innocent). This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\nThe **pressure-laden emails** establish clear motive, with Lena stating she \"needs this one to work\" and describing career-threatening consequences of null results.\n\n**Mitigating evidence:**\n\nHer **clean prior record** with previous studies passing independent audits suggests this would represent a departure from established ethical behavior patterns.\n\nThe **confirmed hardware failure** and **lab-wide robustness testing protocols** provide plausible explanations for some irregularities.\n\nThe **appropriate exclusions** of participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, documented before submission, represent legitimate research practices.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence have innocent explanations, the combination is highly concerning. The p-value clustering and post-hoc preregistration modification are particularly damaging evidence that's difficult to explain innocently. The pressure context provides clear motive, and someone under such pressure might rationalize misconduct while maintaining some legitimate practices.\n\nThe mitigating factors show this isn't a pattern of habitual misconduct, but could represent situation-specific ethical failure under extreme pressure.\n\n75"

While individual pieces of evidence could have legitimate explanations, their convergence - especially alongside the documented pressure and career stakes - points to academic misconduct having occurred."
