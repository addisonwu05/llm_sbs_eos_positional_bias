The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this scenario, I need to consider whether modifying a preregistration document after data collection could happen innocently or if it strongly suggests misconduct.\n\nPreregistration is a fundamental safeguard in research - it's specifically designed to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data (known as HARKing - Hypothesizing After Results are Known). The whole purpose is to lock in the research plan before data collection begins.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, there are very few legitimate reasons why exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be changed after data collection:\n\n**Possible innocent explanations:**\n- Technical error or misunderstanding about when to finalize the preregistration\n- Collaborative confusion about the timeline\n- Software/platform issues that weren't properly documented\n- Administrative oversight where changes were made to correct earlier errors in the document\n\n**However, several factors make innocent explanations unlikely:**\n- As a third-year PhD student, Lena should understand preregistration protocols\n- Exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are core elements that researchers are specifically trained not to change post-hoc\n- The combination of \"too perfect\" data, missing files, software changes, and now preregistration modifications creates a concerning pattern\n- The changes specifically involved exclusion criteria (which could remove inconvenient data points) and primary outcomes (which could shift focus to significant results)\n\nWhile honest mistakes can happen, modifying these particular elements of a preregistration after data collection represents either a serious misunderstanding of research ethics or intentional manipulation. Given that this is happening in the context of other suspicious elements and Lena's level of training, an innocent explanation becomes quite improbable.\n\nThe modification of exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-data collection is exactly the type of behavior that preregistration is designed to prevent and flag as problematic.\n\n15"

These are both strong statistical indicators of misconduct that are very difficult to explain through innocent means. The preregistration modification specifically undermines the technical explanations, as it suggests deliberate post-hoc justification rather than innocent errors.\n\nWhile her clean prior record is notable, research misconduct often emerges situationally under pressure, and the documented pressure here was extreme. The technical issues, while confirmed, are almost suspiciously convenient for someone trying to hide evidence.\n\nThe pattern of evidence - modified preregistration, suspicious p-values, strategic exclusions, clear motive, plus missing files - forms a coherent narrative of misconduct that's stronger than the sum of its parts.\n\n82"

The preregistration modification alone represents a fundamental breach of research integrity that undermines alternative explanations.\n\nThe weight of evidence, particularly the objective statistical patterns and procedural violations, points convincingly toward intentional academic misconduct."
