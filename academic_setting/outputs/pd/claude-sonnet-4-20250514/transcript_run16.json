The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Ethical conduct tends to be a stable personal characteristic.\n\n2. **Good research practices**: Someone trained in proper data management, documentation, and analysis would naturally apply these skills across multiple studies.\n\n3. **Independent verification**: The fact that an independent auditor (not lab members) rated her work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" provides objective confirmation of quality research practices.\n\n4. **Recent timing**: The audit was conducted \"the year before,\" meaning this positive assessment was recent and relevant to her current capabilities and practices.\n\n5. **Same lab environment**: Working in the same lab with the same standards and supervision suggests continuity in research practices and quality control.\n\n6. **Skill development**: Graduate students typically improve their research skills over time, so strong past performance would predict continued good practices.\n\n7. **No red flags**: The absence of any prior irregularities suggests a consistent pattern of ethical research conduct.\n\n**Strong supporting evidence for innocence:**\n- Independent audits are rigorous and objective\n- \"Well-documented and reproducible\" indicates high-quality research practices\n- Consistent track record suggests stable ethical behavior\n- Recent timing makes it highly relevant to current work\n\nThis evidence strongly supports someone who maintains consistent research integrity standards across projects.\n\n95"

The extreme pressure Lena described (grant renewal, postdoc prospects) may have pushed someone with previously ethical practices to cross lines for the first time.\n\n2. **Escalating pressure**: A third-year PhD student faces much higher stakes than in earlier years. Previous studies may have been conducted when career pressures were lower and there was less temptation to manipulate data.\n\n3. **Independent audit rigor**: The fact that her previous work genuinely passed independent scrutiny suggests those studies were legitimate, making this potentially a first-time deviation under extraordinary pressure.\n\n4. **Learned skills misapplied**: Someone skilled in documentation and analysis (as evidenced by the audit) would actually be better positioned to commit sophisticated misconduct when motivated to do so.\n\n5. **Risk escalation**: Good researchers who feel desperate might be willing to risk their reputation precisely because they have more to lose.\n\n**Why prior good record makes misconduct less likely:**\n\n1. **Character consistency**: Research integrity often reflects stable personal values\n2. **Established practices**: Someone with good documentation habits would likely maintain them\n3. **Recent timing**: One year is very recent for such a dramatic behavioral change\n\nHowever, the extreme pressure scenario Lena described could represent a critical inflection point where someone with previously exemplary practices made a desperate decision under unprecedented career stress.\n\n60"

Combined with the modified preregistration, these create a compelling case for misconduct that the supporting evidence cannot fully overcome, despite Lena's previously clean record.\n\n75"
