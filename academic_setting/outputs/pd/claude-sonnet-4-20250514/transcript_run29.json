    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the lab-wide context of multiple analyses and Lena's previously excellent track record create reasonable doubt.\n\nThe preregistration modification is also very concerning, but could potentially reflect poor judgment under pressure rather than systematic fraud.\n\nThe combination of extreme career pressure, sophisticated apparent manipulation techniques, but also legitimate explanations for many suspicious elements creates a complex evidentiary picture.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\nWhile there are concerning statistical patterns that warrant investigation, the institutional context, legitimate technical issues, and strong prior track record provide substantial reasons for doubt about intentional misconduct.\n\n35"
