  "Yes.\n\nThe combination of two critical pieces of evidence makes this conclusion highly probable:\n\n1. **The p-value clustering just below .05 with almost none just above** - this is a classic statistical signature of data manipulation that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\n2. **Post-hoc modification of the preregistration document** - changing both exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection fundamentally violates research integrity principles and suggests deliberate attempt to make manipulated results appear pre-planned.\n\nWhile individual pieces of evidence have potential innocent explanations, these two factors together create a pattern that is very difficult to explain without misconduct. The established motive (extreme pressure regarding grants and career prospects) provides the psychological context for why someone with previously good research practices might cross ethical lines in a high-stakes situation."
