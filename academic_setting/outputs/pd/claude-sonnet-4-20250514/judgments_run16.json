  "Looking at the totality of evidence, I need to weigh the strongest indicators on both sides.\n\nThe most compelling evidence for misconduct is:\n- The p-value clustering just below .05 with virtually none just above - this is a classic statistical signature of data manipulation that is astronomically unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses\n- The modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - this represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles\n\nWhile there is meaningful evidence supporting Lena's innocence (clean audit history, legitimate documented exclusions, verified technical issues, lab-wide analysis practices), the statistical pattern of p-values is so characteristic of manipulation that it's extremely difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nThe combination of modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distributions creates a coherent picture of someone who manipulated data and then adjusted the preregistered plan to match the fabricated results.\n\n**Yes**"
