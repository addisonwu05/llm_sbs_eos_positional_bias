  "Yes.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors (strong prior record, legitimate exclusions, technical problems), the combination of two critical pieces of evidence makes misconduct the most likely explanation:\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection** - This represents a fundamental violation of research integrity that is extremely difficult to justify innocently, especially when it involved changing both exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value clustering just below .05** - This statistical pattern is widely recognized as a hallmark of data manipulation and is extraordinarily unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\nThese two elements, combined with documented extreme pressure/motivation and the anonymous whistleblower's concerns about results being \"too perfect,\" create a compelling case for systematic misconduct despite Lena's previously clean record."
