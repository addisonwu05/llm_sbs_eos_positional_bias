The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The hard drive failure and missing files also suggest that some data might have been lost, leading to these exclusions.\n\nHowever, the presence of suspicious patterns in the dataset and the timing of the changes in the analysis script (after reviewers' comments) do raise concerns.

For example, if the effect sizes are small but consistent, this could lead to a higher concentration of p-values just below .05.\n3. **Statistical Methods**: The choice of statistical methods and the way data are analyzed can sometimes lead to such patterns. For example, certain types of corrections for multiple comparisons or the use of specific statistical tests might produce this result.\n4. **Outlier Handling**: The way outliers or extreme values are handled can also influence the distribution of p-values. If outliers are systematically excluded or adjusted, it could affect the p-value distribution.\n\nHowever, the pattern of p-values is a strong indicator of potential issues, and the absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly suspicious.
