The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

These reasons can include:\n\n1. **Data Quality Issues**: Participants might provide incomplete responses, data might be corrupted, or there might be technical issues with the experimental setup that affect the validity of the data.\n2. **Outliers**: Some participants might have responses that are so extreme that they are considered outliers, which can skew the results. Researchers often exclude such participants to ensure the robustness of the statistical analyses.\n3. **Protocol Deviations**: Participants might not have followed the experimental protocol correctly, leading to data that cannot be reliably used in the analysis.\n4. **Pre-Specified Exclusion Criteria**: Sometimes, exclusion criteria are specified in the study design, and participants who meet these criteria are excluded from the final analysis. For example, participants who do not meet certain performance thresholds or who have known conditions that could interfere with the results might be excluded.\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: If a participant withdraws consent or if there are ethical concerns about the data, they might be excluded.\n\nGiven that Lena has a strong record of careful data handling and the lab recently switched software, which could have introduced new challenges, it is plausible that some participants were excluded for one of the above reasons.

For example, she might have added participants with favorable data and excluded those with unfavorable data to achieve statistically significant results.\n2. **Selective Reporting**: She might have run multiple analyses and chosen to report only those that supported the hypothesis, while excluding participants or data points that did not.\n3. **Data Fabrication**: Lena might have fabricated data for some participants entirely, and then excluded those participants when the fabricated data became suspicious or difficult to justify.\n4. **Post-Hoc Justifications**: She might have excluded participants based on post-hoc criteria that were not pre-specified, which can be a form of p-hacking to achieve desired results.\n\nGiven the context of the whistleblower's concerns and the suspicious patterns in the dataset, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script with more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset, assuming Lena did commit academic misconduct, is quite high.

However, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are some plausible explanations for this phenomenon, though they are less likely:\n\n1. **Random Variation**: While less likely, it is possible that the distribution of p-values just below .05 is a result of random chance. However, the probability of this happening by chance is relatively low, especially if the dataset is large and the number of analyses is substantial.\n\n2. **Power and Effect Size**: If the study has high power and the effect size is just large enough to be significant, it is possible to see a concentration of p-values just below .05. However, this would typically be accompanied by a more even distribution of p-values, not an unusually high concentration.\n\n3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing can sometimes lead to a concentration of p-values. For example, if outliers are systematically removed, it might slightly shift the distribution of p-values. However, this would typically not result in such a pronounced concentration just below .05.\n\n4. **Multiple Comparisons and Bonferroni Corrections**: If multiple comparisons were made and Bonferroni corrections were not applied, this could lead to a higher number of significant p-values. However, this would usually still result in a more even distribution of p-values around the significance threshold.\n\n5. **Publication Bias**: If Lena or the research team is aware of the pressure to produce significant results, they might unconsciously bias their analysis or data selection. This is a form of publication bias and can lead to a concentration of p-values just below .05. However, this is still a form of bias, even if not intentional misconduct.\n\nGiven the unusual pattern of p-values, the likelihood that this concentration is due to random chance or other benign factors is relatively low.

These feelings and concerns are common among researchers, especially early-career researchers like Lena.\n\nHere are some reasons why Lena might have written such emails without engaging in misconduct:\n\n1. **High Stakes**: Academic research often comes with significant pressure to produce positive results. Grant reviews, job prospects, and the continuation of funding can all depend on the success of a study. Lena's statements reflect the real and intense pressure she and her supervisor are under.\n\n2. **Career Concerns**: For a third-year PhD student, the outcome of a high-profile study can have a substantial impact on their career trajectory.

Both of these events can happen for legitimate reasons and are not uncommon in research settings.\n\nHere are several reasons why this is likely:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Labs often switch software packages due to various reasons, such as:\n   - **New Features**: The new software might offer better functionality, more advanced statistical methods, or improved user interfaces.\n   - **Support and Licensing**: The lab might have changed its licensing agreement or found better support with a different software.\n   - **Collaboration**: The lab might be working with collaborators who use a different software, necessitating a switch for compatibility.\n   - **Funding**: New funding might provide resources for better software, or existing funding might require the use of specific tools.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: Hard drive failures are a common technological issue and can happen to anyone. The IT department confirming the hardware failure and repair adds credibility to this event.\n   - **Routine Maintenance**: Hard drives can fail due to age, usage, or other factors, and regular maintenance or replacement is a standard practice.\n   - **Data Backup**: While the failure led to some missing files, it is common for researchers to have multiple backups, which can mitigate the loss of data.\n\n3. **Impact on Files**: The hard drive failure could reasonably lead to the loss of some files, but not necessarily all of them.

They do not necessarily indicate any malicious intent.\n\nGiven the commonality of these issues and the confirmation from the IT department, the likelihood that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, is high.\n\nGiven all these factors, I would estimate the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, to be around 80%.\n\n80"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files. However, these events, while plausible, can also be used to cover up or facilitate misconduct.\n\nHere are several reasons why this is possible, but less likely:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software can be used to obscure or manipulate data. For example:\n   - **Data Manipulation**: Switching to a new software might allow Lena to use different methods or features to manipulate the data more easily.\n   - **File Incompatibility**: The switch could create issues with file compatibility, making it harder to trace the original data and analysis steps.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure can be a convenient explanation for missing or altered files. For example:\n   - **Covering Tracks**: If some files were lost, it could be easier to hide or alter other files without leaving obvious traces.\n   - **Plausible Deniability**: The failure provides a plausible reason for the loss of files that could contain incriminating evidence.\n\n3. **Timing**: If the switch and the hard drive failure occurred at strategic times, it could be used to cover up misconduct. For example:\n   - **Concurrent Events**: If the switch and failure happened around the same time, it could create confusion and make it harder to reconstruct the data and analysis steps.\n\n4. **Independent Events**: While the switch and failure are independent events, they can be used in combination to create a narrative that supports the integrity of the data. However, this does not rule out the possibility of misconduct.\n\n5. **IT Confirmation**: The IT department confirming the hard drive failure adds credibility to the event, but it does not necessarily mean that all other aspects of the data and analysis are above suspicion.\n\nGiven these factors, it is possible that the lab switching software and Lena’s laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure could be used to facilitate or cover up misconduct. However, the probability is lower compared to the scenario where she did not commit misconduct, as these events can be seen as convenient cover-ups.\n\nGiven all these factors, I would estimate the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, to be around 50%.\n\n50"

A strong record of careful data handling and reproducibility in previous work is a strong indicator of consistent ethical and rigorous research practices.\n\nHere are several reasons why this is likely:\n\n1. **Consistency in Practices**: Researchers who are meticulous and ethical in their data handling are likely to maintain these practices across multiple projects. If Lena has a history of well-documented and reproducible research, it suggests a consistent commitment to high standards.\n\n2. **Previous Audits**: The fact that her earlier projects passed an independent data audit and were rated positively indicates that she has been evaluated and found to be following best practices. This is a strong indicator of her reliability and integrity.\n\n3. **Reputation and Trust**: A researcher with a strong reputation for ethical and thorough data management is less likely to engage in misconduct. Her previous ratings suggest that she has earned the trust of her peers and the lab.\n\n4. **Training and Environment**: The lab environment and training she received likely emphasized the importance of data integrity and reproducibility. If her earlier work was well-documented, it suggests that she was well-trained and committed to these principles.\n\n5. **Peer Review and Collaboration**: Positive ratings in previous audits often involve peer review and collaboration, which can further reinforce good practices. If her earlier work was well-received, it suggests that her methods and documentation were reviewed and approved by others.\n\nGiven her strong record of well-documented and reproducible research, the likelihood that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible is very high.\n\nGiven all these factors, I would estimate the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible to be around 95%.\n\n95"

However, it is not impossible, as researchers who engage in misconduct might still maintain high standards in some aspects of their work to avoid detection.\n\nHere are several reasons why this is less likely, but still possible:\n\n1. **Maintaining Appearances**: Researchers who engage in misconduct might still maintain high standards in documentation and reproducibility to avoid suspicion. This can make it harder to detect misconduct during audits.\n\n2. **Selective Misconduct**: Lena might have engaged in misconduct in only one specific study while maintaining high standards in her other work. This could be a strategic approach to avoid raising red flags across all her research.\n\n3. **Prior Experience**: If she had not engaged in misconduct in her earlier work, she might have a genuine record of good practices. The current misconduct could be a recent or isolated incident.\n\n4. **Lab Environment**: The lab's culture and standards might have influenced her to maintain high standards in her earlier work, even if she later engaged in misconduct. If the lab has strong oversight and norms, it can reduce the likelihood of widespread misconduct.\n\n5. **Luck and Chance**: It is possible that the earlier audits did not detect any issues due to chance or the specific focus of the audit. Audits are not infallible and might not catch every instance of misconduct.\n\nHowever, the strong positive ratings from previous audits and the well-documented and reproducible nature of her earlier work suggest that she had a genuine commitment to these standards. Engaging in misconduct while maintaining such a record is less likely but not impossible.\n\nGiven all these factors, I would estimate the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible to be围绕 40%.\n\n40"

Let's summarize the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of P-Values Just Below .05**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 20%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 90%\n   - **Implication**: This is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document After Data Collection**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 30%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 85%\n   - **Implication**: Modifying preregistration after data collection is a significant red flag for misconduct.\n\n3. **Emails Expressing High Stakes**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 70%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 90%\n   - **Implication**: High pressure can be a motivator for misconduct, but it also reflects the high stakes in academic research.\n\n4. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 85%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 60%\n   - **Implication**: Running multiple scripts can be a legitimate robustness check, but it can also be used to mask manipulation.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Participants Based on Notes Preceding Submission**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 90%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 60%\n   - **Implication**: Legitimate exclusions are common, but they can also be used to justify other manipulations.\n\n6. **Lab Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 80%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 50%\n   - **Implication**: These events can happen independently but can also be used to cover up misconduct.\n\n7. **No Prior Record of Data Irregularities**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: 95%\n   - **If Misconduct**: 40%\n   - **Implication**: A strong record of reproducibility and well-documented research is a positive indicator against misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence suggests a mix of high-risk and low-risk factors. The unusually high concentration of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document are particularly concerning. These are strong indicators of potential misconduct. However, the presence of legitimate robustness checks, the exclusion of participants with valid reasons, and her strong record of reproducibility in previous work provide some balance.\n\nWeighing all these factors, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be around 65%.\n\n65"
