The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena's emails to her friend indicate a high level of personal and professional pressure. It is not uncommon for researchers, especially those in the early stages of their careers, to feel intense pressure to produce positive results. Statements like \"my supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant\" and \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" reflect the real and significant stakes involved in high-profile research. The sentiment that she \"needs this one to work\" is also a common expression of the anxiety and stress associated with such high expectations.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still quite plausible that she would write such emails. The pressure to succeed, combined with the personal and professional consequences of failure, can lead to very candid and emotional expressions of concern. These emails could be a reflection of her genuine fears and the stressful environment in which she is working, rather than an indication of an intention to manipulate data.\n\nGiven the context, it is likely that Lena could have written these emails without any intention to commit misconduct. The probability that Lena would write such emails, assuming she did not commit academic misconduct, is around 70%.\n\n70"

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Emotional Expression**: Even if Lena fabricated or manipulated data, she would still feel the emotional and professional pressure described in the emails. The high stakes and the consequences of a null result would be very real to her, and she might genuinely feel the need to vent these concerns to a trusted friend.\n\n2. **Plausibility**: Expressing the pressure and personal stakes would make her actions, if she did commit misconduct, seem more understandable and less calculated. This could be a way to rationalize her actions to herself and to others.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks**: Lena might believe that expressing the pressure and stakes would make any irregularities in the data seem like honest mistakes rather than intentional fraud. This could be a subconscious or deliberate strategy to mitigate potential suspicions.\n\n4. **Human Behavior**: People who engage in misconduct often still experience and articulate genuine stress and fear, even if they are complicit in wrongdoing.

For example, participants who did not follow instructions, who dropped out of the study, or whose data contain excessive noise or outliers might be excluded to ensure the integrity of the results.\n\n2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The initial dataset might have included all participants, but as the analysis progressed, certain inclusion criteria were applied that led to the exclusion of some participants. These criteria could be based on demographic factors, performance on the task, or other relevant variables.\n\n3. **Preliminary Analyses**: Researchers often run preliminary analyses to get a sense of the data and make informed decisions about how to proceed. The initial script might have included all participants, but after reviewing the results, certain participants were excluded for more refined analyses.\n\n4. **Software and Methodological Adjustments**: The lab recently switched software, which could lead to changes in how data are processed and analyzed. Adjustments in the analysis pipeline might result in the exclusion of participants who do not meet new criteria or whose data are not compatible with the new software.\n\n5. **Ethical and Practical Considerations**: Sometimes, ethical or practical considerations might lead to the exclusion of participants.

After analyzing the data, if the results were not as strong or significant as desired, she could have selectively excluded certain participants to achieve more favorable outcomes. This could involve removing participants with data that did not support the hypothesis or that introduced noise into the analysis.\n\n2. **Covering Tracks**: By including more participants in an earlier version of the script, Lena could create a plausible narrative that the exclusions were part of standard data cleaning or quality control processes. This could make it more difficult for others to detect intentional manipulation.\n\n3. **Iterative Analysis**: Even if the final dataset was manipulated, Lena might have gone through multiple iterations of the analysis, each time refining the dataset to meet the desired results. The earlier versions of the script would naturally include more participants before the selective exclusions were made.\n\n4. **Testing Different Scenarios**: Lena might have tested different scenarios and datasets to see which one yielded the strongest support for the theory. The process of testing and refining the dataset could naturally lead to the exclusion of certain participants in the final version.\n\n5. **Response to Reviewer Comments**: If the study was reviewed and received comments that suggested the data were not robust enough, Lena might have excluded participants in response to these comments to strengthen the results.

Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomaly**: While it is possible for such a pattern to occur by chance, it is statistically unusual. In a large dataset with multiple analyses, p-values should be distributed more evenly around the .05 threshold. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 can be a red flag for potential manipulation or bias.\n\n2. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses often involve multiple tests, and the distribution of p-values should reflect the natural variability of the data. A concentration of p-values just below .05 suggests that the results might have been selectively reported or analyzed to achieve statistical significance.\n\n3. **Publication Bias**: There can be an implicit or explicit bias towards reporting significant results (p < .05) in academic settings, but this bias alone is unlikely to create such a pronounced and unusual pattern in the data.\n\n4. **Data Characteristics**: Some data characteristics might lead to a higher concentration of p-values below .05, but it would be unusual for these characteristics to produce such a striking pattern across multiple exploratory analyses.\n\n5. **Honest Mistakes**: While honest mistakes can occur in data analysis, they are unlikely to result in a consistent pattern of p-values just below .05.

Even if she engaged in misconduct, she might continue to document her decisions to maintain the appearance of following best practices.\n\n5. **Plausible Deniability**: Pre-existing notes can provide a layer of plausible deniability. If questioned, Lena could point to these notes as evidence that the exclusions were made for valid reasons and not to manipulate the results.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is possible that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission if Lena did commit academic misconduct. However, the likelihood is lower compared to if she did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, assuming Lena did commit academic misconduct, is around 60%.\n\n60"

Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Robustness Checks**: Running multiple alternative analysis scripts is a common practice in research to ensure the robustness of the results. This involves testing different exclusion criteria, analysis methods, and model specifications to see if the findings hold up under various conditions.\n\n2. **Lab-Wide Practice**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that this is a standard practice in the lab. It indicates a culture of thorough and transparent data analysis, which Lena would likely follow.\n\n3. **Best Practices**: Exploring robustness is considered a best practice in scientific research. It helps to build confidence in the results and addresses potential criticisms or alternative explanations.\n\n4. **Transparency**: Storing and documenting multiple analysis scripts is a sign of good data management and transparency. It shows that Lena is keeping a detailed record of her analysis steps, which is important for reproducibility and peer review.\n\n5. **Exploratory Analysis**: In exploratory research, it is common to try different approaches to understand the data better. This can include testing different exclusion criteria to ensure that the results are not unduly influenced by specific choices.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is very likely that the lab’s data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe probability that the lab’s data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is around 90%.\n\n90"

However, the likelihood is lower, and such behavior could be part of a strategy to obscure or justify the misconduct. Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Cover for Manipulation**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts could be a way to create a cover for data manipulation. By showing a range of analyses, Lena might try to make her final choices seem more robust and less suspicious.\n\n2. **Exploratory Justification**: If Lena was engaging in p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation, she could use the multiple analyses to justify her final choices as part of a thorough exploratory process, rather than as an attempt to manipulate the results.\n\n3. **Lab-Wide Practice**: If other students in the lab show similar patterns, Lena might have followed this practice to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. Conforming to the lab’s norms could help to mask her misconduct.\n\n4. **Hedging Bets**: Running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria could be a way to hedge her bets, allowing her to choose the analysis that produces the most favorable results. This could be particularly useful if she was under pressure to produce significant findings.\n\n5. **Plausible Deniability**: Having multiple scripts and detailed logs can provide a layer of plausible deniability.

Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Emails to a Friend**: Lena expressed significant pressure and the need for the study to work, which could be a motive for misconduct.\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which is highly suspicious and often a red flag for misconduct.\n3. **Concentration of P-Values**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is highly unusual and suggestive of p-hacking or other forms of manipulation.\n4. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: While these events can happen independently, they could be used to cover up misconduct.\n5. **Exclusion of Participants**: Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes is consistent with standard practices, but it could also be a cover for manipulation.\n6. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running multiple alternative analysis scripts is a common practice and can be a cover for selective reporting or p-hacking.\n\nConsidering these points, the evidence of potential misconduct is strong, particularly the concentration of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document. However, there are also plausible explanations for some of the other issues, such as the lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses and the pressure described in the emails.\n\nGiven the balance of the evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 70%.\n\n70"
