  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis, I think Lena likely committed academic misconduct.\n\n**Answer: Yes**\n\nThe key factors that lead to this conclusion are the unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the emails expressing high pressure and personal stakes. These factors, while not conclusive on their own, collectively suggest a higher probability of misconduct."
