The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, it's important to consider several factors that could also explain this pattern without involving intentional misconduct.\n\n1. **Multiple Testing and P-hacking**: When researchers run multiple analyses and select only the most significant results, this can lead to an accumulation of p-values just below the threshold. This practice, known as p-hacking, can occur without the intent to deceive, but it still inflates the type I error rate.\n\n2. **Data Peeking and Optional Stopping**: Repeatedly checking data during the data collection process and deciding whether to continue based on the interim results can also lead to an excess of p-values just below 0.05. This is another form of fragile research practice that doesn't necessarily imply deliberate fraud.\n\n3. **Publication Bias**: Researchers might be more likely to report and submit results with p-values just below 0.05, even if they didn't manipulate the data. This can create a skewed distribution in the published literature.\n\n4. **Statistical Artifacts**: Certain statistical methods or software can sometimes produce p-values that cluster around certain values, which might not be indicative of misconduct but rather a byproduct of the analysis techniques used.\n\n5. **Random Variation**: Sometimes, unusual patterns can occur due to random chance alone, especially in large datasets or when multiple analyses are conducted.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the pattern of p-values is concerning and warrants further investigation, it is not definitive proof of intentional manipulation. It is possible that the pattern could arise from a combination of the above factors.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below 0.05 and very few just above 0.05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is around 30.\n\n30"

These feelings of pressure and the need for success can be genuine and are often a reality in the highly competitive academic environment.\n\n1. **High Stakes for Supervisor and Lab**: It is common for researchers to feel that their work is crucial for the success of their lab and their supervisor's funding. The pressure to produce publishable results can be intense, especially when a major grant review is pending.\n\n2. **Career Implications**: The impact of a null result on a researcher's career prospects is a legitimate concern. A lack of significant findings can affect job opportunities, especially for those in competitive fields like cognitive neuroscience.\n\n3. **Personal Motivation**: Expressing a strong desire for a study to work and acknowledging the personal stakes involved is a natural and human reaction to the pressures of academic research.\n\nGiven these factors, it is quite likely that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct.

Here are several reasons why this is plausible:\n\n1. **Pressure and Motivation**: The high pressure and the significant consequences of a null result are genuine concerns that can drive someone to engage in misconduct.

This environment is likely to reinforce good research practices.\n\n4. **Reputation and Incentives**: Researchers with a strong reputation for producing well-documented and reproducible data have a vested interest in maintaining that reputation. The incentives to continue these practices are high, both for personal and professional reasons.\n\n5. **No Record of Irregularities**: The absence of any prior data irregularities in previous studies further supports the likelihood that Lena would maintain high standards in her research.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is around 95.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is less likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible. However, it is not impossible, as researchers who engage in misconduct can sometimes maintain a facade of good practice. Here are several reasons why this is less likely, but still possible:\n\n1. **Pattern of Behavior**: If Lena engaged in misconduct in the current study, it is less likely that she would have consistently maintained high standards in all previous studies. Consistent misconduct would be more difficult to hide over multiple projects.\n\n2. **Skill in Deception**: Researchers who are adept at misconduct might also be skilled at maintaining the appearance of good data management and documentation. They might have taken extra steps to ensure their previous studies passed scrutiny.\n\n3. **Selective Misconduct**: It is possible that Lena only engaged in misconduct for this particular high-stakes study and maintained high standards in previous, lower-stakes projects. This would explain why her previous work passed audits.\n\n4. **Lab Environment**: The lab's culture of rigor and transparency might have influenced her to maintain high standards in her earlier work, even if she was tempted to manipulate data in the current study due to high pressure.\n\n5. **Reputation Management**: Lena might have a strong incentive to maintain a good reputation in her earlier work to build a foundation of trust and credibility, which she could leverage to mask misconduct in later projects.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is around 40.\n\n40"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is a complex assessment that involves weighing multiple factors. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **High Concentration of p-values just below 0.05**: This pattern is highly suggestive of p-hacking or data manipulation. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of this pattern occurring is low (30). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is high (85).\n\n2. **Emails Expressing Pressure and Need for Results**: These emails reflect the high stakes and pressure Lena was under, which can drive misconduct. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of writing such emails is moderate (70). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is high (85).\n\n3. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: Post hoc modifications to the preregistration document are a serious red flag. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of such modifications is low (20). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is high (90).\n\n4. **Missing Participants in Final Dataset**: Exclusion of participants based on notes predated the journal submission, which can be legitimate. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of this is high (90). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is moderate (60).\n\n5. **Lab Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**: These events can be coincidental and legitimate. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of these events occurring is moderate (50). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is also moderate (70).\n\n6. **Previous Studies Passing Independent Data Audit**: Her previous work being well-documented and reproducible suggests a history of good practices. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of passing audits is high (95). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is lower (40).\n\n7. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**: Running multiple analyses is a standard practice. If she did not commit misconduct, the probability of this is high (85). If she did commit misconduct, the probability is moderate (70).\n\nGiven these factors, the evidence suggests a significant possibility of misconduct, but it is not definitive. The combination of the p-value pattern, modification of the preregistration, and the high stakes expressed in her emails are particularly concerning. However, the presence of legitimate explanations for some of the issues (e.g., missing participants, software switch, hard drive failure) and her strong record of previous good practices adds complexity.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 65.\n\n65"

However, the evidence is not definitive, and there are plausible explanations for some of the irregularities that do not necessarily involve misconduct.\n\nGiven the high concentration of p-values just below 0.05, the modification of the preregistration document, and the high stakes expressed in her emails, the likelihood of misconduct is substantial. However, the presence of legitimate explanations for some issues and her strong record of previous good practices introduce a degree of uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is:\n\nYes, I think Lena committed academic misconduct, but this conclusion is based on a probability and not absolute certainty.\n\n65"
