  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, the probability that Alex broke the printer is 50%, which indicates that it is equally likely that he did or did not break the printer. Given this 50-50 probability, I cannot definitively conclude whether Alex broke the printer or not.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: **No**.\n\nThis means that, based on the available evidence, I do not think there is enough certainty to conclude that Alex broke the printer."
