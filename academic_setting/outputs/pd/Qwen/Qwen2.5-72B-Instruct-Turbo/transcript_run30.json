The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "In the context of Lena's case, it is important to consider several factors that could explain the exclusion of participants from the final dataset, even if no academic misconduct occurred. Here are some potential reasons:\n\n1. **Data Quality Issues**: Some participants' data might have been excluded due to poor quality, such as technical problems with the recording equipment, participant non-compliance, or data corruption. These issues are common in cognitive neuroscience studies and are often dealt with by excluding problematic participants.\n\n2. **Outliers and Anomalies**: Data from certain participants might have been identified as outliers or anomalies during the analysis, leading to their exclusion. Outliers can significantly affect statistical results, and it is standard practice to remove them to ensure the integrity of the findings.\n\n3. **Inclusion Criteria**: The inclusion criteria for the study might have been refined after the initial analysis, leading to the exclusion of participants who did not meet the updated criteria. This can happen as researchers gain a better understanding of the data and the specific requirements of the study.\n\n4. **Statistical Adjustments**: The exclusion of participants might have been a result of statistical adjustments or corrections, such as removing participants whose data did not conform to the assumptions of the statistical tests being used.\n\n5. **Ethical and Statistical Considerations**: Sometimes, participants need to be excluded for ethical reasons, such as if they were found to have misunderstood the instructions or if their participation was compromised in some way.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is not uncommon for researchers to exclude participants from the final dataset. While the exclusion of participants should be transparent and well-documented, the presence of excluded participants in an earlier version of the analysis script does not necessarily indicate misconduct. It is a standard practice to refine the dataset as more information becomes available and as the analysis progresses.\n\nHowever, the context of the whistleblower's allegations and the internal inquiry adds complexity. The presence of multiple suspicious patterns in the dataset and analysis history, combined with the missing files and software changes, makes it more challenging to rule out the possibility of misconduct. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence of intentional manipulation, it is still possible that the exclusions were due to honest mistakes or routine data processing.\n\nGiven the information provided, and considering both the possibility of legitimate reasons for participant exclusion and the potential for misconduct, I would estimate the probability that the exclusions were a result of honest practices, rather than intentional manipulation, to be **60**.\n\n60"

This can make the results appear more robust and significant, increasing the chances of publication.\n\n2. **Addressing Reviewer Comments**: If reviewers raised concerns about the data or the analysis, Lena might have excluded certain participants to address these comments and align the results more closely with the hypotheses or to eliminate outliers that were causing issues.\n\n3. **Hiding Irregularities**: Excluding participants can be a way to hide data irregularities or inconsistencies that might otherwise raise suspicions. By removing problematic data points, Lena could make the dataset appear more coherent and reliable.\n\n4. **Meeting Publication Standards**: High-profile journals often have stringent criteria for publication, and excluding participants could be a way to meet these standards by tightening the data and making the results more compelling.\n\n5. **Avoiding Rejection**: If the initial dataset included participants that weakened the results, excluding them could be a strategic move to avoid rejection or to respond to reviewers' criticisms effectively.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did engage in academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would have excluded participants to manipulate the results. However, the presence of excluded participants alone is not definitive proof of misconduct, as there can be legitimate reasons for exclusions.

However, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are a few plausible explanations for why the preregistration document might have been modified:\n\n1. **Clarification and Correction**: Mistakes or ambiguities in the initial preregistration might have been identified during the data collection process. Lena might have updated the document to clarify or correct these issues, ensuring that the preregistration accurately reflects the study design and analysis plan.\n\n2. **New Insights**: As the study progressed, new insights or issues might have emerged that necessitated changes to the exclusion criteria or primary outcomes. For example, certain variables might have been found to be problematic or irrelevant, leading to necessary adjustments.\n\n3. **Technical Issues**: There could have been technical issues with the initial preregistration document, such as formatting problems or missing information, which required corrections after data collection was complete.\n\n4. **Collaborative Input**: Feedback from collaborators or the research team might have led to necessary changes. Sometimes, discussions and reviews during the data analysis phase can highlight areas that need to be adjusted in the preregistration.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Ethical concerns or participant welfare issues might have arisen during the study, leading to changes in the exclusion criteria to ensure the well-being of participants.\n\n6. **Software or Methodological Updates**: The lab might have updated its software or methodologies during the study, leading to changes in how the data were processed or analyzed, which might require updates to the preregistration.\n\nWhile these explanations are possible, they are not common practices and can be seen as problematic. Modifying a preregistration document after data collection compromises the preregistration's primary purpose, which is to prevent researcher degrees of freedom and ensure transparency. Therefore, the likelihood of such modifications being due to honest mistakes or legitimate reasons is relatively low, especially in the context of the current concerns and the internal inquiry.\n\nGiven the context and the potential for these explanations, I would estimate the probability that the modifications to the preregistration document were due to honest mistakes or legitimate reasons, rather than academic misconduct, to be **30**.\n\n30"

This is a strong indicator of her reliability and adherence to scientific standards.\n\n2. **Well-Documented and Reproducible Work**: The fact that her raw data and scripts for earlier projects were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggests that she has a strong understanding of best practices in data management and analysis. This level of documentation and reproducibility is typically associated with researchers who follow standard ethical guidelines.\n\n3. **Reputation and Trust**: A consistent record of well-documented and reproducible work builds a reputation of trust and reliability. It is less likely that a researcher with such a strong track record would suddenly engage in misconduct, as it would be out of character and risk their established reputation.\n\n4. **Lab Environment**: The lab's previous data audit and the high standards set by the lab environment suggest that there are robust systems in place to ensure data integrity.

This additional layer of scrutiny makes it less likely that any irregularities would go unnoticed.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly likely that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, to be **95**.\n\n95"

Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Isolated Incident**: It is possible that the misconduct in the current study is an isolated incident. Lena might have maintained high standards in her previous work but made a decision to engage in misconduct under the specific pressures of this high-profile study.\n\n2. **Gradual Deterioration**: Researchers who engage in misconduct might start with small infractions and gradually escalate. Lena's previous work might have been genuinely well-documented and reproducible, but she could have been influenced by increasing pressures and ethical lapses over time.\n\n3. **Strategic Behavior**: If Lena was planning to commit misconduct in the current study, she might have taken extra care to ensure that her previous work was above reproach to build a strong reputation and reduce suspicion.\n\n4. **Different Context**: The current study might have unique pressures (e.g., grant funding, career advancement) that were not as prominent in her previous work. These pressures could have driven her to take unethical actions in this specific instance.\n\n5. **Peer and Supervisor Oversight**: The positive ratings from the independent data audit and the well-documented nature of her previous work suggest that her peers and supervisors found her methods to be sound. This could indicate that any misconduct in the current study was not a reflection of her usual practices.\n\nHowever, the fact that her previous work passed an independent data audit and was rated highly does make it less likely that she would engage in misconduct. The strong track record of ethical behavior and high standards in her earlier work would need a compelling explanation for why she would deviate in this case.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, to be **40**.\n\n40"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is very likely that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students. Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Standard Practice**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts is a standard practice in many research settings, especially in fields like cognitive neuroscience where robustness checks are important. This practice helps researchers understand how sensitive their results are to different analysis choices.\n\n2. **Lab-Wide Norms**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that this is a common and accepted practice within the lab. It indicates a culture that values thorough and transparent data analysis.\n\n3. **Robustness Checks**: Exploring robustness by varying exclusion criteria and analysis methods is a key aspect of ensuring the reliability and validity of research findings. It is a responsible and ethical approach to data analysis.\n\n4. **Transparency and Reproducibility**: Storing multiple scripts and documenting different analysis choices enhances transparency and reproducibility. It allows other researchers to verify the robustness of the results and understand the impact of different methodological decisions.\n\n5. **Peer and Supervisor Oversight**: The lab’s environment, where such practices are common, suggests that peer and supervisor oversight is in place to ensure high standards of data management and analysis. This reduces the likelihood of misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly likely that Lena would engage in these practices as part of her standard research workflow, especially if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate the probability that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, to be **90**.\n\n90"

Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Covering Tracks**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts can be a way to cover up misconduct. By showing a thorough exploration of different methods, Lena could create the appearance of robustness and transparency, making it harder to detect any manipulations.\n\n2. **Plausible Deniability**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, having multiple scripts can provide plausible deniability. She could argue that the different scripts were part of a thorough exploration of the data, which is a standard practice in the lab.\n\n3. **Consistency with Lab Norms**: Since other students in the lab show similar patterns, it is easier for Lena to blend in and avoid raising suspicion. If running and storing multiple scripts is a common practice, it provides a contextual cover for her actions.\n\n4. **Exploring Different Scenarios**: Even with the intent to manipulate results, Lena might still explore different scenarios to find the most favorable outcome. This could involve running and storing multiple scripts to identify the analysis that best supports her desired results.\n\n5. **Part of a Broader Strategy**: Lena might have a broader strategy to ensure her actions appear legitimate. She could have planned to run and store multiple scripts as part of this strategy, making it seem like she was following standard research practices.\n\nHowever, while these factors make it plausible that she would run and store multiple scripts, the high pressure and stakes of the current study, combined with the other suspicious elements, suggest that the likelihood is not as high as if she did not commit misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate the probability that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, to be **70**.\n\n70"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is influenced by several factors that both support and mitigate the likelihood of misconduct. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**: This is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation. The pattern is highly suspicious and strongly suggests misconduct.\n\n2. **Preregistration Document Modifications**: Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag. While it could be due to legitimate reasons, the context of the other evidence makes this more likely to be misconduct.\n\n3. **Emails Expressing High Pressure**: The emails indicate significant pressure and motivation to produce significant results. While pressure alone does not prove misconduct, it provides a strong motive.\n\n4. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: While these events are plausible and can happen independently, they can also provide convenient cover for misconduct. The combination of these events with other suspicious patterns increases the likelihood of misconduct.\n\n5. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**: Running and storing multiple scripts is a standard practice and can be a way to cover up misconduct. The lab’s norms support this practice, but the context of the other evidence makes it more likely to be part of a strategy to appear legitimate.\n\n6. **No Prior Record of Misconduct**: Lena’s previous work was well-documented and reproducible, and she passed an independent data audit. This provides a strong counter-argument against misconduct, suggesting that her actions in the current study might be an isolated incident.\n\n7. **Consistent Exclusions for Valid Reasons**: The exclusion of participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes predating the journal submission, is a supportive factor for her not committing misconduct.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, the evidence points towards a significant probability of misconduct, but the strong track record of her previous work and the legitimate explanations for some of the events reduce the certainty.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be **75**.\n\n75"
