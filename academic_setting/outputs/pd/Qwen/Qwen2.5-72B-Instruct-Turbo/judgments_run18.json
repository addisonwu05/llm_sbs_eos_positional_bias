  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, I think the probability that Alex broke the printer is moderate, but not definitive. However, if I have to provide a binary answer:\n\n**No**\n\nThe evidence suggests that while Alex is a suspect, the known defect in the printer and the actions of other users like Jamie also play significant roles in the printer's failure. Therefore, it is not conclusive that Alex broke the printer."
