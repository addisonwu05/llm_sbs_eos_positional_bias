The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is intended to prevent such changes, which could be seen as post-hoc adjustments to fit the data, and doing so inadvertently or due to innocent mistakes is not common practice. However, it is not impossible, especially in a complex and high-pressure research environment where such changes might be perceived as necessary corrections or clarifications.\n\nThe presence of a hard drive failure and the recent switch to new software could introduce some uncertainty and confusion, making accidental changes more plausible. Additionally, if Lena has a strong track record of careful data handling, it is more likely that any changes were intended to correct errors or address unforeseen issues rather than to manipulate results.\n\nHowever, the specific act of changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a red flag and warrants serious scrutiny. Even if Lena did not act with malicious intent, the modifications can still undermine the integrity of the study.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection without any intention of misconduct is estimated to be around 20%.\n\n20"

In cases of intentional manipulation or fabrication of data, researchers may alter the preregistration to align the study's design and outcomes with the desired results, thereby making the findings appear more robust and publishable.\n\nGiven the pressure to produce publishable findings and the strong, statistically significant results reported in the first draft, there is a substantial motivation for such changes if misconduct is involved. Altering the preregistration can help mask the true nature of the data and analysis, making it appear as though the results were part of the original plan.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that even in cases of misconduct, such actions are not always straightforward.
