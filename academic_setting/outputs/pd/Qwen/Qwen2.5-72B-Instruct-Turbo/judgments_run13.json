  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis, I think Lena likely committed academic misconduct.\n\n**Yes**\n\nThe combination of significant red flags, such as the modification of the preregistration document and the unusual pattern of p-values, along with the high stakes expressed in her emails, suggests a strong possibility of misconduct. While there are some pieces of evidence that support her innocence, the overall pattern of the evidence points toward a higher likelihood of misconduct."
