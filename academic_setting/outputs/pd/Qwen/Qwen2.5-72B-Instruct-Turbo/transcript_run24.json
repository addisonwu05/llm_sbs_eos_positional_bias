The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Statements like “counting on this study to save the grant,” “a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,” and “I need this one to work” reflect the high stakes and personal investment Lena had in the success of the study. Given the high-pressure environment and the importance of the study, it is quite plausible that Lena would express such sentiments to a friend. These statements do not necessarily indicate an intention to commit misconduct; rather, they highlight the stress and expectations she was facing.\n\nIt is common for researchers, especially those early in their careers, to feel intense pressure to produce successful results to secure funding and career opportunities. This pressure can lead to heightened emotional and professional stakes, which might be naturally expressed in personal communications. Therefore, even if Lena is innocent of any misconduct, it is highly likely that she would express the level of pressure and the importance of the study in such a way.\n\nGiven this context, I would estimate the likelihood of Lena writing such emails, if she did not commit academic misconduct, to be around 80.\n\n80"

These factors include her psychological state, her awareness of the potential consequences, and her risk tolerance.\n\n1. **Psychological State**: If Lena felt cornered or desperate due to the high stakes, she might have been more likely to express her stress and the importance of the study. This could be a way to rationalize her actions or to vent her frustrations to a trusted friend.\n\n2. **Awareness of Consequences**: If Lena was aware that her actions could be discovered and the potential consequences were severe, she might have been more cautious about documenting her thoughts and motivations. However, the high pressure and the urgency of the situation might have overridden her caution.\n\n3. **Risk Tolerance**: Some individuals might be more willing to take risks and less concerned about being caught, while others might be more risk-averse. If Lena is willing to commit academic misconduct, she might also be more likely to document her motivations and stress, believing that the risks are worth the potential rewards.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is plausible that Lena, if she did commit misconduct, would still write such emails. The high stakes and the emotional toll of the situation could lead her to express these sentiments, even if it might later be used against her.

This pattern, known as \"p-hacking\" or \"data dredging,\" can occur when researchers engage in practices such as multiple testing, selective reporting, or other forms of data manipulation to achieve statistically significant results.\n\nHowever, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are still a few plausible explanations for this pattern:\n\n1. **True Effect with Small Sample Size**: If the effect being studied is real but small, and the sample size is relatively small, it is possible to see a clustering of p-values just below .05 due to the statistical power of the tests. Small sample sizes can lead to more variability in p-values, sometimes resulting in a higher concentration around the significance threshold.\n\n2. **Random Variation**: In any dataset, there can be random variations that result in an unusual pattern of p-values. However, this is less likely to produce a consistent pattern of p-values just below .05 across multiple analyses.\n\n3. **Analytical Choices**: Certain analytical choices, such as the use of specific statistical methods or the way data are preprocessed, can sometimes lead to an increased likelihood of p-values clustering near the significance threshold. For example, using multiple comparison corrections or conducting exploratory analyses can affect the distribution of p-values.\n\n4. **Publication Bias**: If the field has a strong publication bias favoring significant results, researchers might inadvertently or unconsciously make choices that lead to more significant findings. This can contribute to a higher concentration of p-values just below .05.\n\nDespite these explanations, the pattern of p-values just below .05 is still unusual and raises significant red flags. In the absence of misconduct, the likelihood of this pattern occurring naturally is relatively low, but not impossible.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would estimate the likelihood of the final dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, to be around 20.\n\n20"

This pattern is a common indicator of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation, where researchers may selectively report or adjust data to achieve statistically significant results.\n\nHere are the reasons why this pattern is more likely if misconduct occurred:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: One common form of misconduct is p-hacking, where researchers perform multiple analyses and selectively report only those that yield significant results. This can lead to a clustering of p-values just below the conventional .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Data Falsification**: If Lena intentionally altered data to make results appear significant, she might have adjusted the data to push p-values just below .05. This could involve changing individual data points or selectively including or excluding data points to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Another form of misconduct is selectively reporting only the analyses that yield significant results and omitting those that do not. This can also lead to a higher concentration of p-values just below .05.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**: Given the high stakes and pressure described (e.g., the supervisor counting on the study, Lena's postdoc chances), there would be a strong motivation to manipulate the data to achieve significant results.

It demonstrates a commitment to thorough and rigorous scientific methods.\n\n5. **Peer Influence**: If other students in the lab are engaging in similar practices, it is likely that Lena, as a member of the lab, would follow these norms to maintain consistency and meet the lab's standards.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the lab's data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if she did not commit academic misconduct, is very high.\n\n90\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students. However, the likelihood is lower for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Covering Tracks**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts could be a way for Lena to cover her tracks and make it appear as if she was thoroughly exploring the robustness of her findings. This could make it harder to detect any manipulations.\n\n2. **Standard Practice**: If multiple students in the lab are engaging in this practice, it might be a standard procedure that Lena followed to fit in with the lab's norms. This could provide a cover for her misconduct by making her behavior consistent with others.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Lena might have run multiple analyses to find the most favorable results and then selectively reported those, while still storing the other analyses to maintain an appearance of transparency. This could be a strategy to balance the need for significant results with the need to avoid suspicion.\n\n4. **Skill in Manipulation**: If Lena was skilled at manipulating data, she might have been careful to document her analyses in a way that aligns with standard practices, making it harder to detect any wrongdoing.\n\n5. **Pressure and Motivation**: The high pressure and personal stakes might have driven Lena to take these steps to ensure her results were publishable, while still maintaining the appearance of thoroughness.\n\nHowever, the fact that multiple students in the lab are engaging in this practice reduces the likelihood that Lena's behavior is solely for the purpose of covering up misconduct, as it suggests a broader lab culture of thorough data analysis.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the lab’s data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if she did commit academic misconduct, is moderate but not very high.\n\n60\n\n60"

    "content": "Given the evidence presented, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by weighing the cumulative likelihood of each piece of evidence. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**:\n   - If no misconduct: 20\n   - If misconduct: 85\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document After Data Collection**:\n   - If no misconduct: 30\n   - If misconduct: 85\n\n3. **Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - If no misconduct: 50\n   - If misconduct: 70\n\n4. **Previous Studies Passing Independent Audit**:\n   - If no misconduct: 95\n   - If misconduct: 40\n\n5. **Exclusion of Participants Based on Pre-existing Notes**:\n   - If no misconduct: 85\n   - If misconduct: 60\n\n6. **Running and Storing Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**:\n   - If no misconduct: 90\n   - If misconduct: 60\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**: This is a strong indicator of potential misconduct, as it is highly unusual and often associated with p-hacking.\n- **Modification of Preregistration Document**: Another strong red flag, as it suggests post-hoc changes to the analysis plan.\n- **Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**: While not impossible, these events could be used to cover up misconduct.\n- **Previous Studies Passing Independent Audit**: A strong positive indicator that Lena generally adheres to good practices, which reduces the likelihood of misconduct.\n- **Exclusion of Participants Based on Pre-existing Notes**: This is a reasonable and standard practice, which reduces the likelihood of misconduct in this specific instance.\n- **Running and Storing Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**: This is a standard practice in the lab, which could be used to cover up misconduct but also aligns with good scientific practice.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile there are strong indicators of potential misconduct, such as the high concentration of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, there are also strong indicators that Lena generally adheres to good scientific practices, such as her previous studies passing an independent audit and the standard practice of running multiple analyses.\n\nBalancing these factors, the cumulative evidence suggests a moderate to high probability of misconduct, but not a certainty.\n\nGiven this analysis, I estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be around 70.\n\n70"
