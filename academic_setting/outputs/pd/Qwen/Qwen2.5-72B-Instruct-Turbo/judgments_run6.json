  "Based on the cumulative evidence and the analysis provided, I think there is a significant probability that Lena committed academic misconduct. However, the decision should be based on a thorough investigation by the appropriate authorities.\n\n**My judgment: Yes**. \n\nI believe there is a strong case to suspect that Lena may have committed academic misconduct, given the multiple red flags and the cumulative weight of the evidence. However, a formal investigation is necessary to reach a definitive conclusion."
