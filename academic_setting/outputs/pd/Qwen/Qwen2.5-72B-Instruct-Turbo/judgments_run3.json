  "Based on the given evidence, I think Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n**Yes**\n\nThe key pieces of evidence, particularly the modification of the preregistration document and the unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, are strong indicators of potential misconduct. While there are some factors that could be explained by non-misconduct scenarios, the overall pattern of evidence suggests that Lena likely engaged in academic misconduct."
