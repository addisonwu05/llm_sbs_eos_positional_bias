When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This kind of hyperbolic language is common in workplace settings, especially when dealing with frequently malfunctioning equipment. Coworkers' reaction with laughing emojis further suggests that this was seen as a humorous or lighthearted complaint rather than a serious threat.\n\nThe likelihood that Alex would post such a comment without intending to break the printer is relatively high, as it reflects a common way people express frustration in a non-threatening manner. However, this probability is not 100% because there is always a small chance that such a comment could be a prelude to actual destructive behavior, especially if Alex was under significant stress or had a poor track record with equipment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that Alex would have posted such a comment if they did not break the printer is around 75%.\n\n75"
