  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nWhile there are some suspicious elements like the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and the changing story about printer usage, the weight of evidence points away from Alex being responsible:\n\n1. Alex physically left the building 7 minutes before the printer failed according to electronic logs\n2. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling\n3. Security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier that afternoon\n4. Alex proactively reported concerns about the printer making grinding noises three days before the breakdown\n5. Alex has an established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment issues\n\nThe timing evidence is particularly compelling - Alex couldn't have been physically present when the critical error occurred. Combined with the printer's known defects and alternative potential causes, it seems more likely that the printer failed due to either its documented mechanical issues or damage caused by others like Jamie."
