  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n\n1. The distribution of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold (p < .05) with very few just above it - a statistical pattern highly consistent with data manipulation and extremely unlikely to occur naturally\n\n2. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - a fundamental violation of research integrity principles\n\n3. The combination of career pressure (documented in emails) with the opportunity and means to manipulate analyses (multiple analysis scripts)\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors (previous clean audit, documented legitimate exclusions for some participants), they don't outweigh the strong evidence of p-hacking and inappropriate changes to preregistration.\n\nThe technical issues (software change, hard drive failure) provide plausible explanations for some inconsistencies but also convenient cover for manipulated analyses.\n\nTaken together, the evidence strongly suggests deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results rather than honest reporting of data."
