  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer. The evidence more strongly supports that the printer failed due to its documented mechanical issues and/or Jamie's rough handling rather than deliberate damage by Alex. Alex's proactive reporting of the grinding noise days earlier, consistent history of properly reporting equipment issues, and departure from the building before the error was logged all suggest Alex was not responsible for breaking the printer."
