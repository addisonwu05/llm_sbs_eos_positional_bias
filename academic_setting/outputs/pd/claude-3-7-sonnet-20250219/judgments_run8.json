  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer. The evidence that most strongly supports Alex's innocence is the objective timeline - Alex badged out at 5:12pm while the critical error occurred at 5:19pm, meaning Alex physically couldn't have caused the final failure. Combined with the printer's documented history of similar failures in other departments, Jamie's observed forceful handling captured on security footage, and Alex's proactive reporting of issues days earlier, the most reasonable conclusion is that Alex did not break the printer. While some circumstantial evidence exists (plastic fragments, contradictory statements), these can be explained by earlier interactions with an already-malfunctioning printer, and they're outweighed by the objective timeline and pattern of mechanical defects."
