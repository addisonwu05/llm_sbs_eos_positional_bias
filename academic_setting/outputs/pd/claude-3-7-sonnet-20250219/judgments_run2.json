  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence against Alex's culpability is that he physically left the building 7 minutes before the critical error occurred, as confirmed by both building access logs and the printer's error log. This timing makes it impossible for Alex to have been directly involved in the final breakdown.\n\nAdditionally, security footage shows another coworker (Jamie) roughly handling the printer as the last clearly visible person before the failure, providing a direct alternative explanation for the damage.\n\nThe printer model has a documented history of identical failures in other departments without any mishandling, and Alex professionally reported concerns about the printer days earlier, which is inconsistent with someone planning to damage equipment.\n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence might raise questions (like Alex's frustration and the plastic fragments), the objective evidence of timing, security footage, and the printer's known technical issues all point to Alex not being responsible for breaking the printer."
