  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection\n- The statistically suspicious pattern of p-values clustered just below .05\n- Evidence of selective participant exclusion between analysis versions\n- Her emails indicating pressure and motivation for positive results\n\nWhile some factors like her previous good record and some legitimate exclusions provide context, they don't adequately explain the most concerning patterns in the data. The modification of the preregistration document is particularly difficult to justify through innocent means.\n\nTherefore, my judgment is: Yes"
