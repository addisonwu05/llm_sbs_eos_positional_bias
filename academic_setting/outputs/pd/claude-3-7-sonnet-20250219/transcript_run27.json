Ongoing printer issues: The printer had been jamming repeatedly throughout the day, which might cause users to spend more time at the printer trying to resolve issues.\n\n3.

Confusion about timeframe: Alex might have been thinking about afternoon usage when first asked (when the printer broke) and then remembered a morning print job.\n\n4.

This is a common first reaction when someone has done something wrong - complete denial.\n\n2. Strategic adjustment: After realizing that complete denial might not be credible (especially if Alex frequently uses the printer or was seen near it), they offered a limited admission about morning use.

Minimizing involvement: By specifically placing their printer use in the morning, Alex creates temporal distance from the afternoon breakdown, suggesting they couldn't have been responsible.\n\n4.

Absence of mishandling: The critical point is that the previous failures occurred \"without any evidence of improper handling,\" indicating the printer can and does fail on its own without user misuse.\n\n5. Recent timeframe: These other failures happened \"in the last six months,\" establishing this as an ongoing, current issue with this model.\n\nIf Alex didn't break the printer, we would expect exactly this kind of evidence - documentation showing the same printer model fails in the same way even without mishandling. This creates a clear alternative explanation for why the printer broke that doesn't involve Alex or any other employee mishandling it.\n\nThis documented history would be very likely to exist if Alex didn't break the printer, as it provides the most straightforward explanation for the failure.\n\n95"

Unrelated background fact: The printer model's general reliability issues could simply be a coincidental background fact that exists independently of what happened in this specific incident. Many office equipment models have known issues regardless of who uses them.\n\n2. Contributor but not sole cause: The printer might have underlying design flaws that made it more vulnerable to damage when Alex mishandled it. Equipment with design flaws is often more susceptible to breaking when handled improperly.\n\n3. Similar symptoms, different cause: The printer could display similar error messages and symptoms whether it fails due to inherent defects or due to mishandling. The \"similar way\" of failing might refer to the error messages or visible symptoms rather than the root cause.\n\n4. Confounding factor: This history could make it more difficult to determine causation in any specific case, potentially creating plausible deniability for damage caused by mishandling.\n\n5. Industry-wide context: Many printer models have some documented failure patterns. This information about failure history would likely exist regardless of what happened in this specific incident.\n\nEven if Alex broke this particular printer, the model's general tendency to fail would still exist as an independent fact. The printer can both have design flaws and still be broken by mishandling in a specific instance - these aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nThis information would be expected to exist regardless of whether Alex broke the printer or not, as it relates to the general properties of the printer model rather than this specific incident.\n\n80"

Alex expressed frustration in the team chat, saying they would \"lose it\" if the printer jammed again\n2. A coworker saw Alex near the printer shortly before it stopped working\n3. Alex gave inconsistent statements about using the printer that day\n4. Plastic fragments matching the broken printer tray were found in Alex's trash can\n\nEvidence suggesting Alex did not break the printer:\n1. Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, but the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left\n2. Security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier that afternoon, with Jamie being the last clearly visible person using it\n3. Alex emailed facilities three days earlier about the printer making grinding noises, showing proactive concern\n4. Alex has a history of promptly reporting equipment problems and cooperating with maintenance\n5. The building technician confirmed this printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling, with two similar cases in other departments\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The timing evidence strongly suggests Alex couldn't have caused the final failure (left 7 minutes before)\n- The plastic fragments in Alex's trash are concerning but could be from earlier maintenance\n- Jamie's rough handling provides a plausible alternative cause\n- The printer model's documented failure history provides a mechanical explanation\n- Alex's proactive reporting behavior is inconsistent with someone who would damage equipment\n\nConsidering all evidence holistically, the timeline of Alex's departure combined with the printer model's known issues and Jamie's documented rough handling make it unlikely that Alex broke the printer.\n\n25"
