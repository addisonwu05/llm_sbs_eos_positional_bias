  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe the answer is:\n\nYes\n\nThe pattern of evidence strongly suggests academic misconduct occurred. The most compelling indicators include the unusual clustering of p-values just below significance threshold with few just above, the modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, and the selective participant exclusions that appear to have been made to achieve significant results. While some evidence (like previous good research practices and documented legitimate exclusions) could support innocence, the overall pattern forms a coherent picture of selective reporting and data manipulation that cannot be adequately explained through legitimate research practices or coincidence."
