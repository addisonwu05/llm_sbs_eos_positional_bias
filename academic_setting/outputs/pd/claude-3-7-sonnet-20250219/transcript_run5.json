The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Principal investigators often need positive results to secure continued funding, and everyone in the lab would be aware of this pressure.\n\n2. \"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" - This reflects the publication bias in academia where positive findings are more likely to be published than null results. PhD students are often acutely aware that their job prospects depend on publications.\n\n3. \"I need this one to work\" - This expresses hope for a successful study outcome, which is natural for any researcher who has invested significant time and effort.\n\nThese statements reveal awareness of publication pressures and career concerns, but they don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Researchers can recognize these pressures while still maintaining scientific integrity. The emails show Lena understands the stakes but don't prove she acted unethically.\n\nMany honest researchers would acknowledge similar pressures in private communications. In fact, such candid recognition of systemic pressures is common among academics at all levels.\n\nThe emails indicate anxiety about results but not necessarily an intent to manipulate data.

They establish motive and suggest that result-oriented thinking preceded any data manipulation.\n\nThe emails don't explicitly mention misconduct, which makes them more likely to be written - even someone committing fraud would likely not document it explicitly.

This pattern is important to analyze because:\n\n1. Statistical distribution principles: Under normal statistical processes with no manipulation, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) or a right-skewed distribution (if there are true effects). There should be no discontinuity or clustering specifically around the .05 threshold.\n\n2. Expected randomness: If analyses were conducted honestly without selective reporting or p-hacking, we would expect to see roughly similar numbers of p-values falling just below and just above the .05 significance threshold.\n\n3. The specific anomaly described (many values just below .05, few just above) is precisely the pattern that emerges from questionable research practices such as:\n   - Trying multiple analyses until finding one that \"works\"\n   - Selectively reporting only significant results\n   - Adding subjects until significance is reached\n   - Excluding certain data points to achieve significance\n\nThis pattern has been extensively documented in methodological research as a red flag for potential data manipulation or selective reporting. Meta-analyses of published literature have shown this \"p-value bunching\" is common in fields with publication bias, but rare in honestly reported complete datasets.\n\nEven with researcher degrees of freedom and unconscious biases, the specific pattern of many values just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses without some form of selection or manipulation.\n\nProbability judgment: 15"

Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Threshold-oriented manipulation: When researchers engage in misconduct to produce significant results, they typically aim to get p-values just below the conventional significance threshold of .05. The concentration of values at .047, .049, and .041 is precisely what we would expect from someone manipulating analyses until they cross the significance threshold.\n\n2. Missing just-above values: The notable absence of p-values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .052) is highly indicative of manipulation. In honest research, there should be a continuous distribution across this threshold. The discontinuity strongly suggests that analyses yielding p-values slightly above .05 were either modified until they became significant or simply not reported.\n\n3. Multiple instances: The fact that this pattern appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it even more indicative of systematic manipulation rather than chance.\n\n4. Statistical fingerprint: This specific pattern (clustering just below .05, gap just above) is so well-recognized as a sign of p-hacking or data manipulation that it's often used in forensic analyses of scientific misconduct. Statisticians have developed specific tests to detect this anomaly because it's such a reliable indicator of questionable practices.\n\nThis type of statistical pattern has been consistently found in meta-scientific investigations of fraudulent or manipulated research. It represents exactly the kind of statistical fingerprint that researchers would unintentionally leave when engaging in p-hacking or selective analysis to ensure desired outcomes.\n\nGiven Lena's expressed motivations and the pressure she was under, if she did commit misconduct, this pattern would be an almost inevitable consequence of her attempts to produce significant results.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

Pre-registered exclusion criteria: Researchers often establish criteria before data collection that specify when participants should be excluded (e.g., performance below chance, failure to follow instructions, technical issues). Applying these pre-determined criteria is standard practice.\n\n2. Data quality issues: Researchers may legitimately exclude participants who:\n   - Failed attention or manipulation checks\n   - Had excessive missing data\n   - Showed evidence of not understanding instructions\n   - Had technical problems during testing\n   - Were statistical outliers (with justification)\n\n3. Refining analysis approaches: As research progresses, legitimate methodological improvements might lead to different inclusion criteria. For instance, researchers might realize that certain participants didn't meet inclusion criteria that weren't initially checked.\n\n4. Addressing reviewer feedback: If the paper went through peer review, reviewers may have suggested more stringent inclusion criteria, leading to legitimate participant exclusion.\n\n5. Documentation and transparency: In legitimate cases, researchers typically document exclusions transparently, explaining the rationale and reporting how many participants were excluded for each reason.\n\nThe key factors that would make this scenario more likely to be innocent include:\n- If exclusion criteria were documented and justified\n- If similar numbers of participants were excluded across conditions\n- If exclusions were based on objective criteria rather than their impact on results\n- If the exclusions followed standard practices in the field\n\nParticipant exclusion between analysis versions is a common occurrence in legitimate research, though it should follow methodological best practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

Here's why:\n\n1. Result-driven exclusion: A researcher engaging in misconduct would likely run initial analyses with the full dataset, then strategically remove participants whose data weakened the desired effect or statistical significance. This practice of post-hoc participant selection based on results is a classic form of p-hacking.\n\n2. Undocumented or poorly justified exclusions: If the exclusions lack clear documentation or rely on criteria that weren't pre-registered or are unusual for the field, this suggests they may have been selected to produce favorable outcomes rather than for methodological integrity.\n\n3. Pattern of exclusions: If the excluded participants tend to be those whose data contradicted the hypothesis or reduced statistical significance, this strongly suggests misconduct. Researchers committing fraud typically remove \"inconvenient\" data points.\n\n4. Timing of exclusions: Finding these exclusions in the difference between an early and final version suggests they occurred during analysis rather than during data collection, which is particularly problematic if not transparently reported.\n\n5. Connection to other evidence: Combined with the suspicious p-value distribution (many just below .05, few just above), selective participant exclusion would be a primary mechanism to achieve such a pattern.\n\n6. Concealment: If the earlier version was found in an automated backup rather than being openly preserved and documented, this suggests potential attempts to hide the evolution of the analysis.\n\nSelective participant exclusion is one of the most common methods of data manipulation because it's easier than fabricating data entirely and can be retroactively justified if questioned.

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\nPreregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making decisions about analyses after seeing the data, which can lead to false positive results. The primary purpose of preregistration is to commit to analytical choices before data collection to avoid confirmation bias and p-hacking.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, possible explanations for modifying the preregistration after data collection might include:\n\n1. Administrative errors: Perhaps she was updating documentation and accidentally saved changes to the wrong file.\n\n2. Clarification without substantive changes: She might argue she was only clarifying ambiguities in the original document without changing the actual analysis plan.\n\n3. Documentation of deviations: She could claim she was documenting necessary deviations from the original plan (though this should be done in a separate document, not by modifying the original).\n\n4. Misunderstanding of preregistration: She might have misunderstood the purpose of preregistration, thinking it was acceptable to update it as the study evolved.\n\n5. Technical issues: Perhaps file timestamps were altered due to file system errors or when copying files between devices.\n\nHowever, these explanations are generally weak. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines the integrity of preregistration. This is particularly problematic because these specific changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) are exactly the types of researcher degrees of freedom that preregistration aims to constrain.\n\nIn scientific research, modifying a preregistration after data collection to change these critical elements is widely recognized as improper research practice, even if not done with explicitly fraudulent intent.\n\nProbability judgment: 10"

Here's why:\n\n1. Strategic realignment: Modifying exclusion criteria after seeing the data allows a researcher to selectively remove participants whose data doesn't support the hypothesis. This is one of the most effective ways to manipulate results toward significance when the original analysis doesn't yield the desired outcome.\n\n2. Outcome switching: Changing primary outcomes after seeing results (known as \"HARKing\" - Hypothesizing After Results are Known) allows a researcher to claim they predicted effects that appeared in the data, when in fact they're capitalizing on chance findings. This makes random patterns appear to be confirmations of theory.\n\n3. Creating false documentation: Modifying the preregistration is particularly insidious because it creates a paper trail that appears to legitimize the questionable analyses. It's an attempt to make post-hoc decisions appear to have been made a priori.\n\n4. Concealment of flexibility: This approach conceals researcher degrees of freedom by making it appear that analytical choices were constrained by preregistration when they were actually data-driven.\n\n5. Deliberate action required: Unlike simple reporting errors, modifying a preregistration document requires deliberate action to open, edit, and save changes to a document that should be finalized before data collection begins.\n\nThis behavior directly contradicts the entire purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researchers from making analytical decisions based on the data they observe. Modifying preregistration after seeing the data is recognized in scientific communities as a serious breach of research integrity.\n\nThe fact that timestamps conclusively show this sequence of events makes this particularly damning evidence of intentional misconduct, as it demonstrates awareness of proper procedure (hence the initial preregistration) followed by deliberate circumvention of those safeguards.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

They represent basic quality control that would be implemented regardless of any broader issues with data integrity.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "In evaluating this scenario where Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to consider the context of modern research practices, particularly regarding robustness testing:\n\n1. Robustness analyses as best practice:\n   - Running multiple analyses with varying exclusion criteria has become standard recommended practice in many scientific fields\n   - This approach directly addresses concerns about \"researcher degrees of freedom\" by transparently showing how results change with different analytical choices\n   - Many journals and reviewers now explicitly request robustness checks\n\n2. Lab-wide initiative context:\n   - The fact that this was a \"lab-wide push\" provides important context\n   - Other students showing similar patterns confirms this was an institutional practice, not something unique to Lena\n   - This suggests a lab culture that values methodological rigor and transparency\n\n3. Open Science movement influence:\n   - Many labs have adopted more transparent practices in response to the replication crisis\n   - Storing multiple analysis versions with clear documentation is consistent with modern reproducibility standards\n   - This practice allows others to verify how analytical decisions affect results\n\n4. Educational value:\n   - For PhD students, exploring how different exclusion criteria affect results has pedagogical value\n   - Understanding the robustness of findings across analytical choices is an important research skill\n   - This type of exploration would be encouraged in a quality training environment\n\n5. Legitimate documentation:\n   - The presence of these scripts in official lab data management logs indicates they weren't hidden\n   - Systematic storage suggests organization rather than cherry-picking\n   - The lab appears to have infrastructures supporting transparent analysis tracking\n\nThis pattern of behavior is highly consistent with open, transparent research practices. When conducted systematically and documented properly, multiple analyses exploring different exclusion criteria represent scientific thoroughness rather than p-hacking.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria in the lab's data management logs could still be quite likely, but would take on a different significance:\n\n1. P-hacking under cover of robustness testing:\n   - The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" provides perfect cover for systematically trying different analyses until finding significant results\n   - Running multiple analyses becomes problematic when only favorable outcomes are reported\n   - This environment would allow someone to engage in p-hacking while appearing to follow lab protocols\n\n2. Plausible deniability:\n   - If questioned, having multiple analyses stored allows claiming they were exploratory or sensitivity analyses\n   - The similarity to other students' behavior provides camouflage for questionable practices\n   - It becomes difficult to distinguish legitimate robustness testing from selective reporting\n\n3. Selection without transparency:\n   - The key difference between robustness testing and p-hacking isn't in running multiple analyses, but in how results are selected and reported\n   - Someone could run many analyses, select favorable ones, and present them as the primary or only analyses\n   - The presence of the scripts doesn't tell us whether the selection process was honest\n\n4. Institutional permission structure:\n   - A lab culture encouraging multiple analyses without strict preregistration might inadvertently create conditions where misconduct is easier\n   - The boundary between thorough exploration and p-hacking can become blurred\n   - Other students doing similar work normalizes the behavior\n\n5. Data manipulation logistics:\n   - Having legitimate access to run multiple analyses makes it easier to identify which exclusion criteria produce desired outcomes\n   - The lab infrastructure provides tools that could be misused\n   - The systematic nature of the lab's approach might make selective reporting less obvious\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, these multiple analyses would likely represent her \"fishing expedition\" to find significant results, rather than honest exploration of robustness. The scripts would exist either way, but their purpose and how they were used in reporting would differ.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "To evaluate whether Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to carefully weigh all the evidence, considering both incriminating and exculpatory factors:\n\nIncriminating evidence:\n1. The p-value distribution shows an unusual concentration just below .05 with few values just above it - a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking (strong evidence)\n2. Preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (very strong evidence)\n3. Earlier analysis script included participants who were later excluded from the final dataset (moderately concerning)\n4. Emails stating she \"needs this one to work\" and concerns about null results hurting her career show clear motivation (moderately concerning)\n\nExculpatory evidence:\n1. Clean prior record with well-documented, reproducible research that passed independent audit (moderately strong defense)\n2. Legitimate exclusion of two participants based on notes predating submission (mild defense)\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure explain some inconsistencies (mild defense)\n4. Multiple analysis scripts were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative (mild defense)\n\nParticularly damning is the combination of modified preregistration after data collection and the telltale p-value distribution just below .05. These are difficult to explain through innocent means. The preregistration modification directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration and indicates intentional changes to analysis plans after seeing the data.\n\nWhile technical issues like the software switch and hard drive failure are plausible, they also provide convenient cover for data inconsistencies. Her previously clean record suggests this may have been a response to unusual pressure rather than a pattern of misconduct.\n\nWeighing all factors, there are multiple serious red flags that strongly suggest deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
