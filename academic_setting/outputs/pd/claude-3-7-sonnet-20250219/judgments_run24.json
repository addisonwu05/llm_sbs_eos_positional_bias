  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, there are multiple compelling alternative explanations for the printer failure that do not involve Alex deliberately damaging it:\n\n1. The printer had a documented history of the same failure in other departments without evidence of mishandling\n2. The technician specifically identified a known defect with the fuser unit in this model\n3. Security footage shows Jamie handling the printer roughly earlier that day\n4. Alex proactively reported grinding noises three days before the breakdown\n5. Alex had an established pattern of properly reporting equipment issues\n\nWhile some evidence appears to implicate Alex (plastic fragments, proximity to the printer), these can be explained by Alex's regular use of a malfunctioning printer. The timing of Alex's departure before the critical error, combined with the documented mechanical issues and Jamie's rough handling, creates reasonable doubt about Alex's responsibility.\n\nThe printer appears to have failed due to a combination of its pre-existing mechanical defects and potentially Jamie's forceful handling of a paper jam, not because of deliberate damage by Alex."
