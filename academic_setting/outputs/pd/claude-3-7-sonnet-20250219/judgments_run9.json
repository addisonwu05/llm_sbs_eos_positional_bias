  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nWhile there are some suspicious elements like the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and their contradictory statements about printer use, the evidence pointing to Alex's innocence is stronger. The printer has a documented history of similar failures in other departments, Alex proactively reported issues with the printer days before the breakdown, and security footage shows Jamie forcefully pulling on jammed paper. Alex also has a consistent history of properly reporting equipment problems rather than damaging them. Together with the printer's known defects and the timing of events, these factors suggest the breakdown was more likely caused by the printer's mechanical issues, possibly exacerbated by Jamie's actions, rather than by Alex."
