  "Based on my analysis of the complete pattern of evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe modified preregistration document after data collection and the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05 are particularly strong indicators that cannot be easily explained through legitimate research practices. These represent serious breaches of research integrity that align with intentional manipulation rather than honest mistakes.\n\nWhen combined with her explicit statements about needing the study to work, the exclusion of participants from earlier analyses, and the pattern of other concerning practices, the evidence collectively points toward deliberate misconduct rather than a series of unfortunate coincidences or misunderstandings.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some proper documentation practices, they are outweighed by the more serious indicators of p-hacking and improper manipulation of research protocols.\n\nNo"
