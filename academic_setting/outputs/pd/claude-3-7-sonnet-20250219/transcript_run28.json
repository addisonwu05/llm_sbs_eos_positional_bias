The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, this still constitutes questionable research practices.\n\n4. **Software Issues**: The lab's software switch could potentially create anomalies, but it's extremely unlikely to create this specific pattern around .05.\n\n## Statistical Unlikelihood\nThe clustering of p-values just below .05 with a drop-off just above .05 is statistically very improbable under legitimate analysis. This pattern is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of selective reporting or data manipulation in research integrity investigations.\n\nWhile honest errors can explain many data irregularities, this specific p-value distribution is extraordinarily difficult to attribute to chance or innocent mistakes.

Modifying preregistration documents after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly undermines this purpose.\n\n## Valid Reasons for Post-Data Modifications?\n\nIn legitimate research practice, there are very few acceptable scenarios for modifying preregistration after data collection:\n\n1. **Documentation of Deviations**: Researchers might update a preregistration to note deviations from the original plan, but this should be clearly marked as a post-data amendment, not changing the original plan itself.\n\n2. **Correction of Genuine Errors**: If the preregistration contained obvious errors (e.g., typos, incorrect formula notation), corrections might be made, but changing actual methodological decisions is problematic.\n\n3. **Technical Platform Requirements**: Some preregistration platforms might require format updates, but this wouldn't involve changing substantive content like exclusion criteria or primary outcomes.\n\n## Why This Is Particularly Problematic\n\nChanging exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing data is especially concerning because:\n\n1. These are precisely the factors that most directly influence whether analyses yield significant results\n2. Modifying them after data collection allows researchers to select criteria that produce desired outcomes\n3. This undermines the entire purpose of preregistration as a safeguard against researcher degrees of freedom\n\n## Scientific Norms and Expectations\n\nIn standard scientific practice:\n- Preregistration documents are considered fixed after data collection begins\n- Changes require transparent documentation as deviations, not modifications to the original plan\n- Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is widely recognized as a serious breach of research methodology\n\nWhile honest administrative errors can occur in research, the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) aligns precisely with what would be modified to achieve significant results. The probability of this occurring innocently is extremely low.\n\nProbability that this would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 5"

It represents \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) - one of the most common forms of research misconduct\n2. It creates a false paper trail to make p-hacking appear to be legitimate, pre-planned analysis\n3. It helps evade detection by reviewers who specifically check whether reported analyses match preregistered plans\n\n## Motivation and Opportunity\n\nThe case details indicate strong motivational factors:\n- High-profile study\n- Pressure from Professor Mills for publishable findings\n- Grant review stakes\n- Initial positive reviews creating pressure to maintain the results\n\nThese circumstances create powerful incentives to ensure the data supports the hypothesis by whatever means necessary. Modifying preregistration documents provides a straightforward way to legitimize analyses that were actually conducted to achieve significance.\n\nGiven the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes), their timing (after data collection), and their direct utility in producing significant results, this behavior would be extremely consistent with deliberate academic misconduct.\n\nProbability that this would occur if Lena did commit academic misconduct: 92"

It's entirely normal for a supervisor to communicate the importance of certain studies for securing future funding.\n\n2. **Publication Bias**: Academia's \"publish or perish\" culture creates genuine career pressure to produce positive results.

Lena's concern about postdoc prospects is realistic.\n\n## Expression vs. Action\n\nExpressing frustration, anxiety, and awareness of systemic pressures is fundamentally different from acting unethically in response to those pressures. Many researchers:\n\n- Openly discuss these systemic problems with peers\n- Feel genuine stress about the career implications of their results\n- Hope for supportive findings while maintaining research integrity\n- Use such conversations as a way to vent about structural problems in academia\n\n## Context Matters\n\nThese statements could reflect:\n- Normal venting to a trusted friend\n- Acknowledgment of systemic pressures without intention to compromise ethics\n- Anxiety about factors outside her control\n- A desire for the theory being tested to be validated through legitimate means\n\nMany ethical researchers make similar statements while still maintaining research integrity. The statements show awareness of problematic incentives in academia but don't themselves prove misconduct.\n\nThese emails do reveal that Lena had motivation to produce positive results, which is a risk factor for misconduct.

This practice becoming more common as open science practices gain prominence.\n\n## Legitimate Robustness Testing Practices\n\nThe exploration of alternative analyses is consistent with several methodologically sound practices:\n\n1. **Multiverse Analysis**: This emerging method intentionally examines how results vary across different reasonable analytical decisions to assess robustness.\n\n2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Researchers test how different exclusion criteria affect results to understand the stability of findings across methodological choices.\n\n3. **Transparency in Analytical Flexibility**: Open science advocates encourage documenting multiple analysis paths rather than only reporting a single approach.\n\n4. **Research Team Training**: Labs often encourage students to explore multiple analytical approaches as part of methodological training.\n\n## Contextual Support for Legitimacy\n\nSeveral factors support the legitimacy of these practices in this case:\n\n1. **Lab-Wide Practice**: The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns\" suggests this is a methodological policy rather than individual behavior.\n\n2. **Documented Push for Robustness**: The description of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" indicates an explicit methodological initiative.\n\n3. **Transparent Logging**: These explorations were openly stored in the lab's data management system rather than hidden.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach**: The scripts follow a pattern (varying exclusion criteria) consistent with systematic robustness testing.\n\n## Best Practices Context\n\nWhile running multiple analyses can be used for p-hacking, the systematic and transparent nature described here aligns with evolving best practices. The proper implementation involves:\n\n- Pre-specification of the primary analysis\n- Documentation of all analytical alternatives\n- Transparency about which analyses were exploratory\n- Not selectively reporting only favorable outcomes\n\nThe pattern described – with systematic variations, lab-wide implementation, and transparent documentation – is highly consistent with legitimate robustness testing rather than concealed p-hacking.\n\nProbability that this would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 90"

    "content": "# Likelihood of Multiple Analysis Scripts Given Misconduct\n\nIf Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria could serve dual purposes - appearing legitimate while facilitating p-hacking.\n\n## Strategic Value in Misconduct Context\n\nFor someone engaging in misconduct, multiple analysis versions offer significant advantages:\n\n1. **Plausible Cover for P-hacking**: The existence of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" provides perfect cover for running numerous analyses until finding significant results.\n\n2. **Camouflage Within Legitimate Practice**: By matching the pattern of other students' work, questionable selective reporting becomes difficult to distinguish from legitimate sensitivity analysis.\n\n3. **Deniability Through Normalization**: When everyone runs multiple analyses, selectively choosing the favorable ones becomes easier to defend as standard practice.\n\n4. **Documentation Shield**: Having all versions stored creates an appearance of transparency while still allowing selective reporting of only favorable outcomes.\n\n## Implementation in Misconduct Cases\n\nThis pattern appears in documented cases where:\n\n1. Researchers run multiple analyses but only report those yielding desired outcomes\n2. Post-hoc decisions about exclusion criteria are made based on which versions produce significant results\n3. The existence of alternative analyses is used to defend the chosen approach as just one of many \"reasonable\" options\n\n## Context-Specific Factors\n\nSeveral elements make this particularly likely in Lena's case:\n\n1. **Lab Culture Exploitation**: The lab's existing practice provides perfect cover for exploring until finding significant results\n2. **Selective Reporting Opportunity**: Multiple legitimate versions make it easier to justify choosing the one with p < .05\n3. **Technical Sophistication**: Lena's previously demonstrated documentation skills would make this approach more feasible\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nThe existence of multiple analyses is actually highly consistent with both legitimate practice AND misconduct - it would be expected in either scenario. The key difference lies not in their existence but in how they were used (selectively vs. transparently).\n\nFor someone engaging in misconduct, leveraging an existing lab practice of creating multiple analysis scripts provides an ideal mechanism that is both effective and difficult to distinguish from legitimate research.\n\nProbability that this would occur if Lena did commit academic misconduct: 85"

The contemporaneous documentation of these issues in raw data files strongly suggests legitimate exclusion practices.\n\n## Standard Research Exclusion Practices\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience studies, particularly those involving memory:\n\n1. **Attention Requirements**: Tasks typically require focused attention to measure cognitive processes accurately. A participant falling asleep fundamentally invalidates their data.\n\n2. **Comprehension Necessity**: Participants who don't understand instructions aren't completing the intended task, rendering their data meaningless for the research question.\n\n3. **Standard Exclusion Criteria**: These specific issues (inattention and failure to understand instructions) are among the most common and accepted reasons for participant exclusion.\n\n## Significance of Contemporaneous Documentation\n\nThe notes in the raw data files that \"predate any journal submission\" are particularly important:\n\n1. **Real-time Documentation**: Notes made at or near the time of data collection reflect genuine observations rather than post-hoc justifications.\n\n2. **Protocol Adherence**: This approach follows best practices for documenting exclusions at the time they occur.\n\n3. **Transparency**: The existence of these notes in the raw files (rather than only in later analysis documents) creates an audit trail.\n\n## Procedural Integrity Indicators\n\nSeveral aspects of this situation indicate procedural integrity:\n\n1. **Appropriate Reasons**: The stated reasons are scientifically valid grounds for exclusion.\n\n2. **Proper Timing**: Documentation before analysis or submission indicates decisions made on methodological rather than outcome-based grounds.\n\n3. **Limited Scope**: Only two participants were excluded, suggesting focused application of criteria rather than wholesale filtering.\n\nThis pattern of documented, contemporaneous exclusions for legitimate methodological reasons is precisely what we would expect to see in well-conducted research. The timing of the notes before journal submission is particularly indicative of proper research practices.\n\nProbability that this would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 98"

These particular exclusions appear to represent standard research practice regardless of other potential misconduct.\n\n## Independent Legitimacy of These Exclusions\n\nThese exclusions stand apart from potential misconduct for several reasons:\n\n1. **Objectively Valid Grounds**: Falling asleep or failing to understand instructions are universally accepted reasons for exclusion in cognitive research, regardless of a researcher's ethical stance on other matters.\n\n2. **Contemporaneous Documentation**: The existence of notes predating journal submission indicates these particular exclusions were documented at the time they occurred, not retrospectively justified.\n\n3. **Limited Scope**: Only two participants with clear issues were excluded on these grounds, suggesting these were genuine cases rather than manufactured justifications.\n\n## Concurrent Legitimate and Questionable Practices\n\nResearch misconduct often exists alongside legitimate practices:\n\n1. **Selective Misconduct**: Researchers who engage in questionable practices often do so selectively rather than compromising every aspect of their methodology.\n\n2. **Basic Protocol Adherence**: Standard procedures (like excluding inattentive participants) typically continue even when other aspects of analysis may be compromised.\n\n3. **Documentation Habits**: Established documentation practices often persist even when other research practices become problematic.\n\n## Probability Assessment Rationale\n\nThese exclusions would likely exist whether or not misconduct occurred elsewhere in the study because:\n\n1. They represent basic quality control that occurs in virtually all cognitive studies\n2. The contemporaneous documentation suggests these were genuine observations\n3. These exclusions follow standard protocol independent of any p-hacking\n\nEven researchers engaging in misconduct typically maintain basic methodological standards for clearly invalid data.

The combination of statistical anomalies, altered preregistration, and selective participant exclusion strongly suggests deliberate manipulation to achieve significance.\n\nThe evidence suggests Lena likely engaged in p-hacking and selective reporting to produce significant results, constituting academic misconduct.\n\nProbability that Lena committed academic misconduct: 85"

The most compelling indicators include the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, and the selective exclusion of participants between analysis versions. These methodological manipulations align perfectly with her explicitly stated motivations about needing the study to \"work\" for her career prospects. While there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate exclusions, they are insufficient to explain the pattern of irregularities that specifically served to produce statistically significant results."
