  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer. The most compelling evidence points away from Alex's responsibility: the building access logs show Alex left 7 minutes before the critical error occurred, security footage shows another employee (Jamie) roughly handling the printer, and this particular printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments. While some circumstantial evidence raises questions about Alex, the technical timeline and established printer defects provide more convincing alternative explanations for the failure."
