  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe evidence points more strongly toward Alex's innocence: he badged out 7 minutes before the error occurred, had a history of properly reporting equipment issues (including warning about this printer days earlier), and there's security footage of another employee (Jamie) handling the printer roughly. Additionally, this printer model has a documented history of the exact same failure in other departments without misconduct. While there are some suspicious elements like the plastic fragments and Alex's presence near the printer, these can be reasonably explained by innocent interactions with an already-failing printer. The totality of evidence suggests the failure was likely due to the printer's known mechanical issues, possibly exacerbated by Jamie's handling, rather than deliberate action by Alex."
