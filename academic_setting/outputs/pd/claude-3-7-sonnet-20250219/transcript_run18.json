The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Let me explain why:\n\n## Common Forms of Data Misconduct\n\n1. **p-hacking with Intent**: Researchers who intentionally manipulate analyses to achieve significance typically target the conventional .05 threshold. They try various analytical approaches until finding ones that produce p-values just below .05.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: A researcher might run many analyses but only report those with p < .05, deliberately concealing non-significant results.\n\n3. **Data Manipulation**: More direct forms of misconduct involve altering data points or selectively excluding outliers specifically to push p-values below the significance threshold.\n\n4. **Post-hoc Hypothesis Adjustment**: Changing hypotheses after seeing results to match what was found significant.\n\n## Statistical Fingerprint\n\nThe pattern described - many p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above - is considered a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or data manipulation. This occurs because:\n\n- The researcher typically stops manipulating data once significance is achieved\n- There's no incentive to push p-values much lower than necessary\n- There's strong incentive to push borderline non-significant results (p > .05) to just below the threshold\n\nThis creates the distinctive \"cliff\" or \"drop\" in the p-curve right at .05, which statistical auditing methods specifically look for as evidence of potential misconduct.\n\n## Assessment\n\nIf Lena did engage in misconduct, this p-value pattern is exactly what we would expect to see. This doesn't prove misconduct occurred (correlation is not causation), but the pattern is highly consistent with and strongly indicative of problematic data handling practices.\n\nThe clustered sub-.05 p-values with the absence of values just above .05 is among the strongest statistical red flags for potential misconduct in quantitative research.\n\n90"

Let me examine the likelihood of this occurring without misconduct:\n\n## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion\n\n1. **Standard Data Cleaning**: Researchers routinely identify and exclude participants who:\n   - Failed attention checks or manipulation checks\n   - Showed extreme response patterns (e.g., straight-lining)\n   - Had excessive missing data\n   - Were statistical outliers based on pre-defined criteria\n\n2. **Protocol Violations**: Participants might be excluded if they:\n   - Did not follow task instructions properly\n   - Had technical issues during the experiment\n   - Were found to meet exclusion criteria that wasn't initially caught\n\n3. **Reviewer Feedback**: After journal review, reviewers might suggest:\n   - More stringent exclusion criteria\n   - Different handling of outliers\n   - Additional quality control measures\n\n4. **Methodological Refinement**: As analysis progresses, researchers often develop more sophisticated criteria for:\n   - Identifying poor-quality data\n   - Handling specific experimental artifacts\n   - Applying more appropriate exclusion thresholds\n\n## Normal Research Workflow\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience particularly, it's standard practice to:\n- Start with all collected data\n- Apply increasingly refined exclusion criteria\n- Document changes in analysis approach\n- Finalize the dataset based on methodologically sound criteria\n\nThe evolution from an earlier script with more participants to a final dataset with exclusions represents normal analytical progression and quality control in research.\n\n## Assessment\n\nWithout additional information suggesting problematic patterns in who was excluded, having participants in early analyses that don't appear in the final dataset is extremely common in legitimate research. Nearly all published studies go through some form of data cleaning and participant exclusion between initial and final analyses.\n\n75"

Let me analyze why:\n\n## Data Manipulation Through Selective Exclusion\n\n1. **Result-Driven Exclusion**: Researchers engaging in misconduct often:\n   - Selectively remove participants whose data weaken the desired effect\n   - Create post-hoc justifications for exclusions that primarily serve to improve statistical significance\n   - Apply inconsistent exclusion criteria that systematically favor the hypothesis\n\n2. **Outcome-Peeking**: This involves:\n   - Running analyses with all participants\n   - Identifying which participants' removal would strengthen results\n   - Developing seemingly objective criteria that happen to exclude those specific participants\n\n3. **Strategic Outlier Removal**: Researchers might:\n   - Apply outlier definitions that disproportionately remove data points weakening their hypothesis\n   - Use different outlier criteria across different analyses without justification\n   - Only scrutinize potential outliers in conditions where removal benefits the desired outcome\n\n## Pattern Consistency with Misconduct\n\nThe pattern of excluding certain participants between versions is completely consistent with data manipulation tactics. This is especially concerning when combined with the unusual clustering of p-values just below .05. Together, these suggest a potential process of:\n\n1. Running initial analyses with all participants\n2. Identifying which participants' removal would push p-values below significance thresholds\n3. Creating post-hoc justifications for excluding exactly those participants\n4. Finalizing analyses with the curated dataset that yields desired outcomes\n\n## Assessment\n\nParticipant exclusion is a powerful and relatively easy method for manipulating statistical outcomes. If misconduct did occur, it's highly likely it would involve strategic participant exclusion between analysis versions. The removal of participants between early and final analyses would be an expected component of p-hacking or data manipulation to achieve desired significance levels.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that participant exclusion alone doesn't prove misconduct, as legitimate exclusions are common. The key would be whether the pattern of who was excluded systematically favors the hypothesis without methodological justification.\n\n85"

Let me analyze why:\n\n## Legitimate Research Practices\n\n1. **Robustness Testing Best Practices**:\n   - Exploring how results hold under different analytical decisions is increasingly encouraged in scientific research\n   - Multiverse or specification curve analyses are recommended by methodologists\n   - Testing stricter and looser exclusion criteria helps establish the boundary conditions of effects\n\n2. **Lab-Wide Methodological Initiative**:\n   - A documented lab-wide push for robustness testing provides institutional context\n   - Similar patterns across multiple students suggests a systematic methodological approach\n   - This represents a structured methodological practice rather than an individual's anomalous behavior\n\n3. **Transparency in Documentation**:\n   - Storing multiple scripts in accessible logs demonstrates transparency\n   - This creates an auditable trail of analytical decisions\n   - Open documentation of alternative approaches is inconsistent with attempts to hide questionable practices\n\n## Methodological Context\n\nIn contemporary cognitive neuroscience, robustness testing is increasingly seen as essential for reliable science. Key practices include:\n- Systematically varying preprocessing pipelines\n- Testing results with different exclusion criteria \n- Reporting how findings change across analytical decisions\n\nThe lab's approach appears to align with these recommended practices for robust and transparent science.\n\n## Assessment\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be highly expected as part of legitimate robustness testing. The fact that this was part of a lab-wide initiative with similar patterns across students further strengthens the case that this represents methodological thoroughness rather than problematic practices.\n\nThis pattern shows exactly what we would expect to see in a lab embracing current best practices for robust and reproducible science.\n\n95"

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n## Dual Interpretation of Multiple Scripts\n\n1. **Cover for P-hacking Activities**:\n   - A lab-wide robustness initiative provides perfect cover for trying multiple analyses to find significant results\n   - Running various exclusion criteria allows identifying which specific criteria yield desired outcomes\n   - The legitimacy of the lab practice makes the exploration of multiple analytical pathways seem methodologically sound\n\n2. **Selective Reporting Opportunity**:\n   - Having multiple legitimate scripts enables selecting the most favorable results for publication\n   - The researcher could run numerous analyses but only highlight those supporting the hypothesis\n   - The appearance of thoroughness masks the selective use of results\n\n3. **Plausible Deniability**:\n   - If questioned, the existence of multiple scripts supports claims of methodological thoroughness\n   - Similar patterns across lab members makes individual questionable practices harder to detect\n   - The documented lab initiative provides institutional justification for analytical flexibility\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n\nFrom a misconduct perspective, a lab culture that encourages multiple analyses actually provides:\n- More \"researcher degrees of freedom\" to find significant results\n- Institutional cover for exploratory analyses\n- Legitimate explanation for why numerous analytical approaches were tried\n\n## Assessment\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying criteria would still be highly likely, as this pattern:\n1. Provides more opportunities to find desired results\n2. Makes it harder to distinguish legitimate exploration from p-hacking\n3. Creates documentary evidence of methodological thoroughness that could deflect suspicion\n\nThe key difference would be in how these multiple analyses were used and reported, not in their existence. In a misconduct scenario, Lena might have run these various analyses not to test robustness, but to identify which specific analytical pathway would yield the most favorable results for selective reporting.\n\nThe similarity to other students' practices makes this even more likely, as it normalizes the behavior and makes it less likely to draw scrutiny.\n\n85"

Let me analyze the likelihood of these events in the absence of misconduct:\n\n## Software Changes in Research Settings\n\n1. **Common Institutional Transitions**:\n   - Labs frequently update software or switch packages for various legitimate reasons:\n     - License cost considerations\n     - New features or capabilities becoming available\n     - Institutional policy changes\n     - Compatibility with new analysis methods\n   - Mid-project software transitions, while disruptive, are relatively common\n\n2. **Timing Considerations**:\n   - Software transitions are typically planned around institutional schedules rather than individual projects\n   - The timing of a lab-wide switch would be determined by factors beyond Lena's control\n   - Such transitions often occur at department or institution-wide levels\n\n## Hardware Failures\n\n1. **Prevalence of Hard Drive Failures**:\n   - Hard drive failures are extremely common technical issues\n   - Research laptops often face heavy computational demands, increasing failure risk\n   - The 2-3 year failure rate for hard drives ranges from 5-10% under normal conditions\n\n2. **Independent Verification**:\n   - IT department confirmation provides objective evidence of the hardware issue\n   - The documented repair record establishes a timeline consistent with the reported events\n   - This represents verification from a party without direct interest in the research outcomes\n\n## Combined Assessment\n\nThese events represent ordinary technical challenges in research environments:\n- Software transitions are routine institutional events\n- Hard drive failures are common hardware issues\n- The independent IT confirmation provides objective documentation\n\nNeither event is unusual, and their co-occurrence, while potentially disruptive to research workflow, represents a plausible and common scenario in academic settings.\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of these technical issues occurring as described is quite high. These represent ordinary challenges in research environments that would be documented in exactly this way. The independent IT confirmation particularly strengthens the credibility of the hardware failure claim.\n\n85"

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n## Software Transition Assessment\n\n1. **Institutional Nature of Software Changes**:\n   - Lab-wide software transitions are determined at the lab or departmental level\n   - Such changes would occur regardless of Lena's individual actions or intentions\n   - This represents an external event outside Lena's direct control\n\n2. **Potential Strategic Use**:\n   - A software transition creates natural discontinuities in analysis pipelines\n   - These transitions can provide legitimate-seeming explanations for changes in analytical approaches\n   - Inconsistencies between earlier and later analyses could be attributed to software differences\n\n## Hard Drive Failure Considerations\n\n1. **Verification Factor**:\n   - IT department confirmation provides objective evidence the hardware failure occurred\n   - The documented repair establishes the event's legitimacy regardless of Lena's research conduct\n   - This represents a verifiable technical issue with independent documentation\n\n2. **Strategic Implications**:\n   - Missing files could potentially benefit someone seeking to obscure analytical history\n   - A legitimate hardware failure provides a non-suspicious explanation for gaps in documentation\n   - The timing could be either coincidental or potentially convenient\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, both events would still be highly likely to occur exactly as documented because:\n\n1. The lab-wide software switch represents an institutional decision outside her control\n2. Hard drive failures are common technical problems with documented frequency\n3. The independent IT confirmation establishes the hardware failure as a verified event\n\nThese technical issues would occur at similar rates regardless of Lena's research conduct. If misconduct did occur, these events might have presented opportunities or challenges, but their occurrence would be largely independent of any misconduct.\n\nIn a misconduct scenario, these events might be leveraged opportunistically, but their existence and documentation would remain essentially the same as in a non-misconduct scenario.\n\n75"

These issues go beyond mere sloppiness and suggest deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nHowever, Lena's previously strong research practices, the lab context of exploring multiple analyses, and some legitimate exclusions with proper documentation present a more complex picture than straightforward fabrication.\n\nThe evidence suggests a pattern potentially consistent with a researcher who typically follows good practices but who, under significant career pressure, may have crossed ethical lines for this particular high-stakes study.\n\n75"
