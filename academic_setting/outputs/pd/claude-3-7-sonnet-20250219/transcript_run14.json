The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here's why:\n\n## Expected p-value distribution\nUnder null hypothesis conditions, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. When there are true effects, we expect more small p-values (e.g., below .01), but the distribution around the arbitrary .05 threshold should still be roughly continuous.\n\n## Why this pattern is suspicious\nThe clustering of p-values just below .05 with an abrupt drop-off above .05 creates what researchers call a \"p-value cliff\" or \"p-hacking signature.\" This pattern strongly suggests selective reporting or data manipulation designed to achieve statistical significance.\n\n## Alternative explanations\nCould this pattern occur without misconduct?\n\n1. **Random chance**: Extremely unlikely - the probability of multiple p-values naturally clustering just below .05 with none just above is mathematically improbable.\n\n2. **Undisclosed multiple analyses**: Lena might have run many analyses and only reported those that were significant (p < .05), which constitutes p-hacking but might reflect poor research practices rather than fabrication.\n\n3. **Analytical flexibility without documentation**: She might have tried different preprocessing steps, exclusion criteria, or analysis choices until finding \"significant\" results.\n\n4. **Software peculiarities**: While software issues might explain some data anomalies, they wouldn't specifically target the area around p = .05.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe described pattern is one of the strongest statistical red flags for data manipulation in scientific research. While technically possible by chance, such a distribution is vanishingly unlikely to occur naturally. Even accounting for the possibility of innocent explanations, the described pattern is highly inconsistent with unbiased data collection and analysis.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

Here's why:\n\n## Common forms of p-value manipulation\n\n1. **P-hacking**: Researchers who engage in p-hacking typically run analyses repeatedly with slight variations (removing outliers, trying different statistical tests, adding/removing covariates) until they find a p-value below .05. This practice specifically creates the pattern described.\n\n2. **Selective reporting**: A researcher may run multiple analyses but only report those that yield \"significant\" results, creating an artificial cliff at p = .05.\n\n3. **Data manipulation**: When researchers manipulate data to achieve significance, they typically aim to just clear the significance threshold rather than create extremely low p-values, which might attract skepticism.\n\n4. **HARKing** (Hypothesizing After Results are Known): This involves presenting exploratory findings as if they were predicted, and often combines with p-hacking to produce results just below .05.\n\n## Research on fraudulent patterns\n\nStatistical analyses of published literature have consistently found that this specific pattern - the \"p-value cliff\" around .05 - is a reliable indicator of questionable research practices. Multiple studies examining retractions and fraud cases have found this pattern to be a common signature.\n\n## Intent and pressure\n\nThe scenario mentions that:\n- The study is \"high-profile\"\n- Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings\"\n- The paper received \"enthusiastic initial reviews\"\n\nThese conditions create strong incentives for a researcher to ensure results cross the significance threshold, especially for exploratory analyses that might otherwise be unreportable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe described p-value pattern is not just consistent with academic misconduct but is one of the most well-documented statistical signatures of data manipulation. If misconduct occurred, this is precisely the kind of statistical artifact we would expect to find, especially in exploratory analyses where manipulation is easier to hide than in pre-registered primary outcomes.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

Modifying primary outcomes allows researchers to highlight findings that worked while downplaying those that didn't.\n\n## Standard practice in ethical research\n\nThe ethical approach when deviating from preregistration is:\n- Keep the original preregistration intact\n- Document all changes transparently in the manuscript\n- Label any post-hoc analyses as exploratory\n- Explain why deviations were necessary\n\n## Contextual factors\n\nGiven that other evidence suggests p-hacking (clustering of p-values just below .05), the modification of the preregistration is particularly concerning. The two issues together strongly suggest intentional manipulation to achieve publishable results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile there are occasional legitimate reasons to document changes to a research plan, directly modifying the preregistration document to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is fundamentally contrary to scientific integrity and the principles of preregistration. The probability that this would occur without constituting misconduct is very low.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

This modification provides a paper trail that appears to legitimize otherwise questionable analytical decisions.\n\n## Specific to this case\n\nThe scenario describes:\n- Pressure to produce publishable findings\n- P-values suspiciously clustered just below significance\n- A whistleblower specifically mentioning \"analyses were changed after reviewers' comments\"\n\nThese factors suggest a pattern where Lena may have:\n1.

Many honest researchers feel these pressures acutely without committing misconduct. The statements reflect awareness of how science rewards positive findings, which is unfortunately a systemic issue.\n\n## Alternative interpretations\n\nWithout misconduct, these emails might indicate:\n- Venting frustration to a trusted friend\n- Seeking emotional support during a stressful research process\n- Acknowledging the reality of academic incentive structures\n- Expressing hope for a successful outcome\n\n## Consistency with honest research\n\nMany ethical researchers have similar thoughts about career pressures but respond by:\n- Being more thorough in their methods\n- Planning stronger studies\n- Preparing to frame null results in interesting ways\n- Looking for meaningful patterns beyond the primary hypothesis\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile these statements reveal concerning pressure and outcome-focused motivation, they are relatively common sentiments in academia that don't necessarily lead to misconduct.

If these exclusions follow predetermined criteria, they represent good scientific practice.\n\n2. **Technical issues discovered during analysis**: Problems like equipment malfunction, participant misunderstanding of instructions, or corrupted data files might only become apparent during initial data processing.\n\n3. **Reviewer suggestions**: After peer review, researchers might legitimately apply more stringent exclusion criteria based on reviewer feedback, though this should be transparent.\n\n4. **Protocol violations**: Participants who didn't follow instructions or meet inclusion criteria might be excluded after closer examination of their data.\n\n5. **Iterative quality control**: Researchers might refine data cleaning procedures as they better understand the characteristics of their dataset.\n\n## Concerning factors in this specific case\n\nHowever, several contextual elements make this exclusion more suspicious:\n\n1.

If anything, a researcher planning misconduct might opportunistically use such legitimate complications to their advantage, but wouldn't necessarily cause them to happen.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

The transparent documentation in lab logs and consistency with other students' practices strongly suggests this was a legitimate methodological approach rather than an attempt to manipulate findings. This pattern actually aligns with increasing emphasis on analytical transparency and robustness testing in scientific research.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" might provide perfect cover for what methodologists call \"researcher degrees of freedom\" - the flexibility to make multiple analytical decisions until finding favorable outcomes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, having multiple analysis scripts would be highly likely and would actually facilitate the misconduct rather than contradict it. The multiple scripts would represent the mechanism through which p-hacking and selective reporting occurred, while the lab-wide nature of this practice would provide excellent cover for these questionable research practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

The contemporaneous documentation before journal submission is exactly what we would expect to see in properly conducted research. These exclusions are fundamentally different from post-hoc selective exclusions to achieve desired results, as they address basic data validity concerns documented in real-time.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "# Participant Exclusions in the Context of Misconduct\n\nIf Lena did commit academic misconduct, the documented exclusion of two participants for legitimate reasons (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with contemporaneous notes would still be highly likely. These particular exclusions would likely represent genuine quality control amidst other potentially problematic practices.\n\n## Coexistence of legitimate and illegitimate exclusions\n\nResearch misconduct rarely involves fabricating all aspects of a study. More commonly:\n\n1. **Selective documentation**: Researchers might properly document legitimate exclusions while obscuring questionable ones\n\n2. **Mixed practices**: Studies often contain both appropriate methodological decisions and inappropriate manipulations\n\n3. **Camouflage strategy**: Thoroughly documenting clear-cut exclusions helps disguise other, more questionable analytical choices\n\n4. **Partial integrity**: Even researchers engaging in misconduct typically follow proper protocols for obvious cases\n\n## Strategic benefits of documenting clear exclusions\n\nIf misconduct occurred, properly documenting these specific exclusions would serve several purposes:\n\n- Demonstrates apparent methodological rigor to reviewers\n- Creates perception of transparent documentation practices\n- Establishes precedent for participant exclusion in the study\n- Directs attention toward obvious exclusions and away from questionable ones\n\n## Standard practice regardless of other misconduct\n\nThe exclusion of participants who fall asleep or misunderstand tasks is such a basic methodological requirement that it would likely be followed even by researchers engaging in other forms of misconduct. These exclusions:\n\n- Represent obvious validity threats that no researcher would defend\n- Would be noticed and flagged by collaborators or assistants\n- Have clear documentation standards in most labs\n- Would raise suspicions if not properly handled\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, these particular documented exclusions would likely still be legitimate and properly handled. Misconduct typically involves more subtle manipulations rather than ignoring obvious data quality issues like participants falling asleep. The contemporaneous documentation of these clear-cut exclusions would be expected regardless of other potential misconduct, and might even serve to establish an appearance of methodological rigor that could help disguise more questionable practices elsewhere in the analysis.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"
