  "No\n\nBased on the totality of evidence presented, while there are certainly some suspicious elements regarding Alex, there are also significant alternative explanations and exonerating factors. The documented history of this printer model failing in similar ways in other departments, Jamie's captured rough handling of the printer on security footage, Alex's proactive email about concerning noises days earlier, and his consistent history of properly reporting equipment issues all create reasonable doubt about Alex's culpability. While not definitively proven either way, I believe the evidence leans toward Alex not breaking the printer."
