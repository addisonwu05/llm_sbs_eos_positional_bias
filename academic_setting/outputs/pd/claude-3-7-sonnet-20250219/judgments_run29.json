  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer. \n\nThe evidence against Alex breaking the printer is stronger than the evidence suggesting culpability. Most significantly, Alex physically left the building (per badge records) seven minutes before the printer's critical error occurred, making direct causation impossible. Additionally, security footage shows another coworker (Jamie) handling the printer roughly just before failure, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling, and Alex has an established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment issues - including warning about this specific printer three days earlier. While some circumstantial evidence exists against Alex (like similar plastic fragments in their trash and their expressed frustration), the timeline, alternative causes, and Alex's history of responsible behavior make it more likely that the printer failed due to a combination of its known mechanical vulnerabilities and Jamie's documented rough handling rather than any action by Alex."
