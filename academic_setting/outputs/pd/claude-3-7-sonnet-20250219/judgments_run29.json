  "Based on my analysis of the evidence presented, I believe the answer is:\n\nYes\n\nThe most compelling evidence pointing to academic misconduct includes:\n\n1. The preregistration document being modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, which fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration\n2. The statistically suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05 with very few just above this threshold, a pattern strongly associated with p-hacking\n3. The documented motivation in Lena's emails expressing pressure to produce significant results\n4. The modification of analyses after reviewer comments, suggesting post-hoc adjustments\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate exclusions, the core evidence shows a pattern of manipulating analyses and documentation to achieve desired significant results rather than following proper scientific procedures."
