The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The whole purpose of preregistration is to commit to analysis plans before seeing the data.\n\nFor a non-fraudulent researcher:\n\n1. Legitimate modifications to preregistration typically involve:\n   - Correction of errors in the original document\n   - Documentation of deviations from the original plan (as amendments, not by altering the original)\n   - Transparency about changes made and their justification\n\n2. The proper protocol for changes would be:\n   - Leave the original preregistration intact\n   - Submit an amendment or a new version with clear documentation of changes\n   - Explicitly acknowledge in the paper that changes were made after data collection\n\nChanging exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection without transparent documentation is particularly problematic because:\n- These specific changes can dramatically affect results\n- They represent the most concerning form of researcher degrees of freedom\n- They directly undermine the purpose of preregistration\n\nEven if Lena had legitimate reasons to update these aspects of the study, the correct approach would be to document the changes transparently, not modify the original document. The fact that the timestamps show the original document was modified (rather than amended) is very concerning.\n\nWhile honest mistakes can occur in research, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change these specific parameters (rather than documenting deviations) would be highly unusual and contrary to basic research integrity practices for anyone properly trained in research methods.\n\nTaking all factors into consideration, the probability that a non-fraudulent researcher would modify the preregistration document in this way is very low.\n\n25"

Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a common form of p-hacking - it allows researchers to selectively remove participants whose data doesn't support the desired conclusion.\n\n2. Modifying primary outcomes after data collection enables researchers to focus on whatever measure happened to show significance while pretending this was the intended focus all along.\n\n3. The timestamps proving modification after data collection suggest an attempt to cover up these changes, rather than transparently documenting them as deviations.\n\n4. The context indicates pressure for positive results from Professor Mills, who needs publishable findings before a grant review.\n\n5. The whistleblower specifically noted that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers' comments,\" suggesting a pattern of post-hoc manipulation.\n\n6. The reported results are suspiciously \"clean\" with strong statistical significance across multiple analyses, which aligns with what might occur if analyses were retrofitted to the data.\n\n7. Rather than creating a supplemental document acknowledging changes, the original preregistration was modified - indicating an intent to hide the fact that changes were made.\n\nThis type of modification directly undermines the entire purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researchers from cherry-picking analyses after seeing results. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, altering the preregistration document would be a logical step to make her selective analyses appear to have been planned from the beginning.\n\nIf academic misconduct occurred, the probability that the preregistration would be modified in this manner is very high.\n\n90"

In the absence of true effects, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1\n   - This means we should see roughly equal numbers of p-values in any equal-sized range (e.g., .040-.045, .045-.050, .050-.055)\n\n2. When true effects exist, the distribution tends to be right-skewed with:\n   - More very small p-values (e.g., p < .01)\n   - A relatively smooth distribution throughout the range\n\n3. What we would NOT expect to see naturally:\n   - A sharp discontinuity exactly at p = .05\n   - Many values just below .05 with almost none just above\n\nThe described pattern (many p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above) is a well-documented indicator of p-hacking. This unusual distribution suggests data or analyses may have been manipulated until results reached significance.\n\nMultiple studies examining published literature have found this exact pattern to be associated with questionable research practices, including:\n- Selectively reporting analyses that work\n- Optional stopping (collecting more data until significance is reached)\n- Trying multiple analysis variants until finding one that yields p < .05\n\nFor exploratory analyses specifically, finding multiple results that all cluster just below significance is even more suspicious, as exploratory work typically produces varied results across a range of p-values.\n\nWhile coincidences can happen in research, this specific pattern across multiple analyses is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n10"

Here's why:\n\n1. Researchers engaging in misconduct typically aim to reach the conventional significance threshold of p < .05, as this is often treated as a binary cutoff for \"publishable\" results.\n\n2. Common fraudulent techniques that produce exactly this pattern include:\n   - Running analyses repeatedly with slight variations until finding one that yields p < .05\n   - Selective exclusion of participants or data points until results cross the significance threshold\n   - Optional stopping (collecting additional data until reaching significance)\n   - Trying multiple statistical tests and only reporting those that \"work\"\n\n3. This pattern is particularly telling in exploratory analyses, where a researcher manipulating results would have maximum flexibility to try different approaches.\n\n4. Studies of p-value distributions in published literature have identified this \"cliff\" at p = .05 as a strong indicator of widespread p-hacking across fields.\n\n5. In the context of the other evidence (modified preregistration, whistleblower concerns about \"too perfect\" data), this unusual p-value distribution fits a coherent pattern of deliberate data manipulation.\n\nWhat makes this so incriminating is that natural processes and honest analyses would not produce such a sharp discontinuity exactly at the conventional significance threshold. The absence of p-values just above .05 suggests that analyses yielding such values were either modified or discarded.\n\nIf Lena was engaged in academic misconduct, the probability that her exploratory analyses would show this telltale p-value pattern is extremely high.\n\n95"

Legitimate quality control processes:\n   - Identifying contaminated data (e.g., participants who misunderstood tasks)\n   - Equipment malfunctions discovered during deeper analysis\n   - Participants who didn't complete all necessary components\n\n3. Standard data cleaning workflows:\n   - Many researchers run preliminary analyses on all data before applying exclusion criteria\n   - It's normal to have scripts that progress from raw to cleaned data\n\n4.

The progression toward misconduct is frequently gradual:\n   - Researchers often maintain integrity early in their careers before later violations\n   - Third-year PhD students face increasing pressures compared to earlier years\n   - The timing aligns with when career and publication pressures intensify\n\n3. The independent audit creates a meaningful barrier:\n   - Knowing previous work would be scrutinized would deter misconduct in those projects\n   - Audited studies likely received more careful attention to documentation\n   - External validation would create confidence that those specific projects were sound\n\n4. Different studies have different incentive structures:\n   - The current study was described as \"high-profile\" with grant implications\n   - Previous studies may not have carried the same career consequences\n   - The supervisor's pressure regarding the grant was likely specific to this project\n\n5. Research suggests misconduct is often project-specific:\n   - Studies of academic fraud show many researchers have a mix of legitimate and problematic work\n   - First violations typically occur after establishing credibility with honest research\n   - Having a record of integrity can provide cover for later misconduct\n\nA previously clean record with well-documented work is entirely compatible with subsequent misconduct, especially when new pressures emerge. In fact, this pattern of \"first offense after established credibility\" is quite common in academic misconduct cases.\n\n50"

    "content": "To evaluate this situation, I need to consider how likely this pattern of multiple analysis scripts would be in the absence of misconduct.\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria can be entirely legitimate in modern research practices:\n\n1. Robustness checking is a methodological best practice:\n   - Researchers are increasingly encouraged to test whether their results hold under different analytical decisions\n   - Exploring how different exclusion criteria affect results helps establish reliability\n   - This approach is recommended by statisticians and methodologists to address the \"garden of forking paths\" problem\n\n2. The lab-wide push for robustness exploration provides important context:\n   - This appears to be a systematic approach implemented across the lab\n   - The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests a standardized lab protocol\n   - It indicates this practice was encouraged by lab leadership, not an individual decision\n\n3. Transparency in storing multiple versions aligns with good research practice:\n   - Keeping records of alternative analyses shows methodological thoroughness\n   - Documenting different analytical approaches is increasingly expected in many fields\n   - The fact these scripts were logged in official lab records indicates transparency, not concealment\n\n4. Modern approaches to statistical analysis often include:\n   - Multiverse analysis (running many plausible analytical paths)\n   - Specification curve analysis (visualizing how different decisions affect outcomes)\n   - Sensitivity analysis (testing how robust findings are to different assumptions)\n\nThe key factor here is that these alternative analyses were openly documented in lab management logs rather than hidden, and they follow a lab-wide pattern rather than being unique to Lena's work. This transparency and consistency across researchers strongly suggests a legitimate methodological approach rather than deceptive practices.\n\nThis pattern is highly consistent with modern open science practices and would be expected in a lab that values methodological rigor.\n\n90"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely the observed pattern of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be if Lena did commit misconduct.\n\nEven if Lena committed misconduct, there are several reasons why her data management logs might still show multiple analysis scripts similar to other students:\n\n1. The lab-wide context is crucial:\n   - If running multiple analyses was standard lab practice, Lena would need to follow this protocol regardless of her intentions\n   - Deviating from lab norms by not exploring robustness would draw attention\n   - The lab culture appears to encourage methodological exploration\n\n2. Multiple analyses provide cover for selective reporting:\n   - Having legitimate reasons to run various analyses creates plausible deniability\n   - A researcher intending to p-hack could hide this behavior within an approved framework of \"robustness checking\"\n   - The misconduct wouldn't be in running multiple analyses, but in selectively reporting only favorable outcomes\n\n3. The transparency of logged scripts may be strategic:\n   - Maintaining visible compliance with lab protocols helps avoid suspicion\n   - Open documentation of some analytical flexibility can mask more problematic practices\n   - The logged scripts might not include all analyses actually performed\n\n4. Similar patterns across students doesn't preclude individual misconduct:\n   - Other students may be conducting legitimate robustness checks\n   - The superficial similarity in having multiple scripts doesn't guarantee identical intentions\n   - The specific content and sequence of Lena's scripts might reveal patterns not present in others' work\n\nThis situation illustrates how modern research practices that encourage analytical exploration can inadvertently provide cover for p-hacking. The difference between legitimate robustness checking and misconduct often lies not in whether multiple analyses were run, but in how they were selected for reporting and whether this selection was transparent.\n\nGiven the lab culture and the need to maintain appearances, this pattern would be quite likely even if misconduct occurred.\n\n80"

The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - a serious breach of research ethics.\n2. There's an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above - a statistical pattern strongly associated with p-hacking.\n3. Earlier analysis scripts show participants who were later excluded in the final dataset, suggesting possible selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n4. Emails expressing pressure to get positive results indicate motive (\"need this one to work,\" supervisor \"counting on this study\").\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n1. Two participants were properly excluded based on contemporaneous notes (falling asleep/not understanding instructions), showing appropriate data handling.\n2. The lab had a culture of running multiple analyses for robustness checking, with Lena's pattern matching other students.\n3. Technical issues (software switch, hard drive failure) provide plausible explanations for some file inconsistencies.\n4. Lena's previous work passed an independent audit and was rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The modified preregistration is particularly concerning as it's difficult to explain innocently.\n- The p-value distribution just below .05 is a well-established statistical fingerprint of p-hacking.\n- While some participant exclusions appear legitimate, others may have been selective.\n- The technical issues and lab practices provide context but don't fully explain the statistical anomalies.\n- Previous good conduct suggests this may be situational misconduct rather than a pattern.\n\nConsidering all evidence holistically, there are multiple serious red flags that are difficult to explain through innocent means, particularly the modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution. While some factors provide mitigating context, they don't sufficiently counter the strongest evidence of misconduct.\n\n75"
