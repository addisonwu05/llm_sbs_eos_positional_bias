The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Pre-established exclusion criteria: Participants might be excluded based on criteria that were determined before the study (e.g., performance below a certain threshold, excessive movement during neuroimaging, failure to complete all tasks).\n\n2. Quality control: After initial data collection, researchers might discover issues with certain participants' data (e.g., equipment malfunction, participant misunderstanding instructions).\n\n3. Outlier detection: Statistical outliers might be identified and excluded based on objective criteria.\n\n4. Reviewer feedback: Journal reviewers might suggest additional exclusion criteria or methodological improvements requiring participant exclusion.\n\n5. Power analysis refinements: After initial analysis, researchers might determine they don't need all participants for adequate statistical power.\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience specifically, participant exclusion is common practice. Data quality issues, participant compliance problems, or technical issues during recording can all necessitate legitimate exclusions.\n\nWhat would make this suspicious is if:\n- The exclusions happened selectively to achieve significance\n- The criteria weren't documented or were post-hoc\n- The exclusions weren't reported transparently\n\nHowever, if Lena is innocent, she would likely have documented valid reasons for these exclusions and applied them consistently. The fact that an earlier script exists with more participants is actually quite normal in research workflows - researchers often run preliminary analyses on full datasets before applying exclusion criteria.\n\nConsidering standard research practices, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it's highly likely that an earlier analysis script would include participants who were later legitimately excluded.\n\n75"

Here's why:\n\n1. P-hacking through selective exclusion: One common form of misconduct involves selectively removing participants whose data doesn't support the desired hypothesis. Researchers might try multiple exclusion criteria until they find one that yields significant results.\n\n2. Results-driven exclusions: Rather than applying pre-registered or methodologically justified exclusion criteria, a researcher committing misconduct might exclude participants specifically to strengthen statistical significance.\n\n3. Post-hoc criteria creation: After seeing the full dataset, unethical researchers might create exclusion criteria specifically designed to remove the \"problematic\" data points.\n\n4. Lack of transparency: In cases of misconduct, these exclusions often aren't properly documented or justified in the methods section.\n\n5. Data fishing: The earlier script could represent an initial honest analysis, while the final dataset represents the culmination of manipulative data exploration to find significance.\n\nThis pattern of having more participants initially and then excluding some to achieve the desired statistical outcome is actually a classic red flag in research misconduct investigations. It's exactly what we'd expect to see if a researcher was manipulating data to achieve publishable results, especially given the high-profile nature of this study and the pressure from Professor Mills to produce positive findings before the grant review.\n\nThe fact that the whistleblower specifically noted the data \"looked too perfect\" is particularly concerning, as it suggests the final dataset might have been curated to produce cleaner, more significant results than the original data warranted.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, the probability of seeing this pattern of participant exclusion between the earlier and final analysis is very high.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, these technical circumstances (software switch and hard drive failure) are quite plausible explanations for some data irregularities:\n\n1. Software transitions in labs: Research labs frequently update or change statistical software for various legitimate reasons - institutional license changes, new analytical capabilities, compatibility with collaborators, or improved features. Mid-project software transitions, while not ideal, are common in academic settings.\n\n2. Documented hardware failure: The independent confirmation from the IT department that Lena's laptop had a reported and repaired hardware failure provides objective verification of this event. This isn't just Lena's claim but a documented technical issue.\n\n3. Data loss reality: Hard drive failures are genuine technical problems that affect researchers regularly. Even with backup systems, some files can be lost during the period immediately preceding a failure.\n\n4. Timing coincidence: While the timing might seem suspicious, technical problems often cluster during high-workload periods when equipment is being heavily used.\n\n5. Normal research obstacles: These kinds of technical challenges represent the ordinary obstacles researchers regularly navigate, rather than suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe combination of these events might create inconsistencies in data organization or analysis that could appear suspicious to outside observers unfamiliar with the specific circumstances. However, these are precisely the kinds of mundane technical explanations that honestly explain data irregularities in many research projects.\n\nFor a researcher who did not commit misconduct, experiencing both a lab-wide software transition and a personal computer failure is unfortunate but not particularly unusual in academic research settings. These events represent common challenges in the research process rather than red flags for misconduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the software transition and hard drive failure could still be entirely genuine events that she opportunistically exploited or that coincidentally provided cover for her misconduct:\n\n1. Exploitation of legitimate circumstances: A researcher engaging in misconduct might seize upon actual technical transitions as opportunities to introduce manipulations while attributing inconsistencies to the software change.\n\n2. Convenient timing: While the hard drive failure itself may be genuine (confirmed by IT), a researcher committing fraud might strategically use this documented event to explain why certain problematic files or analyses are \"missing.\"\n\n3. Selective data loss: In the context of misconduct, convenient \"gaps\" in documentation could be attributed to the confirmed hard drive failure, while in reality those specific files might have been deliberately not restored or backed up.\n\n4. Technical complexity as cover: Software transitions create genuine complexity in data analysis pipelines that can make it harder for others to detect manipulations, as inconsistencies can be attributed to conversion issues or learning curves.\n\n5. Plausible deniability: These technical issues provide ready-made explanations that would be difficult to disprove - \"that discrepancy occurred during the software transition\" or \"those validation files were lost in the crash.\"\n\nThe fact that these events have independent verification (the lab-wide software change and IT-confirmed hardware failure) means they likely did occur. However, if Lena committed misconduct, these genuine technical issues could provide perfect cover for intentional manipulations.\n\nMany cases of sophisticated research misconduct involve opportunistically using real events and circumstances to mask intentional fraud. Rather than fabricating excuses entirely, researchers can leverage actual occurrences as explanatory shields for questionable practices.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, it's quite likely these technical issues genuinely occurred, with the misconduct being interwoven with or concealed by these legitimate circumstances.\n\n80"

    "content": "I need to carefully evaluate all the evidence to assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a severe violation of scientific practice.\n\n2. The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above, which is a statistical signature of p-hacking.\n\n3. Emails reveal Lena felt intense pressure for positive results, writing her supervisor was \"counting on this study\" and that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc.\"\n\n4. An earlier analysis script included additional participants who were later excluded from the final dataset.\n\n5. A whistleblower claimed data \"looked too perfect\" and that analyses were changed after reviewer comments.\n\n**Evidence suggesting innocence:**\n\n1. Lena has no prior history of data irregularities, with previous work passing an independent audit as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. Two participant exclusions were properly documented in real-time with legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions).\n\n3. The lab switched statistical software mid-project and Lena experienced a confirmed hard drive failure, potentially explaining some irregularities.\n\n4. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria were common in the lab as part of a \"robustness\" initiative.\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modification of preregistration after data collection and the suspicious p-value distribution. These are difficult to explain innocently. While the technical difficulties and clean prior record provide some mitigating context, they don't adequately explain these specific issues.\n\nThe pressure revealed in Lena's emails provides clear motive, and the pattern of evidence aligns with selective reporting and p-hacking to achieve significance.\n\nAfter considering all evidence, I conclude there is a high probability Lena committed some form of academic misconduct, likely p-hacking rather than complete fabrication.\n\n80"
