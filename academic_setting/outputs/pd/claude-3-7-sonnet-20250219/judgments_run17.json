  "Based on careful evaluation of all the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n\n1. The highly suspicious p-value distribution with many values just below .05 and almost none just above - a recognized statistical fingerprint of p-hacking\n\n2. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - a fundamental violation of research integrity\n\n3. The selective participant exclusion pattern between analysis versions\n\n4. Her explicit statements about needing the study to \"work\" for her career, establishing clear motivation\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors (clean prior record, documented technical issues, some legitimate exclusions), the statistical anomalies and preregistration modification in particular are difficult to explain through innocent means. These patterns align strongly with established markers of p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\nThe totality of evidence points to deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results rather than honest reporting of findings.\n\nNo"
