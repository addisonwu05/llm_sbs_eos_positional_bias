  "Based on the evidence presented, I cannot definitively state whether Alex broke the printer. There are suspicious elements regarding Alex (being near the printer, plastic fragments in trash, changed story, expression of frustration) but also significant exculpatory evidence (departure timing, documented history of similar failures in this model, Jamie's rough handling, Alex's history of proper reporting).\n\nThe case presents reasonable doubt, with the printer's documented failure history and Alex's absence when the error occurred being particularly significant. While some of Alex's behaviors raise questions, alternative explanations exist for each piece of evidence.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence and multiple plausible explanations for the failure, I cannot make a definitive determination of \"Yes\" or \"No\" with the information provided."
