  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nBased on my analysis of the evidence, the most compelling factors against Alex being responsible include:\n- The timeline showing Alex badged out 7 minutes before the critical error occurred\n- The printer model's documented history of similar failures without mishandling\n- Security footage showing Jamie roughly handling the printer, being the last clearly visible user\n- Alex's proactive reporting of the printer issues days earlier\n- Alex's established history of properly reporting equipment problems\n\nWhile some evidence initially appeared suspicious (fragments in trash, inconsistent statements), the physical impossibility of Alex causing the failure when not in the building, combined with the alternative explanations (Jamie's handling and the known defect), make it more likely this was a case of mechanical failure rather than damage caused by Alex."
