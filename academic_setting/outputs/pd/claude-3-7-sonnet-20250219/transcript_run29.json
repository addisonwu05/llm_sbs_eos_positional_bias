The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Exclusion criteria are often applied post-hoc when participants are found to have not followed instructions properly, shown excessive movement during neuroimaging, or performed at chance levels on key tasks.\n\n2. Outlier removal is a standard practice when participants show response patterns that deviate significantly from the norm.\n\n3. Technical issues during data collection (equipment failure, participant distraction, etc.) may only become apparent during initial analysis.\n\n4. Reviewers might have suggested more stringent inclusion criteria during the review process, which is a common occurrence in peer review.\n\n5. As the lab switched software, compatibility issues might have necessitated excluding certain data formats or participants with incomplete datasets.\n\nGiven these considerations, it would be entirely normal for a legitimate analysis to exclude some participants from an initial larger sample. In fact, most cognitive neuroscience studies go through this refinement process. The key would be whether these exclusions were:\n- Based on pre-specified criteria\n- Applied consistently\n- Properly documented\n- Not selectively applied just to achieve significance\n\nThe presence of excluded participants by itself is extremely common in honest research and provides very little evidence of misconduct. The more important questions would relate to the justification for those exclusions and whether they were selectively applied.\n\n75"

This practice is known as \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where researchers analyze data multiple ways and only report the analysis that yields the desired outcome.\n\nHere's why this would be likely if misconduct occurred:\n\n1. P-hacking often involves selectively removing \"inconvenient\" data points that don't support the hypothesis. Researchers might run analyses with and without certain participants to see which version produces significant results.\n\n2. The allegation that the data \"look too perfect\" is consistent with selective participant exclusion to create cleaner, more significant results.\n\n3. A researcher engaging in misconduct would likely try different exclusion criteria until finding one that produces the desired p-value (in this case, p = .01).\n\n4. The fact that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers' comments\" suggests potential post-hoc manipulation to satisfy reviewer expectations rather than following pre-registered or scientifically justified methods.\n\n5. Having both primary and secondary analyses with \"clean\" results is statistically unusual without some form of selection or manipulation, as real data typically contains more noise.\n\n6. The high-pressure situation (with Professor Mills needing publishable results for a grant review) creates motivation for such behavior.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, selectively excluding participants between analyses would be one of the most likely methods she would have employed, as it's relatively easy to do and difficult to detect without access to all versions of the data and analysis scripts.\n\n90"

Let me break down why this is unlikely in the absence of misconduct:\n\n1. In genuine research, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) or be skewed toward very small values (if there's a true effect). A \"bunching\" of values just below the significance threshold of .05 is not expected naturally.\n\n2. The probability of multiple independent exploratory analyses yielding results that cluster just below .05 is mathematically improbable. If these are truly exploratory analyses of real data, we would expect a more random distribution of p-values.\n\n3. The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly telling. In honest research, there should be approximately as many p-values just above the threshold as just below it - the arbitrary cutoff of .05 has no meaning to the natural phenomena being studied.\n\n4. This pattern (many p-values just below .05, few just above) has been extensively documented in meta-scientific research as a statistical fingerprint of p-hacking - where researchers analyze data multiple ways until finding significant results.\n\nEven without misconduct, researcher degrees of freedom in analysis can sometimes produce this pattern unconsciously. However, for it to occur across multiple exploratory analyses with such a stark absence of p-values above .05 would be extremely unlikely without some form of selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\nWhile there are hypothetical innocent explanations (extraordinary coincidence, unique characteristics of the specific phenomena being studied), their probability is very low compared to the explanation of selective reporting or analysis manipulation.\n\n15"

This type of exclusion represents good scientific practice - removing clearly invalid data based on objective criteria that were documented at the time of collection, rather than after analysis.\n\nIf Lena were conducting research with integrity, this is precisely how we would expect participant exclusions to be handled: based on legitimate methodological concerns, documented at the time of observation, and reflected in the original data files rather than added post-hoc during analysis.\n\n95"

    "content": "Even if Lena did commit academic misconduct, this particular exclusion of two participants appears to be legitimately documented and methodologically sound:\n\n1. The exclusion of participants who fall asleep or fail to understand instructions represents standard methodological practice that any researcher, ethical or not, would follow. These are objectively valid reasons for exclusion in cognitive studies.\n\n2. The contemporaneous documentation in raw data files that predates journal submission suggests these specific exclusions were made properly at the time of data collection, not retroactively to achieve desired results.\n\n3. If Lena were engaging in misconduct, it would likely occur through different mechanisms than these clearly documented legitimate exclusions. Misconduct typically involves undocumented or post-hoc exclusions, not ones properly noted in original data files.\n\n4. A researcher committing fraud would still follow standard protocols for obvious participant issues. The presence of legitimate exclusions doesn't preclude other forms of data manipulation occurring elsewhere.\n\n5. Even in cases of research misconduct, the majority of research procedures are typically carried out correctly. Misconduct often occurs in specific aspects of analysis or reporting rather than throughout the entire research process.\n\n6. These well-documented exclusions might actually serve as \"cover\" for less legitimate exclusions or manipulations elsewhere in the dataset - creating an appearance of thoroughness and transparency.\n\nThe proper exclusion of these two participants would be expected regardless of whether other forms of misconduct occurred elsewhere in the project. These particular exclusions appear methodologically sound based on the contemporaneous documentation, which would be the case whether or not Lena engaged in misconduct in other aspects of the study.\n\n85"

The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a serious violation of research integrity and proper preregistration procedures.\n2. The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above, which is a statistical fingerprint strongly associated with p-hacking.\n3. Lena expressed in emails that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" that \"a null result would kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and that she \"needs this one to work,\" establishing clear motivation.\n\nEvidence with mixed interpretations:\n1. An earlier analysis script included more participants than the final dataset. While participant exclusion is common, this could also indicate selective reporting.\n2. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria exist, similar to other lab members. This could represent either legitimate robustness checks or p-hacking opportunities.\n3. The software change and hard drive failure could explain some inconsistencies legitimately, but could also provide convenient cover for manipulations.\n\nEvidence suggesting proper research conduct:\n1. Lena has no prior record of data irregularities and previously passed an independent data audit with high marks.\n2. Two participants were excluded based on contemporaneously documented valid reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions).\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modified preregistration after data collection and the suspicious p-value distribution. These are difficult to explain through innocent means and align with the explicit career pressure documented in Lena's emails. While some aspects of her research appear to follow proper protocols, the core evidence strongly suggests intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n80"
