  "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the evidence presented, I believe that Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes: the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below the significance threshold; the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes; and the pattern of participant exclusions between script versions. These represent serious methodological violations that are difficult to explain through legitimate research practices.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors, such as the lab-wide robustness testing initiative and her previously clean record, they are outweighed by the specific patterns of data manipulation that align with classic signatures of p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\nThe evidence suggests Lena likely responded to the documented career and funding pressures by engaging in questionable research practices that crossed the line into misconduct.\n\nYes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct."
