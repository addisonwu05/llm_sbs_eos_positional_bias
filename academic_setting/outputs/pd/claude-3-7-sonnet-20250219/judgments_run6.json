  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nBased on the evidence, while there are some suspicious elements like the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and his inconsistent statements, the stronger evidence points away from Alex being responsible. The timing evidence showing Alex badged out before the critical error, the documented history of similar failures with this printer model, Alex's proactive reporting of issues days earlier, and the security footage of Jamie's rough handling provide a more compelling alternative explanation. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the printer likely failed due to its known mechanical issues, potentially exacerbated by Jamie's actions, rather than anything Alex did."
