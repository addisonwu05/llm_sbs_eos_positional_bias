  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence against Alex's involvement is the building access logs showing he left the building 7 minutes before the critical error occurred. This physical alibi is strongly supported by the printer's own error log timing.\n\nAdditionally, several alternative explanations exist for the printer failure:\n\n1. The security footage showing Jamie pulling forcefully on jammed paper\n2. The printer model's documented history of similar failures in other departments\n3. The known issues with the printer's fuser unit\n\nAlex's proactive reporting of the grinding noise three days earlier and history of properly reporting equipment issues also suggest responsible behavior rather than someone who would damage office equipment.\n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence exists (like the plastic fragments and Alex's expressed frustration), these don't overcome the timing evidence and alternative explanations."
