  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct. The modified preregistration document after data collection and the suspicious p-value distribution (many just below .05, few just above) are particularly damning indicators that are difficult to explain through innocent means. These statistical patterns combined with her expressed career concerns and the changes in participant exclusion between analysis versions strongly suggest deliberate manipulation of data or analyses to achieve favorable results. While some evidence like the hardware failure and her previously clean record provide mitigating context, they don't adequately explain the core problematic patterns in the data and documentation.\n\nYes"
