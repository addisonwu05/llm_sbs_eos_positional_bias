  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, there are more compelling explanations for the printer failure than Alex breaking it. The documented history of this exact printer model failing in the same way in other departments, Jamie's rough handling captured on security footage, and Alex's physical absence from the building when the error occurred all provide stronger alternative explanations. \n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence raises questions about Alex (the plastic fragments, proximity to the printer before leaving), these are outweighed by Alex's history of properly reporting equipment issues and the existence of multiple more plausible causes for the failure that don't involve Alex."
