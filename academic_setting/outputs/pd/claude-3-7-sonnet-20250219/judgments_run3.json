  "Based on my analysis of the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- The modified preregistration document after data collection (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes)\n- The statistically suspicious pattern of p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above\n- The documented motivation and pressure in her emails about needing the study to work\n- The pattern of participant exclusions between earlier and final datasets\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate participant exclusions, the statistical anomalies and altered preregistration are particularly difficult to explain through innocent means. These represent fundamental violations of scientific research principles that align with classic patterns of data manipulation.\n\nThe evidence collectively points to research practices that go beyond honest mistakes or poor record-keeping and indicate intentional manipulation to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nYes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct."
