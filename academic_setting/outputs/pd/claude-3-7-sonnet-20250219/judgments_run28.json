  "Yes, I think Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that Lena engaged in p-hacking and selective reporting practices that constitute academic misconduct. The most compelling indicators include the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, and the selective exclusion of participants between analysis versions. These methodological manipulations align perfectly with her explicitly stated motivations about needing the study to \"work\" for her career prospects. While there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate exclusions, they are insufficient to explain the pattern of irregularities that specifically served to produce statistically significant results."
