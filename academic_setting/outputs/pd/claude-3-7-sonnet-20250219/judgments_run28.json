  "No\n\nWhile there is circumstantial evidence suggesting Alex may have been involved (the plastic fragments in the trash, being near the printer shortly before failure, and the inconsistent statements), there are also compelling alternative explanations:\n\n1. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments\n2. Security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier\n3. Alex was not physically present when the critical error occurred\n4. Alex had previously reported the printer's issues properly\n5. Alex has a consistent history of responsibly reporting equipment problems\n\nThese factors, especially the printer's known defects and the evidence of another person's mishandling, create reasonable doubt about Alex's culpability. The evidence suggests the printer likely failed due to a combination of its inherent defects and possibly Jamie's rough handling rather than deliberate action by Alex."
