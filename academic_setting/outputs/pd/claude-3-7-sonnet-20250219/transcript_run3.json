The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

There are many legitimate reasons for participant exclusion:\n\n1. Participants who didn't follow instructions properly\n2. Participants who failed attention or manipulation checks\n3. Participants who had excessive artifacts in their data (especially relevant in neuroscience)\n4. Participants who fell outside pre-registered inclusion criteria (e.g., age ranges, clinical status)\n5. Outliers whose data significantly deviate from the normal distribution\n6. Technical issues during data collection\n\nThe key factor is whether these exclusions were based on principled criteria that were ideally specified in advance, rather than being selected to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nFor a cognitive neuroscience study with 80 participants, having some excluded participants is actually expected rather than suspicious. What would make this more or less concerning would be:\n- Whether the exclusion criteria were documented and justified\n- Whether the exclusions were reported transparently in the final paper\n- Whether the exclusions appeared to be systematically biased toward producing the desired result\n\nWithout misconduct, finding an earlier script with more participants who were later legitimately excluded would be very common. Researchers typically start with all collected data and then apply exclusion criteria, creating different versions of analysis scripts as they refine their approach.\n\nProbability: 90"

It's common knowledge among researchers that positive, publishable results help secure future funding.

This creates both direct pressure from authority and a sense of obligation to her supervisor.\n\n2. **Career self-interest**: By explicitly stating \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" she's documenting her understanding of the personal career consequences of negative findings.

This outcome-focused framing, rather than process-focused integrity, is consistent with someone who might justify misconduct.\n\nThese statements collectively create a perfect psychological recipe for rationalization of misconduct: external pressure from authority, personal career consequences, and a results-oriented mindset.

Neither distribution naturally produces a sharp discontinuity around p = .05.\n\n2. **Statistical implausibility**: The probability of multiple exploratory analyses coincidentally yielding results that cluster just below the significance threshold (.041-.049) while having almost none just above (.051-.059) is mathematically very low without some form of selection or manipulation.\n\n3. **Exploratory analyses characteristics**: Exploratory analyses in particular should show a wide range of p-values.

These are universally accepted reasons for participant exclusion across psychology and neuroscience.\n\n2. **Real-time documentation**: The fact that these issues were noted in the raw data files at the time they occurred (predating journal submission) suggests proper contemporaneous documentation of problems during data collection, which is a hallmark of good research practice.\n\n3. **Transparent record-keeping**: Maintaining clear notes about participant behavior and comprehension issues in the raw data files demonstrates appropriate transparency in handling exclusions, rather than post-hoc justification.\n\n4. **Small, reasonable exclusion rate**: Two participants from a sample of 80 represents only 2.5% of the sample, which is a very reasonable and expected exclusion rate for cognitive tasks. This low rate doesn't suggest systematic removal of data to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n5. **Legitimate cognitive neuroscience concerns**: For a cognitive neuroscience study specifically, participant alertness and task comprehension are essential for valid data. A participant falling asleep during a memory task would generate meaningless data that would contaminate results if included.\n\nThis situation describes exactly how a careful, methodical researcher should handle participant issues: documenting problems as they occur, making exclusion decisions based on clear behavioral issues, and maintaining a record of these decisions in the original data files.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it's still quite likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\nThis pattern would be compatible with misconduct for several reasons:\n\n1. **Legitimate exclusions can coexist with misconduct**: Even researchers who engage in questionable practices typically make some legitimate exclusions. Participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions genuinely should be excluded, regardless of whether other aspects of the research involve misconduct.\n\n2. **Documentation practices can be mixed**: A researcher might properly document legitimate exclusions while still engaging in other forms of data manipulation. Maintaining some proper documentation practices could help disguise other problematic behaviors.\n\n3. **Small number of legitimate exclusions**: While these two exclusions appear proper, they don't preclude the possibility that other participants were inappropriately excluded without similar documentation, or that other forms of data manipulation occurred.\n\n4. **Strategic documentation**: Someone committing misconduct might be particularly careful to thoroughly document legitimate exclusions to establish credibility, while being less transparent about other analytical decisions.\n\n5. **Different types of misconduct**: The misconduct might have occurred in other aspects of the research (such as the p-values clustered just below .05 or the changed preregistration) rather than in these specific participant exclusions.\n\nThese proper exclusions represent normal research practice that would likely occur whether or not other aspects of the research involved misconduct. Having contemporaneous documentation for excluding participants who fell asleep or misunderstood instructions is exactly what we would expect to see in both honest and dishonest research, as these are objectively invalid data points.\n\nProbability: 85"

    "content": "Based on the evidence presented, I need to weigh several factors suggesting misconduct against those suggesting innocent explanations.\n\nEvidence strongly suggesting misconduct:\n1. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 - This pattern is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking that is mathematically improbable without manipulation.\n2. The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - This directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration and suggests results-driven analytical decisions.\n3. Emails expressing pressure for positive results (\"need this one to work\") - While not definitive alone, these establish clear motivation.\n4. Earlier analysis script showing excluded participants - This suggests potential selective inclusion/exclusion of data.\n\nEvidence suggesting possible innocence:\n1. Clean prior record with passed independent data audit - This shows Lena has a history of good research practices.\n2. The lab switched statistical software and there was a confirmed hard drive failure - This provides some explanation for potential data irregularities.\n3. Multiple analysis scripts were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative - This contextualizes what might otherwise look like p-hacking.\n4. Proper documentation of legitimate participant exclusions (sleeping/misunderstanding) - This shows some appropriate research practices.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The modified preregistration is particularly damning, as there are few innocent explanations for changing key analytical decisions after seeing data.\n- The p-value distribution is a statistical anomaly that's extremely difficult to explain without some form of data selection or manipulation.\n- While software changes and hard drive failures happen, they conveniently explain missing data that might show inconsistencies.\n- Prior good behavior doesn't preclude misconduct under pressure.\n\nTaking all evidence together, the statistical patterns and modified preregistration strongly indicate misconduct, despite some mitigating factors.\n\nProbability: 80"
