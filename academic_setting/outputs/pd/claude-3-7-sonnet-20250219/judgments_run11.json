  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nWhile there are suspicious elements like the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and their contradictory statements about using the printer, the evidence pointing to Alex's innocence is more compelling:\n\n1. The printer model has a documented history of identical failures without mishandling\n2. Alex proactively reported concerns about the printer days before the incident\n3. Security footage shows another employee (Jamie) handling the printer roughly\n4. Alex was verifiably out of the building when the final failure occurred\n5. Alex has an established pattern of properly reporting equipment issues\n\nThe technical context of a printer with known defects, combined with Alex's history of responsible behavior, suggests this was most likely a technical failure rather than deliberate or accidental damage by Alex."
