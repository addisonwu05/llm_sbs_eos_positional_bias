The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Pre-registered exclusion criteria being applied (e.g., participants who failed attention checks, had excessive missing data, or showed evidence of not following instructions)\n\n2. Discovery of technical issues with certain participants' data during quality control\n\n3. Identification of true outliers whose data would inappropriately skew results\n\n4. Refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria based on methodological considerations (though this should be transparently reported)\n\n5. Reviewer feedback suggesting more stringent participant criteria\n\nThe key factors that would make this innocent would be:\n- Documentation of the exclusion criteria\n- Consistency in applying these criteria\n- Transparency in reporting the exclusions\n- Changes that don't systematically bias toward the desired outcome\n\nWhat makes this scenario plausible as non-misconduct is the mentioned context about switching software and hard drive failures, which could explain documentation gaps. Additionally, Lena's previously strong record suggests she typically follows proper procedures.\n\nHowever, the fact that the whistleblower specifically noted that data \"looks too perfect\" raises concerns about whether the exclusions were made to achieve favorable results rather than for methodologically sound reasons.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be fairly likely that there would be legitimate participant exclusions between analysis versions, as this is a normal part of the research process when done transparently and with justification.\n\n70"

Post-hoc exclusion: Rather than following pre-registered or methodologically justified exclusion criteria, she might have examined individual participants' data and selectively removed those who didn't support the hypothesis.\n\n3. Creating \"clean\" results: The whistleblower's claim that the data \"look too perfect\" suggests potential removal of messier data points or outliers specifically to create more compelling, publication-ready results.\n\n4. Covering tracks: The convenient \"hard drive failure\" explanation could be used to avoid providing raw data or documentation of exclusion decisions.\n\n5. Responding to reviewer pressure: The allegation that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers' comments\" suggests potential misconduct in response to publication pressure.\n\nThis pattern—having an earlier version with more participants and a \"cleaner\" final version with selective exclusions—is precisely what data forensics often looks for in fraud investigations. The excluded participants would likely be those whose data contradicted the hypothesis, rather than those excluded based on legitimate methodological criteria.\n\nGiven the high-pressure context (prestigious publication, grant review), the whistleblower's specific concerns about data looking \"too perfect,\" and the discovery of differing participant counts between versions, if Lena did commit misconduct, selective participant exclusion would be an extremely likely component of that misconduct.\n\n95"

P-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects.\n\n2.

The number of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .04-.049) should be roughly similar to the number just above .05 (e.g., .051-.06), as statistical noise doesn't respect arbitrary human thresholds.\n\nThe pattern described represents what statisticians call the \"p-curve cliff\" or \"p-hacking cliff\" - a telltale sign of selective analysis or reporting practices.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be highly consistent with modern robust research practices, especially in the context of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness.\"\n\nThis pattern reflects several positive methodological developments in scientific research:\n\n1. **Multiverse analysis**: Running analyses with different reasonable exclusion criteria has become a recommended practice to test whether findings are sensitive to specific analytical decisions. This approach acknowledges that many researcher decisions are arbitrary.\n\n2. **Sensitivity testing**: Exploring how results change under different exclusion criteria helps researchers understand the stability and reliability of their findings.\n\n3. **Transparency in analytical flexibility**: Documenting multiple analysis approaches represents greater transparency compared to only preserving a single \"final\" analysis.\n\n4. **Lab-wide methodological initiatives**: The fact this was part of a \"lab-wide push\" suggests an institutionalized commitment to robust methods rather than individual exploration.\n\n5. **Peer consistency**: The similar pattern observed across multiple students indicates a standardized lab practice rather than unusual behavior by Lena.\n\nIn contemporary research methods, particularly following the replication crisis, many labs have adopted explicit robustness checks as standard practice. The Center for Open Science and other methodological reform organizations actively encourage researchers to test multiple reasonable analysis pathways.\n\nThe key distinction from p-hacking is that these alternative analyses were transparently preserved in lab records rather than selectively reported. This documentation suggests an open approach to exploring analytical flexibility rather than hiding it.\n\nThis pattern of behavior would be exactly what we'd expect from a conscientious researcher following current best practices for robust analysis in a lab that values methodological rigor.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria in the lab's data management logs could actually serve as both cover and mechanism for her fraudulent activities, while still appearing similar to her peers' work.\n\nThis pattern could fit with misconduct in several ways:\n\n1. **Disguised p-hacking**: Running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria is precisely how p-hacking operates - trying various analytical approaches until finding one that yields desired results. The lab-wide robustness initiative would provide perfect cover for this behavior.\n\n2. **Plausible deniability**: If questioned about why she tried numerous analytical approaches, Lena could point to the lab's explicit encouragement of exploring multiple analyses as justification.\n\n3. **Selective reporting**: While the logs show she ran many analyses (similar to peers), misconduct could involve only reporting the favorable ones while appearing to follow lab norms.\n\n4. **Camouflaged manipulation**: The similarity to other students' practices provides excellent camouflage - her analytical exploration looks quantitatively similar to peers but could be qualitatively different in motivation.\n\n5. **Strategic use of legitimate practices**: Many research fraudsters embed their misconduct within otherwise legitimate research practices, making detection more difficult.\n\nThe key distinction between honest robustness testing and misconduct isn't in the number of analyses run, but in:\n- Whether the final analytical choices were made based on results rather than methodological justifications\n- Whether all analyses were transparently reported or only favorable ones\n- Whether the multiple analyses were pre-planned or represent post-hoc exploration\n\nIn a research environment where multiple analyses are encouraged, a researcher committing misconduct would naturally generate analysis logs similar to peers. The misconduct would lie in how those multiple analyses were used in the final reporting, not in their mere existence.\n\nThis scenario actually represents an especially sophisticated form of potential misconduct - one that leverages open science practices as cover for questionable research practices.\n\n85"

Preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - a serious violation of research integrity principles\n2. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above - a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking\n3. Emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" - revealing motivation and pressure\n4. Earlier analysis script showing excluded participants - suggesting potential selective data use\n\nEvidence suggesting possible innocence:\n\n1. Clean prior record with passed independent audit - suggesting established good practices\n2. Confirmed technical issues (software switch and hard drive failure) - providing legitimate explanation for some irregularities\n3. Lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses for robustness - contextualizing her multiple scripts\n4. Proper documentation of legitimate exclusions (sleeping participants) - showing appropriate research practices\n\nWeighing these factors:\n\nThe modified preregistration and unusual p-value distribution are particularly damning, as they represent objective evidence of practices that fundamentally undermine research integrity. These are difficult to explain through honest mistakes or legitimate research practices.\n\nThe emails show clear motivation but could represent common academic pressure rather than intent to defraud.\n\nHer clean prior record suggests she knows proper practices but doesn't preclude first-time misconduct under unusual pressure.\n\nThe technical issues and lab practices provide context that could explain some irregularities but don't address the most serious concerns about preregistration changes and p-value distribution.\n\nConsidering all evidence holistically, there are multiple serious red flags that are difficult to explain through legitimate means, alongside some mitigating factors that don't fully counter the strongest evidence of misconduct.\n\n75"
