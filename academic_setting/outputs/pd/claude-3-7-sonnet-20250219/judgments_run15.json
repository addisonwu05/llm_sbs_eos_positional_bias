  "Based on the totality of evidence presented, my assessment is:\n\nYes\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like the confirmed hardware failure and lab-wide practices of running multiple analyses, the most compelling evidence points toward academic misconduct. The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a statistical anomaly that strongly indicates p-hacking. This, combined with the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria, suggests deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results. Lena's emails provide clear motivation for such actions, establishing both means and motive for misconduct. These core issues cannot be adequately explained by the technical difficulties or standard research practices described in the case."
