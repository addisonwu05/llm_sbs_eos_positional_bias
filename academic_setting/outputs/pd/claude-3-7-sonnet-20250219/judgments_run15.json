  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence against Alex being responsible is the badge record showing Alex left the building at 5:12pm, while the printer's error log shows the critical failure occurred at 5:19pm - seven minutes after Alex was physically gone from the premises. This creates a strong alibi.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple plausible alternative explanations for the printer's failure:\n- The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments\n- Security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier that day\n- The printer has a known issue with its defective fuser unit\n\nAlex's history of responsibly reporting equipment issues (including emailing about this printer's problems three days earlier) also suggests someone concerned about maintaining equipment rather than damaging it.\n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence initially pointed toward Alex (fragments in trash, expressed frustration), the timeline evidence and documented printer defects provide stronger support for the conclusion that Alex did not break the printer."
