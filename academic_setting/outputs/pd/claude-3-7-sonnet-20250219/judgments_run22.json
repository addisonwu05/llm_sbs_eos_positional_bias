  "Based on the totality of evidence presented, I believe:\n\nNo\n\nWhile there are concerning patterns in the evidence, including the modified preregistration document, unusual p-value distribution, and emails expressing outcome pressure, there are also several mitigating factors. Lena has a clean prior record with well-documented reproducible work, the lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses suggests a culture of robustness testing rather than individual misconduct, there are verified technical explanations for some inconsistencies, and proper documentation exists for legitimate participant exclusions. \n\nWithout definitive proof that modifications were made specifically to manipulate outcomes rather than address genuine methodological concerns, and considering her previously established record of research integrity, I cannot conclude with sufficient confidence that Lena committed intentional academic misconduct."
