When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Printers are notorious for causing frustration, and people often vent about them. The fact that coworkers reacted with laughing emojis suggests they recognized this as typical office venting rather than a serious threat.\n\nIf Alex didn't break the printer, this post would actually be consistent with their experience:\n- They were genuinely experiencing printer jams (confirmed in the scenario)\n- They were openly frustrated, not hiding their feelings\n- The printer eventually did fail, but due to other causes (potentially Jamie's actions or the known defective fuser unit)\n\nIn fact, someone who had secret intentions to damage the printer might be less likely to publicly announce their frustration, as it would later create suspicion (exactly as happened). The post creates a record connecting Alex to the printer problems.\n\nPeople regularly express hyperbolic frustration about malfunctioning office equipment without acting on it. The phrase \"going to lose it\" is rarely meant literally. Given that the printer was already showing problems (jamming repeatedly), Alex's complaint appears to be a normal response to an annoying situation.\n\nTaking all this into account, if Alex did not break the printer, it seems quite likely they would have made such a post given the circumstances described.\n\nProbability: 80"

It allows Alex to test whether a complete denial will be accepted, then adjust to a more defensible position when necessary.\n\nFor someone who broke the printer, this approach serves to maintain distance from the time of damage while adapting to the developing investigation.\n\nProbability: 85"

The security footage would show one part of a sequence where the printer was struggling throughout the day before Alex ultimately caused the critical failure.\n\nThe footage itself would exist independently of Alex's later actions, as it simply captures a normal (if somewhat rough) interaction with a problematic printer earlier in the day.\n\nProbability: 75"

The seven-minute gap provides objective evidence that Alex wasn't present at the moment of failure, which would be expected if the printer failed due to mechanical issues or Jamie's earlier handling.\n\nProbability: 90"

If Alex damaged the printer right before leaving, we would expect exactly this pattern: physical damage, followed by Alex's departure, followed by the system eventually detecting and logging the critical error minutes later.\n\nThe sequence creates a technically plausible scenario where Alex could cause damage but not be present when the system officially records the failure.\n\nProbability: 90"

Alex posted about frustration with the printer, saying they'd \"lose it\" if it jammed again\n2. Alex initially denied using the printer that day, then changed their story\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken printer were found in Alex's trash\n4. A coworker saw Alex at the printer minutes before it stopped working\n5. Alex was physically near the printer close to when the damage must have occurred\n\n**Evidence suggesting Alex did not break the printer:**\n1. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling\n2. Security footage shows Jamie handling the printer roughly before the failure\n3. Alex proactively reported the printer's grinding noise days earlier\n4. Alex has an established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment issues\n5. Alex was demonstrably out of the building when the error was actually logged\n6. Alex's proximity to the printer could be explained by normal use\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n- The plastic fragments in Alex's trash are highly incriminating\n- Alex's contradictory statements about using the printer suggest deception\n- However, the printer had known issues, and Jamie's rough handling provides an alternative explanation\n- Alex's proactive reporting of issues contradicts the profile of someone who would intentionally damage equipment\n- The timing of events (Alex leaving before the error log) could work either way\n\nMost significantly, the combination of Alex's frustration, their presence at the printer shortly before failure, their contradictory statements, and especially the plastic fragments in their trash creates a compelling pattern.\n\nWhile there are alternative explanations (Jamie's handling, the printer's known defects), the totality of evidence points more toward Alex's responsibility, though with significant uncertainty.\n\nProbability: 70"
