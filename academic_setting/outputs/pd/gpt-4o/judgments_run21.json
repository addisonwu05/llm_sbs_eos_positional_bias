  "Given the complexity and nuances of the information provided, I am unable to definitively determine whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The evidence presents both potential indicators of misconduct and explanations that point to standard research practices or unintentional errors. Therefore, without further investigation or conclusive evidence, it's not possible to definitively answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to whether Lena committed academic misconduct."
