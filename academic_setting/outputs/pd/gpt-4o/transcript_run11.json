The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Modifying a preregistration document after data collection is a notable red flag, as one of the main purposes of preregistration is to prevent researchers from making changes that could bias the results based on the data. It is generally expected that key aspects of a study, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, are specified before data collection begins to ensure transparency and credibility.\n\nHowever, there are legitimate reasons why a preregistration document might be modified post-data collection without implying misconduct:\n\n1. **Software or Documentation Issues**: If the lab had recently switched software, it's possible that some data-related documentation, including timestamps and file tracking, got disrupted.\n\n2. **Clarification Adjustments**: Sometimes researchers realize their original preregistered plans were unclear or erroneously specified, necessitating minor clarifications. Although best practice would involve documenting and justifying these changes transparently, some labs may not follow optimal procedures.\n\n3. **Unforseen Data Issues**: During the data collection or early analysis phases, legitimate issues (like incorrect data entries or unforeseen technical anomalies) might necessitate a reconsideration of some criteria that were initially missed.\n\n4. **Revisions Due to Feedback**: Feedback from team members or previous experiences might lead to a justified reconsideration of methods if discovered after data collection, though ideally before data analysis begins.\n\nGiven these potential explanations, it is possible that the modifications in the preregistration could be due to non-malicious reasons rather than misconduct. However, considering the importance and convention of preregistration, the likelihood of such modifications occurring under completely genuine circumstances (without affecting the study's integrity) is relatively low, but not negligible. Proper documentation of the reasons for changes would strengthen the case for innocence, but without that, some level of concern remains warranted.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30"

    "content": "If Lena engaged in academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be a likely action. This is because:\n\n1. **Post-Hoc Adjustments**: A common form of misconduct involves retrospectively adjusting aspects of the study design or analysis to align the findings with desired outcomes. By altering exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after examining the data, a researcher can present results that appear more strongly supportive of their hypotheses.\n\n2. **Enhancing Publishability**: Under pressure to produce publishable findings, such modifications could be a deliberate attempt to fabricate or alter data such that they yield cleaner, more statistically significant results. Changing the preregistration retrospectively would be a strategy to conceal this intention.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks**: By modifying the preregistration document, a researcher might attempt to cover their tracks and create the illusion of methodological consistency, despite the changes being driven by the data already observed.\n\n4. **Manipulating Review Process**: After receiving feedback from preliminary reviews, deliberate changes to the document might be made to reinforce or strengthen the paper's alignment with reviewer expectations or criticisms.\n\nThus, if misconduct did occur, altering the preregistration document post-data collection is a likely action since it serves the purpose of artificially supporting the study's outcomes, increasing the probability that these changes were made with intentional deceit.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

However, there are non-misconduct-related reasons that could potentially lead to this pattern:\n\n1. **Random Variability**: Although unlikely, random chance could in theory produce a pattern where p-values are clustered just below .05, especially in a smaller dataset or one with complex analyses.\n\n2. **Exploratory Nature**: In exploratory research, researchers often conduct many analyses, increasing the likelihood of happening upon significant results by chance. However, such a pattern, especially when isolated just below .05, is still expected to be more balanced around that threshold.\n\n3. **Analytical Approach**: Some complex statistical models or settings might naturally yield p-values closer to 0.05 due to sample size, effect sizes close to the detectable limits, or particular modeling features.\n\n4. **Threshold Optimization**: There's a possibility (though not ethical or standard practice) that unconscious biases or legitimate iterative testing may lead researchers to stop once a \"just significant\" p-value is obtained, even without deliberate misconduct.\n\nStill, the pattern of p-values being mostly sub-.05 and clustered around it, especially within exploratory contexts, significantly raises the likelihood of biased analysis practices.

However, experiencing pressure and expressing concerns about career implications do not inherently imply that misconduct occurred.

Expressing anxiety about these pressures is typical and does not necessarily correlate with unethical behavior.\n\n2. **Venting Frustrations**: Lena's emails could be a form of venting or seeking emotional support from a friend. Acknowledging pressure or expressing a desire for a successful outcome is natural in private communications and doesn't imply that she'll resort to misconduct to achieve it.\n\n3. **Motivational Language**: Phrasing like “I need this one to work” may be motivational rather than indicative of intent to fabricate or falsify data.
