  "Based on the information provided and the complexity of the factors involved, it's not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The presence of both suspicious elements (like post-data collection modifications and clustered significant p-values) and legitimate explanations or strong aspects of her research history make it a nuanced situation. However, without more conclusive evidence of deliberate data manipulation or fabrication, a definitive \"Yes\" or \"No\" cannot be responsibly determined."
