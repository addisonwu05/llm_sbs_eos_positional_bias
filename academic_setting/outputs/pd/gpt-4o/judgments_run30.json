  "Based on the available information and considering both the evidence for and against the likelihood of misconduct, it is not possible to conclusively determine if Lena committed academic misconduct. The evidence presents plausible arguments for both sides, with significant emphasis on external pressures, potential procedural errors, and her past reliable work record. Therefore, without further definitive evidence, indicating a decisive \"Yes\" or \"No\" would be speculative.\n\nNo definitive conclusion can be reached with the given data."
