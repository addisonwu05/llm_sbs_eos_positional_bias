    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The situation you're describing is indicative of a potential issue often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or data dredging, where researchers consciously or unconsciously manipulate their statistical analyses to obtain p-values below the conventional significance threshold of 0.05. This can involve multiple testing, selective reporting of favorable results, or even adjusting data collection or analysis methods post hoc to achieve significant p-values.\n\nStatistically, p-values should be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. Therefore, in a genuinely exploratory or confirmatory dataset without misconduct, you'd expect as many p-values just above the threshold (e.g., .051, .055, .060) as you would just below (e.g., .045, .049, .048). A clustering of p-values just below 0.05 and a scarcity of p-values just above it could raise red flags. \n\nHowever, if Lena reports the irregularities stemmed from honest mistakes, software changes, or statistical methodology issues without the intention to deceive, it's essential to consider mechanisms through which these could lead to the observed pattern. For instance:\n1. **Software or Methodological Changes**: Switching data analysis software could account for some differences, especially if newer methods or corrections were introduced inadvertently and led to uniformly lower p-values.\n2. **Multiple Comparisons and Selective Reporting**: Without proper correction for multiple comparisons, some p-values can inadvertently appear significant. However, this often affects both tails of the p-value distribution, unless selective reporting or stopping rules are applied.\n3. **Data Handling Mistakes**: Missing files or data mismanagement could lead to skewed results, although it is less likely that these mistakes would consistently favor just significant results.\n\nGiven Lena's strong prior record and the stated factors like software changes and data loss, which could plausibly contribute to anomaly without misconduct, it is theoretically possible, though statistically less likely, for these results to occur by chance. The outcome strongly depends on context, the nature of the exploratory analyses, and the discipline's standard practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This pattern is a common signature of p-hacking, where analyses are manipulated to achieve statistically significant results.\n\nResearchers engaged in misconduct might selectively report results, adjust their analysis strategies, or attempt multiple variations of the analysis until they obtain p-values that meet the conventional significance criterion. This process can involve:\n1. **Selective Reporting**: Only reporting analyses that yield p-values below 0.05.\n2. **Adjusting Analyses**: Modifying analytical methods, sometimes subtly, until a desired p-value is achieved.\n3. **Data Manipulation**: Deliberately altering the dataset, such as adding or removing observations or selectively managing outliers.\n\nThese practices can result in a distribution of p-values that is skewed towards significance, especially clustered just below the 0.05 mark, while p-values just above it are downplayed or omitted. Such a distribution is often indicative of intentional efforts to influence the results to appear significant, supporting the hypothesis in question.\n\nTherefore, if academic misconduct occurred, the likelihood of observing this pattern in the dataset is quite high, as it directly aligns with the typical goals of manipulating analysis outcomes to fabricate significance.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
