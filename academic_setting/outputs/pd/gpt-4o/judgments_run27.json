  "Based on the information provided, it is challenging to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The evidence includes factors that could suggest misconduct, such as the distribution of p-values and changes made to preregistration documents. However, there are also plausible explanations for these findings that do not involve misconduct, such as technical issues, standard robustness checks, and prior clean audits. \n\nThus, without more definitive evidence, I would conclude:\n\nNo, the decision based on the current evidence does not strongly indicate that Lena committed academic misconduct."
