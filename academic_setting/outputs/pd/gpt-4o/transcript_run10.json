The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This occurs when researchers consciously or unconsciously manipulate their data analysis until they get significant results, often leading to an accumulation of p-values just below the conventional threshold of .05. This can occur through multiple testing, trying different models, or selectively reporting certain outcomes. While this is more common than outright data fabrication, it does not indicate fraud per se but rather questionable research practices.\n\nIf Lena did not engage in p-hacking or misconduct, there are a few potential explanations for the pattern of p-values:\n1. **Random Chance**: In a large number of analyses, it is statistically possible, although unlikely, that you would have many p-values just below .05 purely by chance.\n2. **Subconscious Biases**: Lena might have unconsciously made analytic decisions that favored significant results without realizing a pattern was forming.\n3. **Systematic Issues**: Software changes or errors could potentially lead to systematic biases in data analysis.\n4. **Sampling Bias**: The sample might present some unique features that resulted in this distribution of p-values.\n\nHowever, the pattern you describe (an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above it) is often indicative of selection, such as p-hacking, because random chance would typically produce a more uniform distribution of p-values around the .05 threshold.\n\nGiven the lack of p-values just above .05, if Lena had acted without misconduct, such a pattern would be quite unlikely. The existence of multiple analyses often leans towards the suggestion that results were influenced, knowingly or unknowingly, toward significance, especially given the publication pressures she faced.\n\nAs a probability judgment, considering the context, I'd estimate the likelihood of such a pattern emerging purely by chance or honest error without misconduct as being quite low.\n\nProbability judgment: 15"
