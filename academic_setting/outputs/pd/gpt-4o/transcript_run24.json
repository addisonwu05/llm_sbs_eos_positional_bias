The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Modifying a preregistration document after data collection is a significant concern in scientific research. Preregistration is intended to establish a clear plan for how a study will be conducted and analyzed before seeing the data, thereby reducing biases such as data dredging or p-hacking. However, there can still be legitimate reasons for modifications, although they should always be clearly documented and justified.\n\nSeveral possible mundane explanations for modifications to a preregistration document include:\n\n1. **Clerical Error or Oversight**: Lena or someone in the lab might have simply forgotten to finalize certain aspects of the preregistration before data collection, only realizing after the fact.\n\n2. **Software or File Management Changes**: The lab recently switched software, which could have led to unintentional modifications or updates to document timestamps. Additionally, a hard drive failure might have necessitated retrieving or reconstructing files from backups, accidentally updating timestamps in the process.\n\n3. **Protocol Amendments**: Sometimes, changes might be warranted due to unforeseen circumstances during data collection or analysis. However, these should be documented transparently, explaining the rationale for any deviations from the preregistered plan.\n\n4. **Genuine Miscommunication**: Lena might have misunderstood the exact nature and purpose of preregistration or failed to communicate certain changes adequately due to lack of experience or pressure to deliver results.\n\nWhile these explanations could account for some or all of the modifications, the practice of changing key elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post hoc is risky and often considered suspect unless well-justified.\n\nProbability judgment: If assuming no misconduct, there's a relatively low probability that such significant changes to the preregistration would occur unwittingly, as researchers are generally aware of the importance of adhering to the initial plan. Nevertheless, given the possibility of honest mistakes or miscommunication, it's not zero.\n\nProbability judgment: 25"

This pattern is consistent with attempts to manipulate data to achieve more favorable results.

By selectively removing data points that don't fit the desired outcome, she could present a more compelling case for the findings.\n\n2. **P-Hacking**: To achieve significant results, Lena might have engaged in p-hacking, which involves trying multiple analyses or selectively excluding data until significant findings are obtained. This process can involve running initial analyses on a larger dataset and then gradually excluding participants who negatively impact the results.\n\n3. **Avoiding Anomalous Data**: Participants whose data deviate from expected patterns might be excluded to make the dataset appear more consistent and \"clean.\" This can enhance the perceived validity of the results even if it's done inappropriately.\n\n4. **Creating a Narrative**: By excluding certain participants, Lena could alter the narrative of the research to make it more publishable and convincing, especially under pressure to deliver noteworthy outcomes before a major grant review.\n\n5. **Previous Misconduct Practices**: If Lena has fabricated or falsified data before, she may follow a similar pattern of manipulating datasets to ensure success.\n\nGiven these motivations, the likelihood of participant exclusion from an earlier dataset as part of misconduct is considerable.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

Here are some reasons why this may happen:\n\n1. **Covering Misconduct with Standard Practices**: Lena could use standard practices of running multiple analyses to mask selective reporting or p-hacking. Having a range of analyses gives room to choose results that fit a narrative.\n\n2. **Indistinguishable from Norms**: In a lab where running multiple scripts is common, it would not necessarily stand out as misconduct. Lena could engage in selective practices that blend into routine data exploration.\n\n3. **Exploratory Misconduct**: If Lena was exploring different exclusion criteria, she may have been testing various methods to see which configuration produces the most favorable or significant results, a form of exploratory misconduct when done with intent to deceive.\n\n4. **Peer Practices as a Shield**: If other students are following similar processes without misconduct intentions, Lena’s actions would be less scrutinized, relying on the generalized perception of routine robustness checks.\n\n5. **Operational Context**: Within a lab environment that emphasizes extensive analysis, misconduct involving selective report choices might be implemented under the guise of such thorough exploration.\n\nWhile misconduct changes the interpretation of her intent, it doesn’t necessarily alter the likelihood of the actions themselves, given that these practices are lab-wide and encouraged.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "Assessing the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct involves weighing the various pieces of evidence provided, alongside their context and implications:\n\n1. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: The change in the preregistration document post-data collection raises concerns but could be explained by honest errors or miscommunication, although atypical in rigorous academic research.\n\n2. **Exclusion of Participants and Analysis Patterns**: The exclusion of participants who fell asleep or misunderstood tasks seems legitimate given documented notes, while the unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 is more suspicious.\n\n3. **Email Content**: Lena’s emails expressing pressure do highlight potential motivations for misconduct, yet are common in academia without necessarily indicating unethical behavior.\n\n4. **Technical Incidents**: The switch in software and hard drive failure are documented occurrences that can explain some data management issues without implying wrongdoing.\n\n5. **Previous Research Integrity**: Lena's past adherence to rigorous standards decreases the likelihood of misconduct, suggesting any issues in the current study might be circumstantial or isolated.\n\n6. **Lab Practices**: Running multiple analyses aligns with lab-wide norms for robustness checks, weakening suspicions of misconduct for this practice alone.\n\nConsidering all these points, the overall probability leans towards misconduct being possible due to some suspicious patterns, but not highly probable given numerous legitimate explanations for much of the behavior described.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
