The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The pattern of p-values described, with an unusually high concentration just below .05 and very few just above it, can be indicative of p-hacking or other questionable research practices. P-hacking involves manipulating data analysis until statistically significant results are obtained, often by selective reporting, multiple testing, or other methods.\n\nIn a typical, well-conducted series of analyses, p-values should be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. This means that the probability of obtaining a p-value just below .05 should be roughly equal to obtaining a p-value just above .05 if there were no underlying effect and all assumptions of the statistical tests were met.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to this pattern appearing without misconduct:\n\n1. **Multiple Testing**: Conducting a large number of statistical tests increases the chance of some results being significant purely by chance, though this typically doesn't create the skew seen here unless there is selective reporting.\n\n2. **Analysis Choices**: Differences in analysis decisions (e.g., how data were processed, which participants were included) could affect p-values, although again, this typically results in less systematic skewing of p-values.\n\n3. **Software Changes**: The transition to new software might introduce variability in how analyses are conducted, but explaining a consistent pattern such as this through software alone would be unusual.\n\n4. **Data Characteristics**: If the data genuinely reflect a borderline but real effect, significant findings might cluster below .05. This scenario might be more plausible if the hypothesized effects are weak and just detectable with the study's sample size.\n\n5. **File Loss and Miscommunication**: These could lead to incomplete analysis records, making it challenging to see the full picture of data handling and potentially obscuring legitimate outcomes.\n\nWhile these explanations could account for some irregularities, the specific clustering of p-values just below .05 is often considered a red flag for some level of selective reporting or analysis manipulation. Thus, the likelihood that this pattern arises purely by chance, without any questionable research practices, in a dataset of this nature is low.\n\nOverall, given the statistical context and typical research practices, the likelihood that the described pattern would arise in the absence of any misconduct is modestly low, though not impossible, as real data can sometimes produce unexpected patterns especially with complex datasets.\n\nProbability judgment: 25"

This pattern is characteristic of practices like p-hacking, where the goal is to obtain p-values that are statistically significant (i.e., less than .05) to support a particular hypothesis.\n\nIndicators supporting this likelihood in the case of misconduct could include:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: Actively trying various combinations of data processing, statistical tests, or selective reporting until p-values fall just below the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Data Fabrication**: Intentionally creating or altering data points to achieve desired outcomes, which could result in an artificial clustering of p-values below the significance level.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Choosing to only report results that are significant, particularly those just below .05, while disregarding or omitting tests that yield non-significant p-values, such as those just above .05.\n\n4. **Responding to Pressure**: Given the high stakes of publishing results before a major grant review, there might be motivation to ensure the results appear favorable, potentially leading to misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if there was misconduct, the observed clustering of p-values is consistent with efforts to make results appear more significant than they may truly be.

    "content": "Assessing the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct involves weighing multiple factors and pieces of evidence, each of which offers its own context and implications:\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns of P-values**: The disproportionate concentration of p-values just below .05 is suggestive of possible p-hacking, though it might also arise from non-malicious data exploration.\n\n2. **Post Hoc Preregistration Changes**: Modifications to preregistration documents after data collection generally raise significant concerns regarding intentions to manipulate outcomes.\n\n3. **Participant Exclusions**: While excluding participants due to legitimate reasons (e.g., falling asleep) is standard practice, any perceived inconsistency in criteria application warrants scrutiny but alone is not definitive.\n\n4. **Technical and Administrative Challenges**: The overlap of software change and a documented hardware failure could appear suspicious but are plausible occurrences independently of misconduct.\n\n5. **Lab Norms**: The practice of running various analysis scripts is documented as part of lab culture, less directly suggestive of misconduct when seen as robustness checks.\n\n6. **History of Ethical Practice**: A previously strong record of data handling and successful audits supports Lena's credibility, suggesting a departure from misconduct.\n\n7. **Email Indications of Pressure**: Expressions of pressure to obtain significant results highlight strong motivations for misconduct but could merely reflect stress without illicit actions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the accumulated evidence suggests a degree of concern—particularly regarding the post hoc preregistration changes and email communications stressing external pressures—although significant uncertainty remains due to plausible and legitimate explanations for many discrepancies.\n\nOverall, the probability of misconduct cannot be definitively determined but could be estimated as moderately likely based on the confluence of evidence suggesting heightened risk factors.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

There are both indicators suggestive of misconduct and reasonable explanations consistent with legitimate research practices. Ultimately, a thorough investigation by relevant authorities would be necessary to make such a determination. Therefore, I cannot definitively say \"Yes\" or \"No.\""
