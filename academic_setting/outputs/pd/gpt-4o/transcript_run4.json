The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "In determining the likelihood of participants being excluded from the final dataset due to reasons other than academic misconduct, several legitimate factors could be considered:\n\n1. **Participant Exclusion Criteria**: In any study, participants may be excluded from the final analysis for valid reasons. This can include failing to meet inclusion criteria (e.g., not completing all study tasks, not meeting baseline cognitive thresholds), experiencing technical issues during data collection, or displaying outlier responses that could skew results (though decisions on outliers should always be made transparently and according to predefined criteria).\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Quality Control**: During data processing, some data points may be identified as problematic due to errors (e.g., sensor failures, incomplete responses) and removed to ensure data quality and integrity.\n\n3. **Software-Related Changes**: Given that the lab recently switched software, discrepancies between different dataset versions could arise due to changes in how data are imported, processed, or stored. This could lead to initial oversights in participant inclusion, later corrected upon review.\n\n4. **Supervisory Decisions**: Exclusions could have been recommended or mandated by Professor Mills or in response to feedback during manuscript preparation or review to align with methodological norms or improve the robustness of the findings.\n\n5. **Genuine Oversight**: In large datasets, especially those managed by a single individual, oversight in tracking participant data is possible and might result in inadvertent exclusions during draft iterations.\n\nConsidering these possibilities and the lack of direct evidence of misconduct, it is both plausible and not uncommon for an earlier version of an analysis script to differ from the final version regarding participant inclusion, even if misconduct did not occur. This is especially true in a complex research setting with recent software transitions and various legitimate procedural influences.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 75"

Here are some factors that could support such a scenario:\n\n1. **Data Fabrication or Selective Reporting**: Intentionally excluding participants whose data do not support the hypothesis could artificially create or strengthen the appearance of statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modifying Outliers or Criteria Post-hoc**: Participants might be excluded because their data were inconsistent with the desired outcomes, especially if inclusion/exclusion criteria were modified post-hoc based on the initial analysis results.\n\n3. **Improving Significance**: Excluding participants to achieve a desired level of statistical significance (like moving from a non-significant to a significant result) might be an indication of misconduct. This includes practices such as p-hacking.\n\n4. **Reviewer Pressure**: Given the pressure from Professor Mills to produce publishable results, Lena might have felt compelled to manipulate the dataset in a manner that presents “clean” and supportive results, particularly if she believed the theory to be true.\n\n5. **Pattern of Exclusion**: If the excluded participants consistently exhibited results that contradicted the main effect or weakened the statistical power of the hypothesis-supporting data, this could strongly suggest intentional misconduct.\n\nIn scenarios of academic misconduct, it is not uncommon for data to be selectively included or excluded to present a stronger narrative in the final analysis than what was evident in preliminary testing.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to integrate all available evidence and factors:\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns in Data**: The presence of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is concerning and often indicative of p-hacking, particularly if no other reasonable explanations exist.\n\n2. **Modifications of Preregistration**: Changing preregistration documents after data collection raises significant red flags, especially if exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are altered in ways that might favor desired results.\n\n3. **Communications and Pressures**: Lena's email statements reflect the significant pressures she faced, which could increase the temptation to ensure results align with expectations, though this alone doesn't prove misconduct.\n\n4. **Past Conduct and Records**: Her history of well-documented, reproducible data and passing an independent audit weighs against a pattern of misconduct, suggesting any unethical behavior is not a longstanding practice.\n\n5. **Lab Environment**: The context of lab-wide practices, such as running multiple analyses, might indicate a culture of thorough exploration, or it could hint at normalized questionable practices under certain pressures.\n\n6. **Technical Issues**: The software switch and hard drive failure provide plausible technical explanations for some irregularities, although they could also offer convenient cover in case of misconduct.\n\nConsidering the entirety of the evidence, while there are multiple concerns indicative of possible misconduct, some factors, like her previous good record and some technical explanations, balance the scales. However, the degree of the red flags present cannot be ignored entirely.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 65"

    "content": "Based on the provided information and the factors considered, it is challenging to conclude with absolute certainty whether Lena committed academic misconduct. There are indicators that raise suspicion, such as the modifications after data collection and the unusual p-value distribution, but there are also mitigating factors like her past record of integrity and technical issues that provide plausible non-nefarious explanations. Given this ambiguous situation and weighing the evidence, I cannot definitively state yes or no. A thorough and impartial investigation would be necessary to reach a definitive conclusion."
