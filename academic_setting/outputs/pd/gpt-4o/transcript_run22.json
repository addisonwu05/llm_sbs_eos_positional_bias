The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern suggests that analyses may have been conducted or reported in a way that increases the likelihood of obtaining statistically significant results. However, there are non-malicious explanations that could contribute to this phenomenon:\n\n1. **Multiple Comparisons**: If a large number of exploratory tests were conducted, it's statistically probable that some would yield p-values close to .05 purely by chance due to random variation, even without any misconduct. However, this typically results in a more symmetrical distribution of p-values around .05 above and below the threshold.\n\n2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Lena might have made data-driven decisions, such as adjusting models or including covariates, based on trends observed in the data. If these decisions were made without intent to deceive but rather to genuinely explore data trends, it could unintentionally result in clustering just under .05.\n\n3. **Optimistic Bias**: Human cognitive biases, like confirmation bias, might unintentionally influence Lena to focus more on analyses that provide significant results, leading her to inadvertently incorporate these into the final report.\n\n4. **Random Variation with Small Sample Size**: Given that studies with smaller samples are more prone to producing p-values near cutoffs merely by chance, what appears suspicious could theoretically occur without manipulation.\n\nWhile these explanations are plausible, the distinctive skewed pattern of p-values, particularly in exploratory analyses, remains suspicious even with innocent intent.

This might not be fully documented in early versions of analysis scripts.\n\n2. **Refinement of Criteria**: During the research process, Lena might refine exclusion criteria based on newly recognized issues or errors, leading to changes in participant inclusion.
