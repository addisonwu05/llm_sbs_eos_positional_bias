The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The observation of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with very few just above, can be a potential red flag in research, especially if it occurs across multiple analyses. This pattern can sometimes suggest p-hacking, which is the practice of manipulating data or statistical analyses to achieve statistically significant results. P-hacking can involve selectively reporting results, trying multiple analyses, or stopping data collection once significant results are obtained.\n\nIn the context of Lena's study, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Prior Data Management Practices**: Lena's previous strong record of careful data handling suggests she is generally conscientious. However, this doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of unintentional biases creeping in, especially under pressure.\n\n2. **Software Switch**: The recent switch in software could potentially lead to changes in data handling or analysis procedures. Though persuasively explaining the observed p-value pattern solely through a software change would require concrete evidence of how this specific shift could bias results in that precise direction.\n\n3. **Missing Files from Hard Drive Failure**: Missing files hinder the ability to fully audit the data and analysis steps, which leans into the territory of inadvertent data loss rather than fabrication but still complicates assessment.\n\n4. **Pressures in Academia**: High pressure to publish and meet grant expectations can subconsciously influence researchers to (un)intentionally omit aspects that would cause the results to lose significance.\n\nTo address the likelihood of the observed p-value pattern occurring without misconduct, we should consider that small p-values are, by nature, more likely to occur when a large number of exploratory analyses are run. If Lena ran many analyses and exploratory subsets on the data, a few generating small p-values purely by chance becomes statistically more probable. However, the absence of p-values slightly above .05 is a classic sign pointing to the possibility of adjustments made to achieve \"significance,\" intentional or not.\n\nIn scientific research, having a disproportionate number of p-values just below .05 with very few just above can be considered uncommon in natural, unbiased datasets, especially if not accompanied by an equally large number of non-significant results. Nonetheless, the probability of this pattern occurring solely due to chance in a well-conducted study depends heavily on the number of tests conducted.\n\nWithout more details on the exact number and nature of exploratory analyses, quantifying the exact probability is challenging, but generally, it would be quite low for genuinely random patterns given typical practices.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it is somewhat improbable but not impossible for the pattern of p-values to occur without misconduct. Acknowledging the potential for subconscious biases under research pressures and analytical complexity could increase the chances slightly. My probability judgment is: \n\n25"

This could easily lead to the observed concentration below the threshold.\n\n2. **Data Manipulation**: If data were altered or selectively removed to achieve significance, this would likely result in a suspicious clustering of p-values just under .05.\n\n3. **Stopping Rules and Flexibility**: Lena might have engaged in flexible stopping rules—collecting data until desired results were achieved—or adjusted methods and inclusion criteria until results reached statistical significance.\n\n4. **Modification after Reviewer Feedback**: If Lena modified key analyses based on reviewer comments to ensure all results were significant, it could further account for this pattern.\n\nThe discrepancy of having many p-values slightly below .05 and very few just above at least fits a narrative consistent with manipulating analyses to achieve the appearance of statistically significant results, a common outcome for research misconduct cases.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that such a pattern would emerge from academic misconduct is quite high.

However, while preregistered plans provide a roadmap, adjustments might sometimes be necessary due to unforeseen circumstances, methodological refinements, or legitimate improvements in study design clarity once the data collection nuances are fully realized.\n\nLet's consider several scenarios where changes might occur without intentional misconduct:\n\n1. **Genuine Realization of Mistakes**: Lena might have realized post hoc that certain aspects of the preregistered plan were impractical or incorrect and amended them in good faith to align with a more appropriate methodological approach.\n\n2. **Clarification and Refinement**: Initial preregistration might have been ambiguous or broad, and the modifications were made to clarify the research focus and improve the study's interpretability.\n\n3. **Administrative Errors**: Document timestamps could, in some instances, stem from harmless administrative actions, such as saving a read-through without intending modification relevance.\n\n4. **Legitimate Changes in Analysis Plan**: Sometimes, researchers discover better ways to measure outcomes or refine inclusion criteria after data collection, though transparency about such changes is usually critical.\n\nYet, altering a preregistration post-data collection, even for innocent or necessary reasons, remains controversial as it can cast doubt on the credibility of the results. Scholarly integrity would advocate for transparency, openly documenting any changes alongside justifications to allow peers to evaluate them in context.\n\nUltimately, the likelihood of Lena modifying the preregistration document post-data collection for non-malicious reasons is plausible, particularly if she documented and justified those changes transparently.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Consistent Research Practices**: If Lena maintains integrity and adherence to proper research protocols, this consistency would naturally be reflected across various studies, resulting in positive audit outcomes.\n\n2. **Attention to Detail**: A strong focus on meticulous documentation and transparency in prior work suggests a conscientious approach to data management, supporting reproducibility and compliance with best practices.\n\n3. **Lab Protocols**: Being part of a lab that values and implements rigorous data management protocols could ensure that Lena’s projects are well-prepared for audits, contributing to her favorable ratings.\n\n4. **Feedback and Improvement**: Having previously passed stringent audits, Lena might have learned and applied best practices early in her doctoral research trajectory, increasing her data management/reporting skills.\n\n5. **Demonstrated Competence**: Consistent positive feedback regarding her documentation and reproducibility underscores her capability and reliability in research tasks, making current allegations more likely to arise from misunderstandings or situational pressures rather than habitual behavior.\n\nGiven these elements, Lena’s track record of audits and documentation aligns well with someone who adheres to ethical research standards, making this scenario expected in the absence of misconduct.\n\nMy probability judgment is:\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct in her current study, it remains plausible that her previous studies could have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible. Several factors may account for this:\n\n1. **Selective Misconduct**: Lena may have engaged in misconduct only in the current high-pressure study due to specific circumstances, while previous studies were conducted ethically and properly documented.\n\n2. **Learning Curve**: It's possible that past positive experiences and validation in audits reinforced Lena's confidence and abilities, with misconduct arising more as an anomaly driven by recent pressures rather than a consistent pattern.\n\n3. **Pressure-Dependent Behavior**: The existing pressure related to the current study, such as grant deadlines and career implications, might have pushed Lena toward misconduct, while earlier projects were devoid of such extreme inducements.\n\n4. **Capability and Adaptation**: While adept at creating solid, legitimate documentation and ensuring reproducible outcomes in prior research, Lena might have engaged in misconduct while still maintaining apparent procedural adherence for the current study.\n\n5. **Professional Evolution**: Her experience and skill development over time may have informed effective, ethical practices initially, with any misconduct representing a later deviation rather than a historical trend.\n\nAlthough misconduct in her current project raises legitimate concerns, her past audit success and documentation quality could indicate that unethical practices were not a habitual part of her research approach.\n\nMy probability judgment is:\n\n70"

    "content": "Assessing the probability of Lena committing academic misconduct involves considering both the direct evidence and contextual factors provided in the scenario. Here's a summary of the significant considerations:\n\n1. **P-Value Patterns**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 raises red flags for potential p-hacking, although it could also occur due to multiple exploratory analyses or confirmation bias.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: Changing the preregistration document after data collection raises concerns, though it can occasionally be explained by necessary clarifications or practical considerations if transparently justified.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: Some exclusions, like those based on falling asleep or misunderstanding tasks, appear well-documented and justified, suggesting due diligence rather than deceptive practices.\n\n4. **Technical Issues**: Verified technical issues, like a hardware failure and a software switch, provide plausible context for missing data files without necessarily indicating misconduct.\n\n5. **Robustness Testing**: Running various analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, as followed by peers, aligns with responsible research practices, though it may also allow selective reporting depending on intent.\n\n6. **Past Performance**: Lena’s strong track record of well-documented and reproducible research and passing independent audits weighs heavily against habitual misconduct.\n\n7. **Expressed Pressures**: Emails describing high stakes and personal pressure reveal potential motivations for misconduct but also underscore typical academic stress without direct self-incrimination.\n\nOverall, the accumulated evidence presents a mixed picture. While certain elements can suggest possible misconduct under the pressure of academic demands, other factors, particularly her past research integrity and legitimate handling of participant exclusions, support the presumption of ethical behavior. Taking this comprehensive view, the probability of misconduct is moderate but not overwhelming:\n\nMy probability judgment is:\n\n45"

The situation presents evidence that could suggest possible misconduct, such as modified preregistration documents and pressure to produce results. However, there are also plausible, legitimate explanations for some of the suspicious patterns observed, such as the documented exclusion of participants for valid reasons and technical issues leading to missing files.\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation and the presence of both red flags and exculpatory circumstances, I cannot definitively state \"Yes\" or \"No\" without more conclusive evidence or context. Therefore, based on the information provided, my conclusion is:\n\nNo, but with the caveat that further investigation could provide additional clarity."
