The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of a coworker seeing Alex standing next to the printer before it stopped working, if Alex did not actually break the printer, we should consider several factors.\n\n1. **Normal Use of Printer:** Alex frequently uses the printer. It's not unusual for employees, especially those who regularly use certain office equipment, to be seen near it as part of their normal workday activities. Simply being seen near the printer isn't inherently suspicious or indicative of wrongdoing.\n   \n2. **Timing and Context:** If Alex was indeed using the printer normally and it failed due to mechanical issues soon after, it would not be surprising for someone to have observed him nearby in the period leading up to the malfunction. The fact that building access logs show Alex leaving before the time recorded for the critical error suggests he may not have been present when the failure occurred.\n\n3. **Other Users:** There's evidence that Jamie was seen tugging on paper earlier. It's possible someone else might have used the printer or it experienced issues independently of Alex's actions. Also, in a busy office, people come and go frequently, so brief intervals without observed traffic or activity are plausible.\n\n4. **Reliability of Observation:** The coworker’s report is based on a single perspective. It's subject to human error, memory limitations, and potential biases, especially considering the informal suspicion already aimed at Alex.\n\nCombining these considerations, the chance of a coworker seeing Alex near the printer shortly before it malfunctioned—without Alex having caused the malfunction—is fairly plausible due to routine usage and potential mechanical defects. \n\nFrom these factors, the likelihood that a coworker would see Alex standing next to the printer five minutes before it stopped working, given that he did not break it, is reasonably high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75"

Being seen in proximity to the printer aligns with this scenario.\n\n2. **Timing of Actions:** If Alex interacted with the printer in a manner that led to its failure, it's likely this happened close in time to the critical hardware error, increasing the odds of someone observing him there just before the malfunction.\n\n3. **Opportunities for Observation:** With a limited time gap between his potential reckless actions and the malfunction, coworkers, especially in an open-plan setting, would have a reasonable chance of spotting him near the printer around that time.\n\n4. **Office Dynamics and Behavior:** Given Alex previously complained about the printer and was observed next to it before it failed, if his actions indeed led to the breakdown, coworkers could reasonably perceive his presence nearby, especially if it aligned with these suspicions.\n\nIn summary, if Alex broke the printer, it's quite likely that a coworker would have seen him near it shortly before the failure since his actions would necessitate such proximity.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"
