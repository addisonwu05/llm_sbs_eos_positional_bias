  "Based on the provided information and considering various factors and possibilities, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The situation presents evidence that could suggest possible misconduct, such as modified preregistration documents and pressure to produce results. However, there are also plausible, legitimate explanations for some of the suspicious patterns observed, such as the documented exclusion of participants for valid reasons and technical issues leading to missing files.\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation and the presence of both red flags and exculpatory circumstances, I cannot definitively state \"Yes\" or \"No\" without more conclusive evidence or context. Therefore, based on the information provided, my conclusion is:\n\nNo, but with the caveat that further investigation could provide additional clarity."
