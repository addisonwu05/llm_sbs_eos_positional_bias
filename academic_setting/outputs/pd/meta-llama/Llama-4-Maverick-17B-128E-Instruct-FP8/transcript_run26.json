The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is intended to be a time-stamped record of the research plan before data collection. However, mistakes can happen, and researchers might realize after data collection that they need to adjust their analysis plan due to unforeseen issues or miscommunication.\n\nOne possible explanation is that Lena or her team realized there was a discrepancy between the preregistration and their actual analysis plan or that there were errors in the preregistration document that needed correction. However, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes without clear justification or documentation of the reason for the change is generally considered bad practice and can raise suspicions.\n\nThat being said, there could be innocent explanations for this, such as miscommunication or a genuine need to adjust the analysis due to unforeseen data issues that were not anticipated during the preregistration process.\n\nGiven the context that Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling and insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, it is plausible that the modification was due to an unintentional error.\n\nThe likelihood of this happening without misconduct depends on how plausible the \"honest mistake\" or \"miscommunication\" explanation is. Without more information on why the document was modified and what the specific changes were, it's difficult to assess the probability.\n\nHowever, given that preregistration is a well-established practice and researchers are generally aware of its importance, making significant changes without clear documentation or justification is unusual.\n\n70"
