The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's reasonable to expect that the initial analysis included a broader dataset, and subsequent exclusions were made based on valid criteria. In research, it's a common practice to have initial datasets that are later refined based on various inclusion and exclusion criteria, which are often decided before analyzing the data or based on the data quality. These criteria could be related to the participants' performance, data quality issues, or other methodological considerations.\n\nThe fact that an earlier version of the analysis script included additional participants who were later excluded could suggest several things:\n1. **Data Cleaning Process**: It's standard practice to clean data before analysis, which involves checking for outliers, errors in data entry, or participants who did not follow instructions properly. Excluding participants based on pre-defined criteria is a part of this process.\n2. **Evolution of Analysis Plan**: Sometimes, as researchers delve deeper into their data or as feedback is received from peers, the analysis plan might evolve. This could involve changing inclusion criteria or deciding to exclude certain participants based on new information or insights.\n\nThe presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants doesn't directly imply misconduct. It could simply indicate that Lena and her team followed a rigorous data analysis process that involved refining their dataset based on certain criteria.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is quite plausible that an earlier analysis included more participants who were later excluded, even if Lena did not commit academic misconduct. This is a normal part of the research process.\n\n85"

This can be a sign of potential issues with the data or analysis, including selective reporting or p-hacking, which is a form of academic misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are still a few reasons why the data might show this pattern:\n1. **Genuine effects**: It's possible that the theory being tested is correct, and the effects are real and strong enough to yield p-values below .05. However, this doesn't directly explain the lack of p-values just above .05 unless the analyses were highly powered.\n2. **Analysis decisions**: Researchers might make decisions about analyses based on a priori hypotheses or methodological considerations that could lead to a concentration of significant results. However, this doesn't typically result in a suspicious distribution around .05.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in genuine, non-manipulated data, one would typically expect a more uniform distribution of p-values across the range, especially for exploratory analyses, unless there's a real effect. The absence of p-values just above .05 is unusual and can raise suspicions.\n\nIn a scenario without misconduct, achieving such a pattern is less likely but not impossible.

Specifically, misconduct could involve tweaking analyses or excluding/including data points to push p-values below the .05 threshold, thereby avoiding the reporting of non-significant results.\n\nIn cases of misconduct, researchers might iteratively adjust their analyses until they achieve significant results, stopping once they cross the .05 threshold.
