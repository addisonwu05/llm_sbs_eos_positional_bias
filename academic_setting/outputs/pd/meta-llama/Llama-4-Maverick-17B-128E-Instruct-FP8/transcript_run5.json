The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To determine the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider what factors could lead to such a distribution of p-values.\n\n1. **Understanding p-values**: p-values represent the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed during the experiment, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A p-value of .05 is a common threshold for determining statistical significance.\n\n2. **Distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis**: Under the null hypothesis, p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means that, theoretically, we should expect an equal number of p-values in any given range of the same size (e.g., 0 to .05, .05 to .10).\n\n3. **Observed distribution**: The observed distribution shows a high concentration of p-values just below .05. This could be due to several factors:\n   - **Selective reporting or p-hacking**: Researchers might manipulate data or analysis choices to achieve a p-value below .05, which is a common threshold for publication. However, this is considered a form of academic misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practice.\n   - **Genuine effects and careful analysis**: If the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., there is a real effect), then we would expect to see more p-values below .05 than above. However, the concentration \"just below\" .05 might still be suspicious.\n\n4. **Assessing likelihood without misconduct**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct (such as p-hacking or data fabrication), there are still reasons why the distribution of p-values might not be uniform, especially if there are real effects being tested. However, a suspicious clustering just below .05 can occur due to various factors, including publication bias or selective reporting at later stages (though this isn't directly Lena's fault if it's due to reviewers' or editors' suggestions).\n\n5. **Statistical considerations**: For genuine effects, the distribution of p-values is not uniform; it tends to be skewed towards lower values. However, the specific clustering just below .05 (without a corresponding number just above) is unusual and can be indicative of manipulation or bias in analysis choices.\n\n6. **Other explanations**: Factors like the lab switching software or file management issues (e.g., hard drive failure) could lead to irregularities but are less directly related to the specific distribution of p-values unless they affected analysis choices or data integrity in a biased way.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it's possible for a dataset to show a concentration of p-values below .05 if there are real effects, the specific pattern of having many p-values \"just below\" .05 and almost none \"just above\" is unusual and typically raises suspicions. However, it's not impossible to occur by chance or due to legitimate analysis practices, especially in a context where there are real effects and multiple exploratory analyses are conducted.\n\nTo quantify this, simulations and studies have shown that for real effects, the distribution of p-values can indeed be skewed towards 0, but a sharp drop-off at .05 is not typical of honest research practices without any form of selection or bias.\n\nTherefore, while there's a rationale for why the observed distribution might occur (e.g., real effects), the sharp clustering just below .05 without many values just above is suspicious and not typical.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This can result in an unusual distribution of p-values, with a higher concentration just below .05.\n\n2. **Data manipulation or fabrication**: If Lena fabricated or significantly manipulated data, she might aim to achieve results that are statistically significant. A straightforward way to do this is to ensure that the analyses yield p-values below .05.\n\n3. **Expected outcome of misconduct**: If Lena engaged in such practices, it is likely that the resulting dataset would show signs of these manipulations, such as an unusual distribution of p-values. Specifically, a high concentration of p-values just below .05, with few just above, is a pattern that has been associated with p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n4. **Likelihood of the observed distribution**: Given that the observed pattern is one that can be associated with misconduct (like p-hacking), if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that the final dataset would exhibit the observed unusual distribution of p-values.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is likely that the final dataset would show the suspicious pattern observed.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

Researchers often refine their datasets by excluding participants based on predefined exclusion criteria, which can include factors like failing to meet inclusion criteria, technical issues during data collection, or not completing the task as instructed.\n\n1. **Common research practices**: It's a common and legitimate practice to exclude participants from analysis based on certain criteria. These criteria are usually defined before data analysis begins but can sometimes be refined or adjusted based on unforeseen issues that arise during data inspection.\n\n2. **Data quality and integrity**: Excluding participants can be necessary for maintaining the quality and integrity of the dataset. For example, if some participants did not follow instructions or if there were technical issues that compromised their data, excluding them is a reasonable step.\n\n3. **Transparency and documentation**: In honest research practices, such exclusions are typically documented and justified. The fact that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants, which were later excluded, could be a sign of careful data curation rather than misconduct, as long as the exclusion criteria are clearly stated and applied uniformly.\n\n4. **Automated backups and version history**: The existence of an earlier version of the analysis script with more participants is not unusual, given that many research environments use version control and automated backups. These tools help track changes and can provide a history of how the analysis evolved.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that an earlier version of the analysis included more participants who were later excluded based on legitimate exclusion criteria.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

However, in cases of misconduct, there's a risk that exclusions are selective, aimed at achieving desired results.\n\n2. **Misconduct and data manipulation**: If Lena manipulated data or results, excluding certain participants could be part of this process if it helped achieve the desired outcome. However, the presence of an earlier script with more participants doesn't directly imply misconduct related to participant exclusion.\n\n3. **Deception and cover-up**: In cases of misconduct, researchers might not document their actions transparently. The existence of an earlier script could be seen as evidence of a process that was not entirely transparent, potentially supporting suspicions of misconduct.\n\n4. **Probability assessment**: The key question is whether the existence of an earlier analysis with more participants is likely if Lena committed misconduct. If Lena was manipulating data, she might still have legitimate or seemingly legitimate reasons for excluding participants. The crucial issue is whether these exclusions were part of a larger pattern of misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it's still plausible that an earlier version of the analysis included more participants.

However, in the context of misconduct, one might argue that someone could use this practice as a way to justify or cover their tracks.\n\n3. **Appearance of legitimacy**: By running and storing multiple scripts, Lena might be attempting to appear as though she is following good research practices, even if her actual analysis choices were influenced by other factors.\n\n4. **Evidence of exploration, not necessarily misconduct**: The logs showing multiple analysis scripts could indicate a genuine exploration of different approaches, consistent with the lab's practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, even if Lena committed academic misconduct, it's still plausible that the lab's data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts, as this aligns with the lab's encouraged practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of evidence and their implications.\n\n1. **Suspicious distribution of p-values**: The distribution of p-values just below .05 is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or other forms of misconduct. However, it's not conclusive evidence.\n\n2. **Modification of preregistration**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is a red flag, as it undermines the integrity of the preregistration process.\n\n3. **Pressure and motivation**: Lena's emails indicate she was under significant pressure to produce results, which could be a motivation for misconduct.\n\n4. **Previous good record**: Lena's previous studies were well-documented and passed an independent audit, suggesting she has a history of good research practices.\n\n5. **Technical issues and data management**: The lab switched software, and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure, which could explain some irregularities.\n\n6. **Legitimate exclusion of participants**: The exclusion of participants based on legitimate reasons and documented before journal submission suggests adherence to good practices.\n\n7. **Exploring robustness**: Running multiple analysis scripts is a legitimate practice encouraged by the lab, indicating a culture of thoroughness.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are some red flags (suspicious p-value distribution, modification of preregistration), there are also indicators of good research practices and legitimate explanations for some irregularities. The presence of both suspicious and benign factors complicates the assessment.\n\nGiven the complexity and the mixed evidence, a moderate probability seems reasonable.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
