The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In research, it is a common and entirely legitimate practice to refine the dataset by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria after initial data inspection. These criteria can be based on various factors such as data quality, participant compliance with the study protocol, or the presence of outliers.\n\nThe process of data analysis often involves preliminary analyses with a broader dataset, followed by refinements based on the research questions, the study's methodology, and the quality of the data collected. Excluding participants can be a valid step if it is done based on pre-defined criteria that are transparently reported, or if it is based on unforeseen issues that arose during the data collection or analysis process.\n\nGiven that the lab recently switched software and some files were missing due to a hard drive failure, these are plausible reasons for revisiting and revising the dataset. Such changes can necessitate adjustments to the analysis plan and the dataset.\n\nTherefore, finding an earlier version of the analysis script that includes more participants than the final version does not necessarily imply misconduct. It is consistent with standard research practices to refine one's dataset and analyses based on preliminary findings and issues encountered during the research process.\n\nThe presence of an earlier analysis with more participants is thus not unusual or suspicious in itself; what matters is the rationale behind the exclusion of those participants. If Lena can provide a valid, transparent reason for the exclusions that is unrelated to manipulating the results to achieve statistical significance or to support the theory being tested, it would be consistent with ethical research practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

Alternatively, she might have made initial errors in fabricating data that were later \"corrected\" in subsequent analyses, resulting in the exclusion of certain participants.\n\nHowever, if Lena committed misconduct, one might expect her to be more careful in covering her tracks or to fabricate a consistent narrative throughout.

However, within a single dataset, the distribution of p-values around .05 should generally be more continuous.\n\nSome researchers might argue that this pattern could be due to various legitimate factors, such as the specifics of the experimental design or the analysis strategy.

This is because one common form of misconduct involves manipulating the data or the analysis to achieve statistically significant results, often defined as p < .05.\n\nP-hacking, for instance, involves trying multiple analyses or data processing steps until one yields a significant p-value. This can result in a cluster of p-values just below .05 because the researcher stops once they achieve significance. Similarly, selectively reporting only the results that are significant while omitting those that are not can also lead to an excess of p-values just below .05.\n\nResearchers engaging in such misconduct might also be less likely to report or include in their final analysis results that are just above .05, as these do not meet the threshold for significance. Over time, this can create a noticeable discontinuity in the distribution of p-values around .05.\n\nThe observed pattern is a common red flag for potential misconduct because it suggests that the results may have been influenced by practices aimed at achieving statistical significance rather than reflecting genuine effects.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that her dataset would exhibit this suspicious pattern.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
