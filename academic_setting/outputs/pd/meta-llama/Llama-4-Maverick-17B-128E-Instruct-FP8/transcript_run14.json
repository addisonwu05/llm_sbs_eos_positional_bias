The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's reasonable to expect that she followed standard research practices. In the course of data analysis, it's common for researchers to refine their datasets by applying exclusion criteria to ensure the quality and relevance of the data. These criteria could be based on various factors such as participant performance, data quality, or other study-specific requirements.\n\nIncluding additional participants in an earlier version of the analysis script who were later excluded from the final dataset is a plausible scenario for several reasons:\n1. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**: Researchers often apply exclusion criteria to ensure that their analyses are based on high-quality, relevant data. For example, participants might be excluded if they failed to meet certain performance thresholds, if their data contained significant missing values, or if they reported not understanding the task.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Quality Control**: The process of data cleaning involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, and outliers. Participants with data that fail certain quality checks might be excluded from the final analysis.\n\n3. **Iterative Analysis and Refining Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: It's a common practice to iteratively refine the analysis plan, including revisiting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, as one becomes more familiar with the data or as new information becomes available.\n\n4. **Pre-registration vs. Post-hoc Decisions**: Even if a study is pre-registered, there can be legitimate reasons for deviating from the initial plan, including adjusting exclusion criteria based on unforeseen issues with the data.\n\nThe fact that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants who were later excluded does not necessarily imply misconduct. It is consistent with standard practices of data cleaning, applying exclusion criteria, and refining the analysis plan.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that an earlier analysis script would include more participants who were later excluded due to legitimate reasons such as those mentioned above.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

In such a case, the existence of an earlier analysis script with more participants who were later excluded could be interpreted in a few ways:\n\n1. **Attempt to Create the Appearance of Legitimate Data Processing**: A researcher committing misconduct might create or manipulate earlier versions of analysis scripts to make it seem like they followed proper procedures, including applying exclusion criteria. However, this would be a sophisticated attempt to deceive, as it would require creating a believable history of data processing.\n\n2. **Fabrication or Falsification Might Not Necessarily Involve Complex Cover-ups**: If Lena fabricated data, she might not have needed to go through the motions of initially including more participants and then excluding them. The act of fabrication or falsification could be more straightforward, potentially bypassing the need for such elaborate steps.\n\n3. **Potential Red Flag**: The existence of an earlier script with more participants could be seen as either a genuine part of the research process or a potential red flag, depending on the context. If Lena was fabricating data, she might still create a plausible narrative around her actions, including reasons for excluding participants.\n\nHowever, if the misconduct involved fabricating or manipulating the data to achieve significant results, the likelihood of having an earlier analysis with more participants is still relatively high because it is a common practice in genuine research. An individual committing misconduct might still follow common practices to some extent to avoid raising suspicion, making the presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants plausible.\n\nGiven these considerations, even if Lena committed academic misconduct, it's still plausible that an earlier version of the analysis included more participants due to the reasons mentioned, and potentially as part of creating a facade of normal research practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

Researchers, especially those in competitive fields or on the job market (like Lena, who is concerned about her postdoc chances), may feel a strong desire to produce results that are publishable in such journals.\n\n2. **Grant Funding and Career Advancement**: The statement that her supervisor is counting on the study to save the grant reflects a realistic scenario where research funding is often contingent on demonstrating productivity and the potential for impactful research. Similarly, a null result could be perceived as a negative outcome, potentially affecting one's career prospects.\n\n3. **Personal and Professional Stakes**: Lena's expression that she \"needs this one to work\" indicates the personal and professional stakes involved.

It involves specifying the research plan, including hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans, before data collection or analysis.\n\n2. **Modifying Preregistration Documents**: While it's not unheard of for preregistration documents to be updated, such updates are generally expected to be minor and not to change the fundamental aspects of the research plan after data collection has begun.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, let's consider the key points from the evidence:\n\n1. **Pressure and Incentives**: Lena expressed pressure to produce significant results due to the importance of the study for her supervisor's grant and her own career prospects. While this pressure is real and significant, it doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\n2. **Modifications to Preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which is a red flag. However, the context (whether it was to manipulate results or for legitimate reasons) is crucial.\n\n3. **Distribution of p-values**: The unusual distribution of p-values (many just below .05, few just above) is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Participants**: The exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes is justifiable and not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\n5. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running and storing multiple analysis scripts is a common practice, especially in a lab culture that encourages exploring robustness.\n\n6. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: These are plausible events that can happen in research and aren't direct indicators of misconduct.\n\n7. **Previous Clean Record**: Lena's previous studies were well-documented, reproducible, and passed an independent audit, suggesting a history of good research practices.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are some red flags (modification of preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution), there are also explanations and evidence that support Lena's integrity (previous clean record, plausible explanations for some findings). The presence of some suspicious indicators doesn't necessarily prove misconduct.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence and considering that some questionable practices can occur without intentional misconduct, a moderate probability seems reasonable.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
