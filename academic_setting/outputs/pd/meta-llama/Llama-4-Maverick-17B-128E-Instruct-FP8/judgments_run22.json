  "Based on the evidence and analysis, I would say: No \n\nThe final probability judgment I provided earlier was 60, indicating a leaning towards but not certainty about misconduct. However, when making a binary judgment, the balance of the considerations and the presence of both supporting and contradicting evidence leads me to err on the side of caution and not conclusively say \"Yes\" to misconduct. The mixed nature of the evidence and the fact that some actions (like running multiple scripts and excluding participants based on pre-existing notes) are consistent with good research practices support this stance."
