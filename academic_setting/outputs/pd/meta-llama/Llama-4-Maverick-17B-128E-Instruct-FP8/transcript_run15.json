When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

However, the fact that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer's paper tray makes it somewhat less likely that they are unrelated.\n\nTo assess the likelihood, we need to consider how plausible it is for such fragments to end up in Alex's trash by chance. Other people use the printer and could potentially have broken something and disposed of it in Alex's trash, though this is less direct. \n\nHowever, the most straightforward alternate explanation is that the fragments were somehow transferred or thrown into Alex's trash can, not necessarily by Alex. \n\nGiven that the printer is shared, and the office layout is open-plan, the presence of similar fragments could be due to various factors, but it is still somewhat improbable that they would end up specifically in Alex's trash if he was not involved.\n\nThe probability that the fragments ended up in Alex's trash by coincidence or circumstance unrelated to Alex breaking the printer is less than likely but not impossible.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"
