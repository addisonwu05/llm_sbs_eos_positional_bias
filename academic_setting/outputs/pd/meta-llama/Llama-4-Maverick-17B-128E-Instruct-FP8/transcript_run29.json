The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is a method used to increase the transparency and credibility of research by specifying the study's methodology, hypotheses, and analysis plan before data collection begins. Changing the exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after seeing the data could be seen as a form of p-hacking or outcome switching, which can inflate the risk of false-positive findings and undermine the validity of the research.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct and was following proper research practices, it would be unexpected for her to modify the preregistration document in such a significant way after data collection. Preregistration is meant to be a binding commitment to a specific analysis plan to prevent post-hoc changes that could be driven by the data.\n\nThere are some benign explanations that could potentially account for such a modification, such as a misunderstanding of the preregistration process or an honest mistake in the timing of the document update. However, these explanations seem unlikely given the specific changes mentioned (altering exclusion criteria and primary outcomes), as these are key aspects of the study design that one would typically finalize before data collection.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of academic misconduct, it is quite unlikely that the preregistration document would be modified in such a significant manner after data had been collected.\n\n90"

This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation, where analyses are selectively reported or adjusted until they yield a statistically significant result, typically defined as p < .05.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still possible, though not expected, to see such a distribution due to the natural variability in data. However, the described pattern is not typical of honest research practices. There could be other explanations, such as an unusual effect size or a peculiar distribution of the data, but these would not typically result in such a stark pattern around the .05 threshold.\n\nThe described distribution of p-values is suspicious and more likely to occur if there was some form of manipulation or selective reporting.

It's possible that Lena initially included all participants in an exploratory analysis and later applied exclusion criteria as planned or preregistered. Researchers often refine their analyses based on legitimate reasons such as data quality issues, participant non-compliance, or technical failures during data collection.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is whether the exclusion of participants was done in a transparent and pre-specified manner.
