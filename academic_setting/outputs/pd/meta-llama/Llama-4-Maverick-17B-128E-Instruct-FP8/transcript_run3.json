The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The phenomenon described here is often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"data manipulation\" when it involves selectively reporting or altering analyses to achieve statistically significant results. However, in this scenario, we're tasked with evaluating the likelihood of observing this pattern without academic misconduct.\n\nIn genuine research data, p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. However, when the alternative hypothesis is true, we expect to see more p-values concentrated below .05. The described pattern, where there's a high concentration of p-values just below .05 and a scarcity just above .05, is suspicious and could be indicative of selective reporting or \"p-hacking.\"\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to this pattern without implying misconduct:\n\n1. **Legitimate Analysis Planning**: If the analyses were planned and executed without knowledge of the results (e.g., preregistered), and the theory is correct, it's plausible to observe significant results. However, the unusual concentration just below .05 might still be unexpected.\n\n2. **Data Distribution and Analysis Choices**: The distribution of p-values can be influenced by the nature of the data and the specific analyses conducted. Certain analysis choices can lead to a non-uniform distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis.\n\n3. **File Drawer Effect or Selective Reporting**: Even without misconduct, researchers might be more likely to report significant findings (those below .05) and less likely to report non-significant ones, potentially due to publication bias or personal bias in interpreting results.\n\nHowever, the very specific pattern of having many p-values just below .05 without many just above it is unusual and could suggest some form of bias or manipulation in the analysis or reporting.\n\nTo evaluate the likelihood of this pattern occurring without misconduct, we need to consider whether there are innocent explanations. For instance, if the analyses were correctly specified and pre-registered, and there's a real effect, we might still expect some concentration of p-values below .05. However, the sharp drop-off just above .05 is unusual and typically not seen in genuine, unmanipulated data.\n\nThe probability that the described pattern occurs by chance, without any form of data manipulation or misconduct, is relatively low because the distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis (when there is a real effect) does not typically show such a sharp boundary at .05.\n\nTo directly assess the likelihood of observing this specific distribution of p-values without misconduct is complex and involves understanding the specifics of the study, the analyses conducted, and the underlying data. However, as a general rule, a suspiciously high number of p-values clustering just below the .05 threshold, with a noticeable absence of values just above it, is not typical of unmanipulated data.\n\nGiven the context and assuming that the study was genuinely investigating a real effect with appropriately conducted analyses, the described pattern is still somewhat improbable without some form of bias or manipulation.\n\nThe likelihood is: 20"

For instance, she might have made an honest mistake in the initial preregistration that needed correction, and this correction was done without being influenced by the data. Alternatively, there could have been a miscommunication or a technical issue that led to the document being updated after data collection.\n\nHowever, modifying the preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, raises red flags. It is not standard practice to alter a preregistered plan after seeing the data, as this can introduce bias and undermine the validity of the findings.\n\nThe likelihood of this happening without misconduct depends on the reasons behind the modification. If it was due to an honest oversight or a genuine need to correct an error that was not influenced by the data, it could be considered less severe. However, the fact that changes were made after data collection suggests that the modifications could have been influenced by the results, which is not in line with the principles of preregistration.\n\nGiven that preregistration is meant to be a pre-data-collection activity, modifying it afterward is already suspicious.
