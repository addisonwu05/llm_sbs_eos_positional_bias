The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is a crucial step in research that involves detailing the study's methodology, hypotheses, and analysis plan before data collection begins. This process is designed to prevent issues like p-hacking and to provide a clear record of the research plan.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes without a valid reason (such as correcting a clerical error or updating based on unforeseen circumstances that are clearly documented and justified) would generally be considered inappropriate. It could suggest that the changes were made to align the preregistration with the actual analysis performed on the collected data, potentially to make the results appear more significant or to fit a particular narrative.\n\nHowever, there could be innocent explanations for modifying a preregistration document after data collection has started or even after it has been completed. For instance, if there was an honest mistake in the initial preregistration that was only noticed after data collection began, or if unforeseen issues arose during data collection that necessitated a change in the analysis plan (e.g., unexpected issues with participant responses or data quality that required adjusting exclusion criteria).\n\nDespite these possibilities, modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change key elements like primary outcomes or exclusion criteria, is generally viewed with skepticism in the absence of a compelling, innocent explanation. It is a deviation from best practices that emphasize transparency and adherence to the pre-specified plan.\n\nGiven that there are plausible, albeit not necessarily convincing, innocent explanations for such an action, and considering that the lab recently switched software and experienced a hard drive failure (which could potentially lead to confusion or the need to revisit and adjust documentation), one might still argue that there could be legitimate reasons for the modification.\n\nHowever, the onus is on Lena to provide a clear, credible explanation for why such changes were necessary and made. If her explanation is deemed plausible and the changes are justified, it could mitigate concerns about misconduct.\n\nThe likelihood that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection without misconduct is difficult to assess without more context, but it is generally considered not to be in line with best practices.\n\n60"

Exclusions can be due to various reasons such as participant dropout, failure to meet inclusion criteria upon closer inspection, technical issues during data collection, or outliers that do not meet certain predefined criteria.\n\nRecovering an earlier version of the analysis script that includes more participants than the final analysis suggests that the data analysis process involved iterative steps, which is standard practice.
