The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 without Lena committing academic misconduct, we need to consider a few key aspects.\n\nFirst, in a genuine dataset where the null hypothesis is false (i.e., there is a real effect), we would expect to see a distribution of p-values that reflects the power of the study to detect the effect, along with the variability inherent in the data. If the study is well-powered, we would expect to see many p-values below .05. However, the distribution of these p-values should be somewhat continuous around the .05 threshold if the analyses were conducted without any manipulation.\n\nSecond, the phenomenon described, where there are many p-values just below .05 and almost none just above, is often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or more broadly, as a sign of \"publication bias\" or \"questionable research practices\" when it involves manipulating data or analyses to achieve significance. However, the question posits that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, so we need to consider if there are innocent explanations for this pattern.\n\nOne possible innocent explanation is that the analyses were genuinely exploratory and that the data simply happened to show significant results in a clustered manner. However, the specific clustering just below .05 is unusual under typical statistical assumptions because p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, and when there's a real effect, the distribution of p-values becomes skewed towards 0, but not necessarily bunched up right below .05.\n\nAnother explanation could be that the researchers, without intending to manipulate the data, might have stopped collecting data or stopped analyzing certain variables once they achieved significant results. However, given that the study involved 80 participants, it's implied that the sample size was predetermined, reducing the likelihood of this explanation.\n\nIf we assume the analyses were predetermined and reported honestly without any form of manipulation, the observed clustering just below .05 could occur by chance, but it is still somewhat unusual.\n\nTo directly assess the likelihood of observing such a pattern without misconduct, simulations and studies on p-value distributions under various conditions can provide insights. Research has shown that in the absence of p-hacking or other forms of bias, the distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., when there is a real effect) tends to be skewed towards lower values but doesn't necessarily cluster right below .05.\n\nGiven these considerations and assuming no misconduct, the likelihood that the final dataset shows this specific pattern is not very high because it suggests a level of precision and clustering that is not typically expected by chance alone in genuine, unmanipulated data.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, such as manipulating data or selectively reporting analyses to achieve statistically significant results, it could directly result in a dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05. This is because manipulating data or analyses can involve tweaking results to be just significant (e.g., .047, .049, .041) while avoiding or not reporting values that are just above the .05 threshold.\n\nMisconduct can take several forms relevant here, including selectively excluding data that results in nonsignificant p-values, continuing to collect data until a significant result is achieved, or outright fabricating data to achieve significant results. All these practices can lead to an unusual clustering of p-values just below the significance threshold.\n\nResearch on the distribution of p-values in published literature has shown that there is often a discontinuity around the .05 threshold, with more p-values just below .05 than just above it. This phenomenon is sometimes attributed to publication bias or p-hacking, both of which can be considered forms of academic misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct by manipulating or fabricating data, or by engaging in p-hacking, it is quite likely that the final dataset would show the described pattern. This is because such misconduct can directly influence the distribution of p-values to cluster around the significance threshold.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

This is done to increase transparency and reduce the potential for researcher degrees of freedom that can lead to false positives or biased results. Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, undermines the purpose of preregistration and can be considered a form of academic misconduct if done to achieve more favorable or significant results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are still plausible innocent explanations for modifying the preregistration document. For example, she might have realized that certain details were not adequately specified or that there were errors or omissions in the initial document. However, making substantive changes such as altering exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection without a compelling, innocent reason (e.g., correcting a clerical error that didn't influence the analysis plan) is highly suspect.\n\nGiven that the changes involve altering exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, which are critical aspects of the analysis plan, it is unlikely that such modifications would be made without any intent to influence the results, unless there was a genuine, previously undocumented reason for the change that was unrelated to the data (e.g., a change in the lab's standard operating procedure that was decided before seeing the data).\n\nHowever, the fact that the modification occurred after data collection increases the suspicion that the changes were data-driven. In the absence of misconduct, one would expect any necessary changes to be documented and justified, with a clear rationale that is unrelated to the results.\n\nTherefore, without additional context or justification for the changes, it is relatively unlikely that the preregistration document would be modified in such a substantive way after data collection if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 10"
