The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection could indicate that the changes were made to align the preregistration with the actual analysis performed on the data, potentially introducing bias or making the results appear more significant than they otherwise would be.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are still plausible explanations for modifying the preregistration document. For instance, she might have genuinely forgotten to update the document before data collection, and the changes made post-data collection were merely to ensure that the preregistration accurately reflected the original plan. Alternatively, there could have been a miscommunication or an honest mistake in documenting the original plan.\n\nHowever, preregistration is a formal process intended to prevent exactly this kind of issue. Researchers are expected to finalize their analysis plan before data collection. Modifying it afterward without a valid reason (like correcting a clerical error that didn't affect the analysis plan) raises suspicions.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it's still possible that the modification occurred due to an honest error or oversight. However, it's not the most likely or ideal scenario under normal research practices.\n\nThe probability that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes without misconduct is relatively low because such actions contradict the principles of preregistration. Nonetheless, it's not impossible due to the potential for honest mistakes.\n\n60"

However, the described pattern is suspicious and not typically expected in honest research, as it suggests a possible manipulation of data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\nWithout misconduct, it's still possible to observe a cluster of p-values below .05 if there are real effects being detected.
