The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The grant review is a critical event for the lab's funding, and the outcome of this study could significantly impact Lena's academic career, particularly her chances at a postdoc.\n\n2. **Content of Emails**: Lena's emails to a friend express her awareness of this pressure. She mentions that her supervisor is counting on the study, implies that a null result would be detrimental to her career advancement, and states that she \"needs this one to work.\" These statements reflect the stress and the stakes involved in the study's success.\n\n3. **Motivation vs. Misconduct**: The emails indicate that Lena is under pressure and is highly invested in the study's success. However, feeling pressure and needing a study to \"work out\" does not directly imply misconduct. Many researchers face similar pressures without resorting to unethical behavior. The emails show Lena's awareness of the stakes, which is a common experience for researchers working on critical projects.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Such Statements Without Misconduct**: It's plausible that a researcher, without any intention of misconduct, would feel the weight of such high-stakes research and express those feelings. The emails reflect a genuine concern for the outcome due to its implications for her career and the lab's funding. Researchers often discuss their stress and the pressures they face, including the importance of their projects.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: Given the context, it's reasonable to believe that Lena, or any researcher in a similar position, might express such sentiments without having committed misconduct. The pressure to publish and the consequences of failure are real and can be significant.\n\nTherefore, considering the information provided and the context of academic research, it's quite plausible that Lena would express these sentiments even if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

Lena's emails reflect an awareness of such pressures.\n\n2. **Awareness of Pressure and Misconduct**: If Lena did commit misconduct, it's reasonable to assume she was aware of the pressure to produce certain results. Her emails to a friend indicate that she is aware of and feels this pressure.\n\n3. **Rationale for Writing Emails**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might still express the pressure she feels because it is a genuine sentiment related to her situation. However, one might argue that someone who commits misconduct might be less likely to put their feelings of pressure into writing to avoid creating evidence that could be used against them.\n\n4. **Behavioral Consistency**: On the other hand, individuals who commit misconduct are not always cautious in their communications. Some might be so focused on achieving their goals or so confident in their actions that they do not consider the potential risks of documenting their pressures or motivations.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The act of writing emails that reflect the pressure to succeed does not directly correlate with or rule out misconduct. If Lena did commit misconduct, it's still plausible she would express her feelings about the pressure she's under, as this is a genuine aspect of her situation.\n\nHowever, one might slightly adjust the likelihood downward compared to the case where she did not commit misconduct, considering that someone engaging in misconduct might be more cautious in their written communications. Nonetheless, the content of the emails reflects a common experience for many researchers, not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, undermines this purpose.\n\n2. **Legitimate Reasons for Modification**: There could be legitimate reasons for modifying a preregistration document, such as correcting errors, clarifying ambiguities, or addressing unforeseen issues that became apparent during data collection or analysis. However, such changes should ideally be transparently documented and justified.\n\n3. **Transparency and Documentation**: If changes are made to the preregistration document after data collection without a clear, valid reason (e.g., correcting an oversight, responding to new information that wasn't available at preregistration), it raises suspicions about the integrity of the research process.\n\n4. **Accidental or Misunderstanding**: If Lena did not commit misconduct, any modifications could be attributed to misunderstandings or unintentional actions. However, changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection is a significant alteration that goes to the heart of the research design and analysis plan.\n\n5. **Likelihood**: Modifying a preregistration document in such a substantial way after data collection, without a very clear and compelling reason (like an error correction), is not typical practice for researchers who are acting with integrity. Researchers who are not engaging in misconduct would generally adhere to their preregistered plans or transparently justify any deviations.\n\nGiven the information and context, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's less likely that she would modify the preregistration document in significant ways after data collection without a compelling, transparent reason.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This could involve changing the document to match the analyses she actually performed, especially if those analyses were determined after seeing the data.\n\n4. **Evidence of Misconduct**: The fact that the preregistration document was modified after data collection is a red flag.

When there is a real effect, p-values tend to be lower, but they still should not cluster unnaturally just below a certain threshold like .05.\n\n2. **Clustering Just Below .05**: The observed clustering of p-values just below .05, with a notable absence of values just above .05, is unusual and suggests a non-random process. This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are tweaked or selected based on whether they yield statistically significant results.\n\n3. **P-hacking vs. Misconduct**: While p-hacking (exploring different analyses until finding one that yields a significant p-value) is considered a questionable research practice and not necessarily misconduct, it still indicates a deviation from transparent and unbiased research practices.\n\n4. **Innocent Explanation**: An innocent explanation for such a distribution could be a very specific and unusual combination of factors in the data or analysis, but this would be rare. Typically, one would expect a more uniform distribution of p-values around .05 if the null hypothesis is false or if there's a real effect being tested with some variability.\n\n5. **Likelihood**: The described distribution is unusual and not typically expected under standard research practices without some form of manipulation or selective reporting.

This is a legitimate and transparent research practice aimed at understanding how different analytical choices affect the results.\n\n2. **Consistency with Good Practice**: Running and documenting multiple analysis scripts is considered a good practice as it allows for the exploration of the robustness of findings. It is part of a transparent and open approach to research.\n\n3. **Similarity to Other Students**: The fact that other students in the lab showed similar patterns in their scripts suggests that this was a common practice within the lab, likely encouraged or tolerated as part of their research culture.\n\n4. **Likelihood**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's highly likely that she would be following the lab's practices and culture. Running multiple analysis scripts as part of exploring robustness is consistent with good research practice and does not in itself indicate misconduct.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The behavior described is consistent with a research environment that values transparency and robustness. The fact that Lena's actions are similar to those of her peers further supports the notion that her behavior was in line with lab norms.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's very likely that the lab's data management logs would show her engaging in practices similar to her peers, as part of a broader lab culture.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the lab's data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria if she did commit academic misconduct, we consider the implications of her actions and the context.\n\n1. **Misconduct and Analysis Practices**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it might involve manipulating analyses to achieve desired outcomes. Running multiple scripts could be part of this process, potentially to identify the analysis that yields the most favorable results.\n\n2. **Plausibility of Multiple Scripts**: Engaging in misconduct doesn't preclude the possibility of running multiple analysis scripts. In fact, someone attempting to manipulate results might explore various analyses to find the one that supports their hypothesis or desired outcome.\n\n3. **Lab Culture and Similarity to Peers**: The fact that other students in the lab also ran multiple scripts as part of exploring robustness suggests that this was a common practice. If Lena committed misconduct, her actions in running multiple scripts could be either a genuine part of this exploratory process or a more targeted effort to manipulate results.\n\n4. **Likelihood**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it's still plausible that the logs would show her running multiple analysis scripts. This could be either as part of a legitimate exploration of robustness or as part of her misconduct. The fact that her actions are similar to those of her peers makes it harder to distinguish between these possibilities based solely on the logs.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The behavior of running multiple scripts is consistent with both good research practice and potential misconduct. The key factor is the intent behind running these scripts.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to synthesize the information provided across the various pieces of evidence.\n\n1. **Pressure and Incentives**: Lena faced significant pressure to produce results that would save the grant and support her postdoc chances. This pressure is a common scenario in academia but can be a motivator for misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which is a red flag. If Lena did not commit misconduct, such modifications are less likely.\n\n3. **Distribution of p-values**: The unusual distribution of p-values, with many just below .05, suggests potential manipulation or p-hacking.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Participants**: The exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes is legitimate and not indicative of misconduct.\n\n5. **Data Management and Analysis Practices**: Running multiple analysis scripts is a common practice in the lab and can be part of exploring robustness. This does not directly indicate misconduct.\n\n6. **Past Record and Lab Practices**: Lena has a good past record, and her previous work was well-documented and reproducible. This suggests that she is capable of good research practices.\n\n7. **Technical Issues**: The lab switched software, and Lena experienced a hard drive failure, which are plausible explanations for some of the issues encountered.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- The red flags include the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the unusual distribution of p-values.\n- The pressure Lena was under and the potential for her to manipulate analyses or data to achieve desired results are concerning.\n- However, Lena's past record and the lab's practices suggest that she is capable of and has a history of good research practices.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, it's challenging to be certain. However, the red flags related to the p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document are significant.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
