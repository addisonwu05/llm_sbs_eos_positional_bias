The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of observing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 in the final dataset without academic misconduct, we need to understand the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis and how they behave when the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means that the probability of observing a p-value in any given range is equal to the length of that range. Thus, the probability of a p-value being between 0 and 0.05 is 0.05, between 0.05 and 0.1 is 0.05, and so on.\n\nWhen the alternative hypothesis is true, p-values tend to be smaller, indicating stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. The distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis is not uniform; it tends to be skewed towards 0.\n\nThe observation of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 is suggestive of a phenomenon known as \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where analyses are manipulated or selectively reported to achieve statistical significance (typically defined as p < .05). However, the question is about the likelihood of this pattern occurring without academic misconduct.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to this pattern without misconduct:\n1. **Genuine Effects and Proper Analysis**: If the alternative hypothesis is true and the analyses were planned a priori, one might expect to see more p-values below .05 than above. However, the concentration just below .05 and the lack of values just above it could be due to chance or other factors.\n\n2. **Data Distribution and Analysis Choices**: The distribution of p-values can be influenced by the distribution of the data and the specific analyses conducted. However, an unusual clustering just below .05 is not typically expected under standard statistical practices without some form of selection or manipulation.\n\n3. **Publication Bias and Reporting**: While not directly applicable here since we're discussing the dataset before publication, the anticipation of publication bias might lead researchers to be more interested in results that are significant.\n\nThe key question is whether the observed distribution could occur by chance. Research has shown that in the absence of p-hacking or other biases, the distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis tends to be more complex and depends on factors like the power of the study and the effect size.\n\nSimulations and theoretical work suggest that without any form of manipulation, one would generally expect a more continuous distribution of p-values around .05 when there is a real effect, rather than a sharp drop-off just above .05.\n\nHowever, assessing the exact probability of observing such a distribution by chance alone is complex and depends on multiple factors, including the true effect sizes, the power of the analyses, and the specific statistical tests used.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it's not impossible to observe a concentration of p-values just below .05 by chance, especially if there are real effects and the study is well-powered, the specific pattern described (a high concentration just below .05 and almost none just above) is unusual and might suggest some form of bias or manipulation.\n\nThe probability that this occurs without any misconduct (such as p-hacking or selective reporting) is difficult to quantify precisely without more details on the analyses and the data. However, it's generally considered low for such a pronounced pattern.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"

This is because such misconduct often involves manipulating the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\np-hacking, for instance, involves trying multiple analyses or data transformations until one yields a statistically significant result (p < .05). This can create an artificial clustering of p-values just below .05. Similarly, selectively reporting results that are significant while omitting those that are not can also lead to this pattern.\n\nData falsification or fabrication directly aimed at achieving significant results would also likely produce a distribution of p-values that is skewed towards being just below .05, as the data or analyses are manipulated to support the desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that the final dataset would exhibit the described pattern of p-values.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80"
