The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The emails convey that Lena is under pressure due to her supervisor's reliance on the study's success for a grant and her own future career prospects, specifically a postdoc. The statement \"I need this one to work\" indicates a strong desire for the study to yield positive results.\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand that feeling pressure to produce certain results is common in academia, especially in high-stakes environments like PhD programs and grant-dependent research labs. The pressure can stem from various sources, including career advancement, lab funding, and the desire to contribute significant findings to one's field.\n\nLena's emails to a friend reflect her awareness of and response to this pressure. The content of the emails doesn't directly imply any misconduct; rather, it suggests that she is aware of the high stakes associated with the study's outcome. Many researchers, even those with impeccable integrity, might express similar sentiments under such circumstances without intending to engage in misconduct.\n\nHowever, the fact that she \"needs this one to work\" could be interpreted in different ways. It could mean she is hopeful for a successful outcome within the bounds of ethical research practices, or it might suggest a more intense personal investment that could potentially lead to cutting corners. The phrase doesn't directly imply misconduct, but it does suggest a strong emotional investment in the study's success.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still plausible that she would express the sentiments found in her emails. Researchers often feel the weight of their project's success or failure, and it's natural to share these feelings with friends. The emails indicate that Lena is aware of the stakes and is under pressure, but they don't directly indicate that she acted improperly.\n\nTherefore, considering the context and the fact that feeling pressure and expressing a desire for a study to yield certain results is not uncommon among researchers, it is reasonably likely that Lena would write such emails even if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
