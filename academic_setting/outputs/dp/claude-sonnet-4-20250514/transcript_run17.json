The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

These are clear, objective reasons for exclusion that any competent researcher would identify and document. Key factors supporting legitimacy:\n\n1. **Standard protocol**: Sleep and comprehension failures are textbook examples of valid exclusion criteria in cognitive studies\n2. **Reasonable rate**: 2 out of 80 participants (2.5%) is a very reasonable exclusion rate - not suspiciously low or high\n3. **Documentation timing**: The notes predating submission is exactly what we'd expect from proper research practice\n4. **Clear criteria**: These aren't subjective judgments but observable behavioral issues that compromise data validity\n5. **Research context**: Memory experiments require participant attention and task comprehension to be meaningful\n\nIf Lena were fabricating data, she would be unlikely to create such mundane, routine exclusions. Fabricated studies more commonly show either no exclusions (appearing \"too clean\") or exclusions that conveniently improve statistical results. These exclusions appear to follow standard research protocols rather than serving any obvious data manipulation purpose.\n\nThe fact that proper documentation exists from before submission, combined with the routine nature of these exclusions, strongly supports legitimate research conduct for this particular aspect of the study.\n\n95"

Sleep and comprehension failures are perfect choices because they're universally accepted exclusion criteria.\n\n2. **Strategic documentation**: If fabricating or manipulating data, creating backdated notes or ensuring some authentic early documentation exists would be a logical step to avoid suspicion. The misconduct could involve manipulating other aspects of the data while maintaining some genuine procedural elements.\n\n3. **Mixed legitimate/illegitimate practices**: Academic misconduct often involves a combination of real data collection with selective manipulation. Lena could have legitimately excluded these two participants while manipulating other aspects of the dataset or analyses.\n\n4. **Establishing credibility**: Having some well-documented, routine exclusions actually helps deflect suspicion from other potentially problematic aspects of the data.\n\n5. **Technical ease**: Creating or backdating simple exclusion notes is relatively straightforward compared to fabricating entire datasets.\n\nThe existence of these properly documented exclusions doesn't preclude misconduct in other areas of the study - in fact, it could be part of a strategy to make the overall research appear more legitimate and carefully conducted.\n\n75"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, I need to assess how likely this specific p-value distribution pattern would be.\n\nSeveral factors make this extremely likely under misconduct:\n\n1. **Classic p-hacking signature**: This distribution is the textbook result of p-hacking - repeatedly manipulating analyses (exclusions, transformations, subgroup analyses) until p-values drop just below the .05 threshold. It's exactly what misconduct produces.\n\n2. **Strategic manipulation goal**: The whole point of data manipulation is typically to achieve statistical significance. Someone engaging in misconduct would specifically target getting p-values below .05, creating exactly this clustering pattern.\n\n3. **Multiple analysis manipulation**: The fact that \"several exploratory analyses\" show this pattern indicates systematic manipulation across multiple tests - precisely what someone engaging in comprehensive data manipulation would do.\n\n4. **Selective reporting evidence**: The absence of p-values just above .05 suggests either selective exclusion of unfavorable results or continued manipulation until all reported analyses achieved significance.\n\n5. **Exploratory analysis vulnerability**: Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to manipulation since there are fewer predetermined constraints, allowing more flexibility to achieve desired results.\n\n6. **Statistical inevitability**: If someone is systematically manipulating data to achieve significance, this exact p-value distribution is the natural mathematical consequence.\n\n7. **Detection literature**: This pattern is so strongly associated with misconduct that it's used as a diagnostic tool in research integrity investigations.\n\nThis distribution is virtually diagnostic of data manipulation.\n\n95"

The preregistration modifications after data collection - this fundamentally undermines the scientific process\n2. The suspicious p-value distribution across multiple analyses - this pattern is virtually diagnostic of data manipulation\n\nWhile the technical issues and past good record provide some mitigation, the statistical evidence and procedural violations represent serious red flags that are very difficult to explain through innocent means. The combination of motive (pressure emails), opportunity (technical disruptions), and statistical signatures of manipulation creates a compelling case for misconduct.\n\nThe post-hoc preregistration changes and suspicious p-value clustering are particularly strong indicators that override the more ambiguous evidence.\n\n78"

While some individual pieces of evidence could have innocent explanations, the combination of post-hoc preregistration modifications and the highly suspicious p-value distribution creates a compelling case for data manipulation that cannot reasonably be explained by legitimate research practices alone."
