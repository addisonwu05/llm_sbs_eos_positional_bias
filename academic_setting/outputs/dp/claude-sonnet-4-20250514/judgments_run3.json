  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe the statistical and procedural irregularities are too severe and numerous to be explained by innocent factors alone.\n\nThe p-value clustering just below .05 with almost no values just above .05 is a classic signature of p-hacking that is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally. Combined with the retroactive modification of the preregistration document after data collection - which fundamentally violates research integrity principles - these represent strong indicators of deliberate misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena's previously strong record creates some uncertainty, and some evidence could have innocent explanations, the pattern of irregularities combined with documented pressure and motive presents a compelling case for misconduct.\n\n**Yes**"
