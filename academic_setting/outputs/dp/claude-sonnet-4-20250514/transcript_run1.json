The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this specific piece of evidence, I need to consider how common it is for researchers to exclude participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions, and whether the documentation pattern described is typical of legitimate research practices.\n\nExcluding participants who fall asleep during cognitive tasks or report not understanding instructions is extremely standard practice in cognitive neuroscience research. These are classic examples of what researchers call \"a priori exclusion criteria\" - predetermined reasons to exclude participants that are established before data analysis begins.\n\nThe fact that these exclusions were documented in notes that predate the journal submission is actually exactly what we would expect to see in properly conducted research. Good research practices require:\n\n1. Real-time documentation of any issues during data collection\n2. Clear notes about why participants are excluded\n3. Making exclusion decisions before analyzing the main results (to avoid bias)\n\nIn a study with 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5%) with such issues is quite reasonable - perhaps even on the low side for typical cognitive experiments. Participants sometimes do fall asleep during boring tasks, and some genuinely struggle to understand instructions despite researchers' best efforts.\n\nThe temporal aspect is also important: if Lena were fabricating this evidence to cover up misconduct, she would have had to create backdated documentation, which would be much more elaborate fraud than simply manipulating data. The fact that these notes predate submission suggests they were created during the normal course of research.\n\nThis pattern of exclusions with proper documentation actually supports the hypothesis that standard research protocols were followed, rather than indicating misconduct.\n\n85"

More commonly, researchers start with legitimate data collection but then manipulate results through selective analysis, changing exclusion criteria post-hoc, or altering specific data points.

The scenario mentions Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review\" - this kind of acute pressure can lead previously honest researchers to compromise their standards.\n\n2. **Escalation over time**: Research misconduct often follows a progression from minor questionable practices to more serious violations. Earlier work might have been conducted honestly before pressures mounted.\n\n3. **Technical competence vs. ethical lapses**: Someone can be genuinely skilled at data management, documentation, and analysis while still succumbing to pressure to manipulate results. The technical skills that produce \"well-documented and reproducible\" work are separate from ethical decision-making under pressure.\n\n4. **Selective misconduct**: The current misconduct might be limited to this specific high-stakes study, while previous lower-pressure projects were conducted honestly.\n\n**Factors working against this:**\n\n1. **Misconduct often involves patterns**: While not universal, research misconduct frequently reflects deeper issues with research integrity that would likely manifest across multiple studies.\n\n2. **Independent audits are thorough**: Passing an independent audit suggests genuine competence and integrity that would be inconsistent with fabrication or falsification.\n\n3. **Cognitive dissonance**: It requires significant compartmentalization to maintain high standards in some work while engaging in misconduct in others.\n\nThe situational pressure described in the scenario makes this a plausible but less likely combination.\n\n35"

Modifying it after data collection defeats this purpose.\n\n2. **Temporal logic**: By definition, \"preregistration\" means registering plans in advance. Changing it after data collection makes it no longer a preregistration.\n\n3. **Transparency standards**: Legitimate modifications to preregistrations should be done through proper amendment processes with clear documentation of what changed and why, not by altering the original document.\n\n**Extremely limited legitimate scenarios:**\n\n1. **Genuine errors discovered**: Might correct obvious typos or clarify ambiguous wording that doesn't change substantive meaning\n2. **Technical implementation issues**: Might need to document unforeseen technical problems that require protocol adjustments\n3. **Regulatory requirements**: Might need updates for ethical or safety reasons\n\n**However, the described changes are problematic:**\n\nChanging \"exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\" after data collection represents substantial modifications to core analytical decisions, not minor clarifications. These are exactly the types of changes that preregistration is designed to prevent.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nWhile minor clarifications might be legitimate, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection violates fundamental principles of preregistration and represents questionable research practices even if not outright fraud.\n\n8"

The clustering of p-values just below .05 across multiple analyses with virtually none above .05 is extremely unlikely to occur naturally in legitimate research. Combined with the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, this creates a pattern that is very difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nWhile Lena has positive factors in her favor (clean prior record, legitimate technical issues, standard lab practices), the core statistical anomalies and preregistration tampering represent fundamental violations of research integrity that are characteristic signatures of deliberate misconduct rather than honest mistakes or questionable but innocent practices."
