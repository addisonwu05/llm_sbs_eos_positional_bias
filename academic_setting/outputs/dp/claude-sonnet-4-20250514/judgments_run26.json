  "No.\n\nThe timing evidence is decisive - Alex badged out at 5:12 pm while the critical error occurred at 5:19 pm, creating a clear 7-minute alibi. Combined with his proactive email warning about the printer needing maintenance (\"before it breaks for real\"), his established pattern of responsible equipment reporting, and the known mechanical defects in this printer model, the evidence strongly supports his innocence. The circumstantial evidence (proximity, plastic fragments, frustration) has reasonable innocent explanations, while Jamie's forceful paper-pulling provides an alternative cause for the failure."
