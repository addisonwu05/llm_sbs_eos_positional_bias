  "No.\n\nThe timeline evidence showing Alex badged out at 5:12 pm while the printer's error log recorded the failure at 5:19 pm creates reasonable doubt about direct causation. Combined with Alex's proactive email warning facilities about the printer's problems three days earlier and his consistent history of responsibly reporting equipment issues, this suggests someone who was trying to prevent equipment failure, not cause it.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and witness testimony are concerning, the documented pattern of this printer model failing due to defective fuser units in other departments, along with Jamie's forceful handling of jammed paper earlier that day, provides plausible alternative explanations for the failure.\n\nThe contradictory evidence creates enough reasonable doubt to conclude Alex likely did not break the printer."
