The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, I need to assess how likely it would be for an earlier analysis script to include participants who were later excluded from the final dataset.\n\nThis would be very likely under honest research practices for several reasons:\n\n1. **Normal research workflow**: It's standard practice to start with a complete dataset and then apply exclusion criteria systematically. Researchers typically begin analyses with all collected data before implementing quality control measures.\n\n2. **Iterative data cleaning**: Honest researchers often discover data quality issues progressively as they examine their dataset more carefully. Problems with specific participants may only become apparent during detailed analysis.\n\n3. **Evolving exclusion criteria**: Legitimate exclusions might be identified through multiple passes of data review - initial obvious cases (like the participants who fell asleep) followed by more subtle issues discovered later.\n\n4. **Standard academic training**: PhD students are taught to document their analysis evolution, often keeping earlier versions that show the progression from raw data to final cleaned dataset.\n\n5. **Backup systems capture workflow**: Automated backups naturally preserve earlier stages of analysis, creating exactly this kind of version history in legitimate research.\n\n6. **Quality control process**: Moving from inclusive to more restrictive datasets reflects good research practice of thoroughly vetting data quality before finalizing analyses.\n\n7. **Transparency and reproducibility**: Maintaining records of how exclusions evolved demonstrates good documentation practices rather than suspicious behavior.\n\n8. **Supervisor feedback**: Exclusions might be added based on supervisor review or methodological considerations that emerge during the analysis process.\n\nThis pattern - starting with more participants and refining to fewer through quality control - represents exactly what we'd expect from careful, methodical research practices.\n\n85"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh factors that support both innocence and misconduct.\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **P-value clustering**: The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none above is a classic statistical signature of data manipulation (15% likely if innocent, 92% likely if misconduct).\n\n2. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious breach of research integrity (20% likely if innocent, 95% likely if misconduct).\n\n3. **Iterative participant exclusions**: The pattern from earlier scripts suggests systematic removal of participants, potentially to optimize results (85% likely if innocent, 90% likely if misconduct).\n\n**Evidence that could support either scenario:**\n\n4. **Multiple analysis scripts**: Common in both legitimate robustness testing and p-hacking (85% vs 78%).\n\n5. **Technical issues**: Software switches and hard drive failures are routine (85% vs 78%).\n\n6. **Pressure emails**: Academic stress is universal regardless of research integrity (88% vs 85%).\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n\n7. **Clean audit history**: Previous excellent record strongly suggests honest practices (92% likely if innocent, 65% likely if misconduct).\n\n8. **Legitimate participant exclusions**: Proper documentation of obvious problems (95% vs 75%).\n\nThe most damning evidence is the combination of the highly suspicious p-value pattern and the post-hoc preregistration modifications. These represent objective, statistical indicators that are extremely difficult to explain through honest research practices. While Lena has a good track record and some evidence has innocent explanations, the statistical signatures of manipulation are compelling.\n\nThe convergence of multiple red flags - particularly the p-value clustering, preregistration tampering, and iterative exclusions - creates a pattern consistent with systematic data manipulation under pressure.\n\n78"
