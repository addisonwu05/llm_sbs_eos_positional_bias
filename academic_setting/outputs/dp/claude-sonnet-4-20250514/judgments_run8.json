  "No\n\nThe timeline evidence is compelling - Alex badged out at 5:12 pm but the critical error wasn't logged until 5:19 pm, seven minutes after he left. Combined with his proactive reporting pattern (warning facilities three days prior that it \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real\"), the printer model's documented history of similar failures in other departments, and the alternative explanation of Jamie's forceful paper handling, the evidence more strongly supports equipment failure rather than Alex breaking it intentionally.\n\nWhile some evidence raises suspicion (plastic fragments, inconsistent statements, proximity to the printer), the overall pattern suggests Alex was dealing with genuinely deteriorating equipment that eventually failed due to mechanical defects, possibly accelerated by Jamie's rough handling."
