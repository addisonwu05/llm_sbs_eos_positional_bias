  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that Lena committed academic misconduct. Two pieces of evidence are particularly decisive:\n\n1. **Preregistration modification after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a fundamental violation of research integrity principles that has virtually no innocent explanation for an experienced PhD student.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of multiple p-values just below .05 with gaps just above .05 is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking/data manipulation that rarely occurs in legitimate research.\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence could have innocent explanations (technical issues, pressure, multiple analysis scripts), the combination - especially the preregistration tampering and p-value patterns - creates a coherent picture of systematic data manipulation that overwhelms the alternative explanations."
