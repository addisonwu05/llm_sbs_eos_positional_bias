The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Mid-project switches, while disruptive, are not unusual in academic settings where funding and institutional policies change.\n\n2. **Hardware failures are routine**: Laptop hard drive failures are common technical events, especially for graduate students who often use older equipment intensively.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, I need to evaluate how likely it would be for the final dataset to show this suspicious p-value pattern.\n\nSeveral factors make this pattern highly probable if misconduct occurred:\n\n1. **Classic p-hacking outcome**: This exact pattern - concentration just below .05 with gaps just above - is the textbook signature of p-hacking and data manipulation. It's precisely what researchers would expect to see when someone manipulates analyses to achieve significance.\n\n2. **Strategic manipulation target**: The .05 threshold is the most common significance criterion, so someone engaging in misconduct would naturally focus efforts on getting results just below this critical value.\n\n3. **Multiple manipulation methods**: Given the other evidence (modified preregistration, selective participant exclusions, multiple analysis scripts), this p-value pattern would be the natural outcome of systematic data manipulation.\n\n4. **Exploratory analysis vulnerability**: Exploratory analyses provide numerous opportunities for manipulation - trying different variables, transformations, exclusions, or model specifications until achieving desired p-values.\n\n5. **Sophisticated approach**: Someone knowledgeable enough to modify preregistrations and use multiple analysis approaches would likely be systematic about optimizing p-values across multiple tests.\n\n6. **Consistent with pressure**: Given the high stakes (\"need this one to work\"), someone committing misconduct would likely persist with manipulations until achieving multiple significant results.\n\n7. **Technical capability**: The evidence suggests Lena had the statistical skills and data access necessary to iteratively adjust analyses to produce this exact pattern.\n\nThis p-value distribution is essentially the expected outcome of successful data manipulation efforts - it represents the \"goal achieved\" state for someone systematically p-hacking.\n\n95"

    "content": "Looking at the totality of evidence, I need to weigh the factors supporting innocence against those suggesting misconduct.\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n- Multiple analysis scripts were part of lab-wide robustness testing (normal practice)\n- Clean prior research record with independent audit approval\n- Technical disruptions (software switch, hard drive failure) were independently verified\n- Standard participant exclusions were properly documented before submission\n- Expressing pressure in private emails is normal graduate student behavior\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n- **Critical**: Preregistration modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - this is a fundamental violation with minimal innocent explanations\n- **Critical**: Unusual p-value distribution clustering just below .05 across multiple analyses with gaps above .05 - this is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking\n- Earlier analysis scripts included more participants who were later excluded\n- High-pressure context with explicit statements about needing results\n\n**Key analysis:**\n\nThe preregistration modification is particularly damning. My assessment showed only 8% probability this would occur innocently versus much higher probability (92%) if misconduct occurred. This represents a clear procedural violation that's difficult to explain away.\n\nThe p-value pattern is equally concerning - showing only 12% probability of occurring in legitimate research but 95% probability if misconduct occurred. This statistical signature is well-established evidence of data manipulation.\n\nWhile some evidence (technical issues, pressure, analysis scripts) could occur in either scenario, the combination of preregistration tampering and suspicious p-value distributions creates a compelling case for misconduct that outweighs the innocent explanations.\n\n78"

    "content": "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that Lena committed academic misconduct. Two pieces of evidence are particularly decisive:\n\n1. **Preregistration modification after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a fundamental violation of research integrity principles that has virtually no innocent explanation for an experienced PhD student.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of multiple p-values just below .05 with gaps just above .05 is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking/data manipulation that rarely occurs in legitimate research.\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence could have innocent explanations (technical issues, pressure, multiple analysis scripts), the combination - especially the preregistration tampering and p-value patterns - creates a coherent picture of systematic data manipulation that overwhelms the alternative explanations."
