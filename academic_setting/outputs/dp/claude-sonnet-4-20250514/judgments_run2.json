  "No.\n\nThe timeline evidence is decisive - Alex badged out at 5:12 pm but the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm, creating a 7-minute gap during which Alex was not in the building. This makes it extremely difficult for Alex to have directly caused the failure.\n\nAdditionally, Alex's pattern of proactively reporting equipment problems (including warning facilities 3 days earlier that the printer might break) is inconsistent with someone who damages office equipment. The combination of timeline evidence, behavioral patterns, alternative explanations (Jamie's forceful handling, known printer defects), and Alex's documented history of responsible equipment reporting creates reasonable doubt about his guilt.\n\nWhile some evidence appears suspicious (plastic fragments, chat message), the physical impossibility created by the access logs is the strongest evidence in the case."
