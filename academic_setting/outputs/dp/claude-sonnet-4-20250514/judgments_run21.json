  "Yes.\n\nThe combination of objective evidence is too compelling to overlook:\n\n1. **Statistical fingerprint of manipulation**: The p-value clustering just below .05 with virtually none just above represents a classic signature of data manipulation that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. **Clear procedural violations**: The file timestamps showing post-hoc modification of preregistration (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection) constitutes a serious breach of research integrity regardless of intent.\n\n3. **Strong motive**: The documented pressure and desperation in her private emails establishes both the psychological state and circumstances that commonly lead to academic misconduct.\n\nWhile her previous good record and the technical difficulties provide some mitigating context, the objective statistical and timestamp evidence creates a pattern that is very difficult to explain through innocent means. The convergence of these multiple red flags - particularly evidence that doesn't rely on subjective interpretation - points toward misconduct occurring under extreme situational pressure."
