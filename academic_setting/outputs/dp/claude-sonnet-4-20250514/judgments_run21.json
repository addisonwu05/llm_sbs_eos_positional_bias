  "No.\n\nThe objective electronic evidence showing Alex badged out at 5:12 pm while the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm creates a strong alibi that's difficult to overcome. Combined with his proactive warning email three days earlier, his established pattern of responsible equipment reporting, and the documented alternative explanation (Jamie's forceful handling of a paper jam in a printer model with known defects), the evidence for innocence outweighs the circumstantial evidence against him.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments and contradictory statements are concerning, they don't definitively overcome the timeline evidence placing Alex outside the building when the failure occurred."
