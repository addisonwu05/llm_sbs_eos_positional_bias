  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence points strongly toward academic misconduct. The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modifications** - Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a fundamental breach of research integrity that honest researchers would virtually never commit.\n\n2. **Classic p-hacking signature** - The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a well-established statistical indicator of data manipulation that rarely occurs naturally.\n\n3. **Strategic participant exclusion** - The pattern of excluding participants between earlier and final analysis versions, combined with the other evidence, suggests systematic result optimization.\n\n4. **Clear motive** - Lena's documented pressure and statements about needing the study to \"work\" establish strong motivation for misconduct.\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence have innocent explanations (technical issues, lab practices), the combination of preregistration manipulation and suspicious p-value distributions represents statistical signatures of misconduct that are extremely unlikely to occur through honest research practices. These core red flags, combined with documented motive and opportunity, create a compelling case for academic misconduct."
