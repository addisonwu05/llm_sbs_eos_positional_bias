  "Looking at all the evidence, the key factors that determine this case are:\n\n**Critical evidence against guilt:**\n- Alex badged out at 5:12 pm, but the printer didn't log its critical failure until 5:19 pm - a 7-minute gap that makes direct causation unlikely\n- His proactive email about grinding noises 3 days earlier shows he was trying to prevent problems, not cause them\n- This exact printer model has failed identically in two other departments without any improper handling, indicating a systematic defect\n- His consistent pattern of responsibly reporting equipment issues\n\n**The plastic fragments are suspicious** but could have alternative explanations (cleanup after someone else's damage, unrelated plastic waste, etc.).\n\n**The timeline inconsistencies** (coworker seeing him by the printer, his changing story about printer use) create some doubt, but the fundamental 7-minute gap between his departure and the system failure remains the strongest evidence.\n\nThe combination of the temporal evidence, the documented defect pattern, and his proactive reporting behavior outweighs the suspicious elements.\n\n**No**"
