  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence of post-data collection modifications to the preregistration document (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) represents clear academic misconduct with objective timestamp evidence. Combined with the highly suspicious p-value distribution pattern across multiple analyses - clustering just below .05 with almost no values just above .05 - these form a compelling case for intentional data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's previous good record and some technical explanations provide mitigating context, the preregistration falsification alone constitutes research misconduct regardless of other factors, and the statistical signature strongly suggests systematic p-hacking or data manipulation."
