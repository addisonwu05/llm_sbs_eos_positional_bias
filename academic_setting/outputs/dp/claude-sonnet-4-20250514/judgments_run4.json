  "Looking at the totality of evidence, I believe Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Physical evidence**: Plastic fragments similar to the broken tray found specifically in Alex's personal trash can - this is very difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\n2. **Deceptive behavior**: His inconsistent statements (initial denial of printer use, then partial admission) suggest attempted concealment.\n\n3. **Proximity and timing**: Being observed near the printer just minutes before failure, with no one else approaching afterward.\n\n4. **Escalating frustration**: His team chat message about \"going to lose it\" demonstrates mounting anger that could lead to destructive behavior.\n\nWhile the alternative explanations (manufacturing defect, Jamie's rough handling) and the timing gap between his departure and the logged error create some reasonable doubt, the combination of physical evidence and suspicious behavior patterns is more consistent with guilt than coincidental innocence.\n\n**Yes**"
