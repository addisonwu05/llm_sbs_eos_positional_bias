  "No.\n\nThe evidence suggests Alex did not break the printer. The key factors supporting this conclusion are:\n\n1. **Strong alternative causation**: The documented history of identical failures in other departments due to a known fuser unit defect provides a compelling mechanical explanation.\n\n2. **Proactive responsibility**: Alex's email three days earlier warning about the grinding noise and predicting potential failure demonstrates genuine concern for preventing equipment problems, not causing them.\n\n3. **Timing contradiction**: The conflict between witness testimony and access logs creates significant doubt about the reliability of the most damaging evidence against Alex.\n\n4. **Established pattern**: Alex's history of promptly reporting equipment problems and cooperating with maintenance is fundamentally inconsistent with destructive behavior.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments and witness observation are concerning, the combination of a known mechanical defect, Alex's proactive warning, and the timing inconsistencies suggest the printer likely failed due to the documented fuser unit problem rather than Alex's actions."
