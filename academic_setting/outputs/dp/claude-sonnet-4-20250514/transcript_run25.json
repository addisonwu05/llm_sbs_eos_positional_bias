The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

While the technical issues and previous good record provide some mitigation, they don't adequately explain these core statistical irregularities.\n\nThe combination of clear motive (pressure), means (sole control of data processing), and statistical signatures (p-hacking pattern, post-hoc preregistration changes) creates a compelling case for misconduct despite some exculpatory evidence.\n\n78"

Combined with the highly suspicious p-value distribution showing clustering just below .05 with almost no values above .05, these create statistical and methodological signatures that are extremely unlikely to occur through honest research practices.\n\nWhile Lena has some mitigating factors (strong previous track record, legitimate technical issues, proper documentation of some procedures), the core statistical evidence points strongly toward systematic manipulation of analyses and documentation to achieve desired results.\n\nThe pattern of evidence - high-pressure context, sole control of data processing, post-hoc preregistration changes, and telltale p-value clustering - represents classic indicators of research misconduct that together overcome the exculpatory evidence.\n\n**Yes**"
