The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the various factors that point toward and away from misconduct.\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious breach of research integrity that honest researchers would be very unlikely to commit (I assessed only 15% likelihood for innocent researchers).\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking, extremely unlikely to occur naturally (I assessed only 5% likelihood for innocent researchers).\n\n3. **Participant exclusions between script versions**: Combined with other evidence, this suggests strategic removal of participants to optimize results.\n\n4. **High-pressure context**: Lena's emails expressing desperate need for positive results establish clear motive for misconduct.\n\n**Evidence that could support innocence:**\n\n1. **Strong previous record**: Her earlier work passed independent audits and was well-documented, though this is somewhat less compelling if she developed misconduct tendencies later.\n\n2. **Legitimate explanations for some issues**: Technical problems (software switch, hard drive failure), lab-wide analysis practices, and standard participant exclusions all have innocent explanations.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence have innocent explanations, the combination is highly problematic. Most importantly, the post-hoc preregistration modifications and the suspicious p-value distribution are both strong statistical signatures of misconduct that rarely occur in honest research. When combined with documented pressure/motive and evidence of strategic participant exclusion, they form a compelling pattern.\n\nThe technical issues and lab practices, while providing some cover, don't explain away the core statistical red flags that are characteristic of research misconduct.\n\n78"

The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modifications** - Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a fundamental breach of research integrity that honest researchers would virtually never commit.\n\n2. **Classic p-hacking signature** - The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a well-established statistical indicator of data manipulation that rarely occurs naturally.\n\n3. **Strategic participant exclusion** - The pattern of excluding participants between earlier and final analysis versions, combined with the other evidence, suggests systematic result optimization.\n\n4. **Clear motive** - Lena's documented pressure and statements about needing the study to \"work\" establish strong motivation for misconduct.\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence have innocent explanations (technical issues, lab practices), the combination of preregistration manipulation and suspicious p-value distributions represents statistical signatures of misconduct that are extremely unlikely to occur through honest research practices. These core red flags, combined with documented motive and opportunity, create a compelling case for academic misconduct."
