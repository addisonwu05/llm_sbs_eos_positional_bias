  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence shows a pattern that is most consistent with academic misconduct. The combination of:\n\n1. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. An unusually suspicious distribution of p-values clustered just below .05 across multiple exploratory analyses\n3. Clear documentation of intense pressure and career desperation\n\nThese three pieces of evidence represent serious departures from research integrity that are very difficult to explain through innocent means. While some aspects of the case (technical issues, prior good record, some legitimate exclusions) support Lena's innocence, the core statistical and procedural violations point strongly toward misconduct.\n\nThe preregistration tampering alone is a fundamental violation of scientific methodology, and when combined with the telltale p-hacking signature in the results, it suggests systematic manipulation rather than honest research practices."
