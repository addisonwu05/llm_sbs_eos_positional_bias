  "No\n\nThe timeline evidence showing Alex badged out at 5:12 PM while the printer failed at 5:19 PM creates a significant gap that undermines direct causation. Combined with his proactive pattern of reporting equipment problems, the known mechanical defects in this printer model, and the existence of alternative explanations (Jamie's forceful handling, inherent fuser unit failure), the evidence for innocence outweighs the evidence for guilt.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments and contradictory statements are concerning, they don't overcome the fundamental timeline problem and the broader pattern of evidence suggesting mechanical failure rather than user damage."
