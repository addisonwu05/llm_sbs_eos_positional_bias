The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Labs frequently:\n- Upgrade to newer versions with better features\n- Switch due to licensing changes or budget constraints\n- Adopt software that other collaborators are using\n- Move to more appropriate tools as project needs become clearer\n- Follow institutional recommendations or requirements\n\nGiven that this is a multi-year PhD project in a cognitive neuroscience lab, a software switch partway through is not unusual at all.\n\n**Laptop hard drive failure:**\nHard drive failures are unfortunately common, especially among graduate students who:\n- Often use older or budget laptops intensively\n- May not have optimal backup practices\n- Work long hours putting stress on their devices\n- Frequently transport laptops between lab, home, and conferences\n\nThe IT department has confirmed that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around the relevant time, providing independent verification that this actually occurred.\n\n**Combined probability:**\nWhile neither event is extremely common on its own, both are well within the range of normal occurrences in academic settings. Software switches happen in many long-term projects, and computer failures affect a significant portion of graduate students during their studies. The timing might seem convenient from a misconduct perspective, but these events have plausible, mundane explanations and some independent verification.\n\nThe fact that these issues create gaps in the data trail doesn't necessarily indicate they were fabricated as cover stories - they represent the kind of real logistical challenges that graduate students routinely face.\n\n75"

While Lena could potentially damage her own laptop to create missing files, the IT department has confirmed they repaired a hardware failure around that time. This independent verification makes it much less likely to be fabricated. IT departments keep records of service requests, and falsifying this would require either:\n- Genuine hardware failure (coincidental)\n- Convincing IT staff to lie (highly unlikely)\n- Lena actually damaging her laptop intentionally (possible but risky)\n\nEven if Lena committed misconduct, these technical issues would most likely be genuine coincidences rather than fabricated cover stories, given the independent verification and the difficulty of orchestrating such explanations convincingly.\n\n70"

These represent objective, technical evidence that's very difficult to explain through innocent means. While individual pieces of evidence might have benign explanations, the combination creates a concerning pattern.\n\nThe prior clean record is important but doesn't preclude misconduct under extreme pressure. Many misconduct cases involve researchers with previously good records who make poor decisions when facing career-critical situations.\n\nThe statistical evidence (p-value clustering) combined with procedural violations (preregistration modifications) form a coherent picture of systematic manipulation rather than isolated mistakes or coincidences.\n\n75"
