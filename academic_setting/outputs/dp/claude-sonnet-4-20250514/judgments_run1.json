  "No.\n\nThe timing evidence provides a strong alibi - Alex badged out at 5:12 pm but the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after he left the building. This makes it very difficult for Alex to have directly caused the failure.\n\nAdditionally, Alex's proactive email three days earlier warning that the printer \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real\" demonstrates a preventive, responsible mindset that strongly contradicts breaking equipment. Combined with his established pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems, this suggests someone who cares about maintaining shared resources.\n\nThe printer model's documented history of similar failures in other departments without improper handling provides a plausible alternative explanation, especially given Jamie's earlier forceful handling of jammed paper.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and his inconsistent statements are suspicious, they don't overcome the fundamental timing problem and the strong character evidence suggesting he was trying to prevent exactly this type of breakdown."
