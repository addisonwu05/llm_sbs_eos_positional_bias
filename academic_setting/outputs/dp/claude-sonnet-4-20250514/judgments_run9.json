  "Based on my analysis of the evidence, I believe the combination of factors - particularly the modified preregistration after data collection, the highly suspicious p-value distribution clustering just below .05, and the clear pressure and motivation Lena expressed - creates a compelling case for academic misconduct.\n\nWhile some individual pieces of evidence could have innocent explanations, the overall pattern suggests systematic results-driven manipulation rather than honest research practices. The preregistration modifications and statistical signatures are especially difficult to explain through legitimate means.\n\n**Yes**"
