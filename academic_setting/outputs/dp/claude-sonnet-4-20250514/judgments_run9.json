  "Yes.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors (Alex's history of responsible reporting, the documented mechanical defects with this printer model, and Jamie's earlier forceful handling), the combination of evidence pointing to Alex's guilt is too strong to ignore:\n\n- The plastic fragments similar to the broken tray found specifically in Alex's personal trash can\n- Being witnessed as the last person at the printer with exclusive access during the critical timeframe  \n- The inconsistent statements (denial followed by uncertain partial admission)\n- The escalating documented frustration culminating in \"I'm going to lose it\"\n- The tight timeline between his presence at the printer and the failure\n\nThe plastic fragments in particular are very difficult to explain through coincidence or alternative scenarios. Combined with the other circumstantial evidence, this creates a compelling case that Alex broke the printer, likely through rough handling driven by his mounting frustration with the ongoing mechanical problems."
