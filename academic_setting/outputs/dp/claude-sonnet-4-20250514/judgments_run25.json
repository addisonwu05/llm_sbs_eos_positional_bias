  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe Alex most likely broke the printer.\n\nThe combination of physical evidence (plastic fragments in his trash matching the broken tray), eyewitness testimony (being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching), and his deceptive behavior when questioned (initial denial followed by vague corrections) creates a compelling case for his responsibility.\n\nWhile there are alternative explanations (mechanical defects, Jamie's earlier rough handling) and some evidence supporting his innocence (proactive reporting history, timing discrepancy), the physical evidence is particularly difficult to explain away if he didn't break it.\n\n**Yes**"
