  "No.\n\nWhile there is concerning circumstantial evidence (particularly the plastic fragments in Alex's trash), the totality of evidence points more toward innocence:\n\n1. Alex's established pattern of responsible equipment reporting and proactive maintenance requests is strongly inconsistent with sabotage behavior\n2. The printer had documented defective fuser units with identical failures in other departments without user damage\n3. Alex specifically warned facilities 3 days prior that the printer might break, showing genuine concern for preventing failure\n4. Jamie's forceful handling provided a reasonable alternative cause\n5. Alex's initial memory lapse about printer usage, while suspicious, can be explained by routine workplace behavior and stress\n\nThe physical evidence is troubling, but when weighed against Alex's consistent pattern of responsible behavior and the printer's known defects, the evidence falls short of establishing that Alex intentionally or recklessly broke the printer."
