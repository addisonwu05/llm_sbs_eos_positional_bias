  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe the answer is **No** - Alex did not break the printer.\n\nThe key factors that lead me to this conclusion are:\n\n1. **Timeline contradiction**: The building access logs showing Alex badged out at 5:12 pm versus the printer failing at 5:19 pm creates a significant alibi, despite the conflicting witness account.\n\n2. **Character evidence**: Alex's proactive email warning about the grinding noise three days earlier and his consistent history of responsibly reporting equipment problems strongly indicates someone who cares about maintaining office equipment, not destroying it.\n\n3. **Known mechanical defect**: The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments without evidence of improper handling, suggesting an inherent fuser unit problem.\n\n4. **Alternative explanations**: Jamie's documented forceful handling of jammed paper earlier that day provides a plausible alternative cause for the failure.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and his inconsistent statements about printer usage are concerning, I believe these are outweighed by the stronger evidence supporting his innocence, particularly the timeline issues and his established pattern of responsible behavior with office equipment.\n\n**No**"
