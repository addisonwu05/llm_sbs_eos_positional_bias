  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that Lena committed academic misconduct. The combination of modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, along with the highly suspicious p-value distribution clustering just below .05, represents classic signatures of research fraud that have extremely low probability of occurring through honest research practices.\n\nWhile some evidence could be explained innocently (technical issues, lab procedures, expressing normal academic pressures), the core statistical and methodological red flags point clearly toward intentional manipulation of results rather than honest mistakes or coincidental problems."
