  "No\n\nBased on the evidence, I do not think Alex broke the printer. The key factors that lead to this conclusion are:\n\n1. **Timing**: Alex left the building 7 minutes before the critical error was logged, creating a significant gap that suggests the failure occurred after his departure.\n\n2. **Proactive behavior**: Alex's email warning facilities about the grinding noise and his consistent history of reporting equipment problems demonstrates someone trying to prevent failures, not cause them.\n\n3. **Alternative explanation**: The printer model has documented defects (fuser unit issues) and has failed similarly in other departments without user mishandling.\n\n4. **Jamie's interaction**: Security footage shows another person forcefully handling the printer earlier, providing a plausible alternative cause.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and the eyewitness testimony are concerning, they can be explained by Alex cleaning up debris from the printer's deteriorating condition or Jamie's earlier rough handling. The evidence collectively suggests Alex was dealing with a printer that was already failing due to mechanical defects, rather than being the cause of its breakdown."
