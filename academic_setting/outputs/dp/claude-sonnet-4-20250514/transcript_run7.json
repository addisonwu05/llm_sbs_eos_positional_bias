    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the factors supporting and contradicting misconduct.\n\n**Strong evidence supporting misconduct:**\n\n**Post-hoc preregistration modification (97% likely if misconduct)**: This is perhaps the most damning evidence. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a clear violation of research integrity principles and directly enables results manipulation.\n\n**Suspicious p-value clustering (95% likely if misconduct)**: The concentration of p-values just below .05 with few above .05 is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or data manipulation across multiple analyses.\n\n**Participant exclusions between versions (85% likely if misconduct)**: Combined with the other evidence, the removal of participants from earlier to final analysis scripts suggests strategic exclusion to improve results.\n\n**Pressure documentation (92% likely if misconduct)**: The emails explicitly documenting career pressure and need for results to \"work\" establish clear motive for misconduct.\n\n**Evidence contradicting misconduct:**\n\n**Previous clean audit record (35% likely if misconduct)**: Her strong track record of well-documented, reproducible research creates significant contradiction with misconduct allegations.\n\n**Standard lab practices**: Multiple analysis scripts and legitimate participant exclusions (sleep, confusion) could reflect normal research procedures.\n\n**Technical explanations**: Software changes and hardware failures provide alternative explanations for some irregularities.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\nThe preregistration modification and p-value clustering are particularly compelling evidence of misconduct. These patterns are difficult to explain through innocent means and represent textbook examples of research manipulation. While her previous good record is notable, the documented pressure and results-oriented mindset, combined with the statistical anomalies and post-hoc protocol changes, paint a concerning picture.\n\nThe technical disruptions and lab practices provide some cover, but they don't adequately explain the most problematic evidence, particularly the systematic nature of the statistical patterns and protocol modifications.\n\n78"

The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modification**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a fundamental violation of research integrity that directly enables manipulation.\n\n2. **Statistical red flags**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 across multiple analyses is a classic signature of p-hacking that's extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Systematic pattern**: The combination of participant exclusions between analysis versions, suspicious statistical patterns, and protocol modifications suggests coordinated manipulation rather than isolated issues.\n\nWhile her previous clean audit record creates some doubt, and technical disruptions provide partial explanations for some irregularities, they cannot adequately account for the most damaging evidence. The documented pressure and results-oriented mindset provide clear motive, and the statistical and procedural anomalies form a coherent pattern consistent with systematic data manipulation.\n\nThe technical explanations (software changes, hardware failure) and standard lab practices explain some peripheral issues but don't address the core problems of post-hoc protocol changes and statistical manipulation patterns."
