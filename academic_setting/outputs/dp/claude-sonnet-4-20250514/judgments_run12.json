  "No\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, I believe Alex did not break the printer. The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. His proactive email warning facilities about potential failure 3 days earlier demonstrates genuine concern for equipment maintenance, not destructive intent\n2. The printer model has documented defects causing identical failures in other departments without mishandling\n3. The 7-minute gap between his departure and the logged error suggests mechanical failure rather than immediate damage from rough handling\n4. His established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems is inconsistent with destructive behavior\n\nWhile some evidence appears incriminating (plastic fragments, witness sighting, inconsistent statements), these can be explained by coincidence, memory issues under stress, and normal interactions with a malfunctioning printer that was already deteriorating due to known mechanical defects."
