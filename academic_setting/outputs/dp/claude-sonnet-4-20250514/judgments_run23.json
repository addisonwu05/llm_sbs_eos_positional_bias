  "No.\n\nThe seven-minute gap between Alex leaving the building and the printer's critical error is crucial evidence that undermines his direct responsibility. Combined with the documented history of this printer model failing due to defective fuser units in other departments, there are strong alternative explanations for the breakdown.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in his trash and witness sighting near the printer are concerning, Alex's proactive pattern of reporting equipment problems (including warning about this specific printer three days earlier) suggests someone who tries to prevent equipment failure rather than cause it.\n\nThe timing evidence creates reasonable doubt about Alex's direct culpability for breaking the printer."
