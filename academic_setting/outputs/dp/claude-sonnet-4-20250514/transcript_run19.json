The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Similarly, some participants genuinely struggle to understand instructions despite researchers' best efforts.\n\n2. **Standard exclusion practices**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or don't understand the task is not only acceptable but considered good research practice. These exclusions are based on clear, objective criteria that protect data quality.\n\n3. **Documentation timing**: Responsible researchers typically document such issues immediately when they occur or are reported, rather than retrospectively. This is both for good record-keeping and because these details are fresh in memory.\n\n4. **Prevalence rates**: In studies with 80 participants, having 2-3 participants with such issues (2.5-3.75%) falls well within the normal range of exclusions for attention/comprehension problems in cognitive research.\n\n5. **Preemptive documentation**: The fact that these exclusions were documented before journal submission actually supports legitimate research practices, as it shows the decisions weren't made in response to statistical outcomes or reviewer feedback.\n\nThis evidence is quite consistent with normal, honest research conduct. Such participant issues occur regularly in cognitive studies, and documenting them contemporaneously is standard practice.\n\n85"

Academic misconduct doesn't necessarily mean every single aspect of the study was fabricated.\n\n2. **Maintaining plausibility**: A researcher engaging in misconduct would likely want to maintain the appearance of normal research practices. Including some legitimate, well-documented exclusions actually helps create a veneer of proper methodology.\n\n3. **Real participant issues**: Even if Lena later manipulated data, she could have genuinely encountered these participant problems during actual data collection. The exclusions could be real while other aspects of the data were altered.\n\n4. **Strategic documentation**: Someone committing misconduct might deliberately document obvious, defensible exclusions to demonstrate \"proper\" record-keeping, making any later questionable decisions seem more credible.\n\n5. **Timeline considerations**: The misconduct might have occurred later in the process (e.g., during analysis, response to reviews) while initial data collection and obvious exclusions were handled appropriately.\n\n6. **Cover behavior**: Maintaining some legitimate practices helps deflect suspicion and provides examples of \"proper\" methodology if questioned.\n\nThe existence of these documented, pre-submission exclusions is quite compatible with academic misconduct occurring in other aspects of the study.\n\n75"

Previous work could have been completely legitimate.\n\n2. **Situational factors**: The current study involves unique pressures that weren't present before - Professor Mills being under pressure, the high-stakes nature of the grant review, and the \"high-profile\" nature of this particular experiment.\n\n3. **Escalating pressure**: PhD students often face increasing pressure as they progress. Third-year students may feel more pressure to produce significant results than they did in earlier, lower-stakes projects.\n\n4. **Audit timing**: The audit was conducted \"the year before,\" meaning there's a temporal gap during which circumstances could have changed significantly.\n\n5. **Independent verification strength**: However, independent audits are thorough and would have caught systematic problems with data handling.

Having many scripts makes it harder to identify specific manipulations.\n\n2. **Mixed legitimate/illegitimate work**: Lena could have genuinely participated in the lab-wide robustness initiative while separately engaging in misconduct.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, this pattern of p-values would be extremely likely and represents a classic signature of data manipulation.\n\nHere's why this distribution is highly consistent with misconduct:\n\n1. **P-hacking evidence**: This exact pattern is the textbook result of p-hacking - repeatedly adjusting analyses, exclusions, or variables until results just cross the significance threshold. The concentration at .047, .049, .041 suggests stopping once significance is achieved.\n\n2. **Selective reporting**: A researcher engaging in misconduct would naturally suppress or modify analyses that yielded p-values just above .05, explaining the absence of values like .051, .053, .058.\n\n3. **Strategic manipulation**: The pattern suggests systematic efforts to push marginally non-significant results across the .05 threshold through various analytical adjustments or data modifications.\n\n4. **Publication pressure response**: Given the documented pressure (\"need this one to work\"), someone engaging in misconduct would be highly motivated to ensure all reported analyses appear significant.\n\n5. **Multiple analysis manipulation**: The fact that \"several exploratory analyses\" show this pattern indicates systematic rather than isolated manipulation across the study.\n\n6. **Known misconduct signature**: Research integrity literature extensively documents this exact p-value distribution as one of the strongest statistical indicators of research misconduct.\n\n7. **Boundary gaming**: The sharp cutoff at .05 with clustering just below demonstrates decision-making based on statistical significance rather than natural data variation.\n\nThis pattern would be almost inevitable if systematic data manipulation occurred to achieve publishable results.\n\n95"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the factors that support misconduct against those that support legitimate research.\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n- Post-hoc modification of preregistration after data collection (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) - this is a clear violation of research integrity principles\n- Suspicious p-value distribution with concentration just below .05 and absence of values above .05 - a classic statistical signature of p-hacking/manipulation\n- High-pressure environment with documented motivation for results (\"need this one to work,\" grant and career pressures)\n\n**Evidence supporting legitimate research:**\n- Strong prior track record with independent audit rating work as \"well-documented and reproducible\"\n- Reasonable participant exclusions with contemporaneous documentation\n- Lab-wide robustness testing practices with proper documentation\n- Confirmed technical issues (software switch, hardware failure) that could explain some irregularities\n\n**Critical analysis:**\nThe combination of post-hoc preregistration modification AND the suspicious p-value clustering is particularly damning. While individual pieces of evidence like pressure, technical issues, or even some analytical flexibility could have innocent explanations, these two factors together represent clear methodological violations that are difficult to explain through honest mistakes.\n\nThe preregistration modification especially undermines the legitimacy of the entire analytical approach, and when combined with the telltale p-value pattern, suggests systematic manipulation rather than isolated errors.\n\nWhile Lena's prior good record is notable, the specific evidence of improper practices in this study is quite strong and objective.\n\n78"
