The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is one of the strongest statistical indicators of data manipulation.\n\n2. **Post-data preregistration modifications**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a clear violation of research integrity principles (88% likely if misconduct, only 5% likely if innocent).\n\n**Evidence moderately suggesting misconduct:**\n\n3. **High-pressure context**: The emails about needing the study to work establish classic precursors to misconduct, though these feelings are also normal in academia.\n\n**Evidence that could support either scenario:**\n\n4. **Technical issues**: Software switches and hard drive failures are plausible explanations but also convenient for hiding evidence.\n\n5. **Multiple analysis scripts**: Could represent legitimate robustness testing or sophisticated cover for selective reporting.\n\n6. **Progressive participant exclusions**: Normal research workflow, but also enables strategic data manipulation.\n\n**Evidence favoring innocence:**\n\n7. **Strong prior track record**: Previous studies passed independent audits and were well-documented (85% likely if innocent, 30% likely if guilty).\n\n8. **Legitimate participant exclusions**: Standard exclusions with proper documentation predating submission.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe p-value distribution and preregistration modifications are particularly damning pieces of evidence that are extremely difficult to explain through innocent means. While Lena's prior track record suggests integrity, the statistical patterns and procedural violations represent compelling evidence of misconduct that outweighs the mitigating factors.\n\nThe combination of multiple red flags - especially the near-impossible p-value distribution pattern and clear preregistration tampering - creates a strong case for misconduct despite some legitimate explanations for individual pieces of evidence.\n\n78"
