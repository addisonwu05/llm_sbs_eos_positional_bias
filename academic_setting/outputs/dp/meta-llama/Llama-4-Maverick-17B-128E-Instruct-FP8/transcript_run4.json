When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

It suggests that Alex was attentive to the condition of the office equipment and was willing to report potential issues before they became major problems.\n\nSecondly, Alex's history of promptly reporting broken office equipment and cooperating with maintenance further reinforces the notion that Alex is diligent and responsible in their handling of office equipment. This behavior is consistent with someone who is not prone to causing damage or neglecting equipment.\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, it is reasonable to expect that Alex would continue to exhibit the same behavior patterns that were observed before the breakdown. This includes reporting any unusual noises or malfunctions and cooperating with maintenance requests.\n\nTherefore, if Alex did not break the printer, it is likely that Alex would still have emailed facilities about the grinding noise and continued to demonstrate a pattern of promptly reporting issues with office equipment. This behavior is consistent with Alex being a responsible employee who looks after office equipment.\n\nThe fact that Alex reported the grinding noise and had a history of responsible behavior regarding office equipment actually supports the notion that Alex was not responsible for the breakdown, as it is consistent with Alex's established pattern of behavior.\n\nThe likelihood that Alex would have emailed facilities and had a prior pattern of reporting broken equipment if he did not break the printer is quite high because it aligns with the behavior expected from someone who is responsible and not prone to causing damage.\n\n90"

It's possible for someone to generally be diligent about reporting issues but still be responsible for a particular incident.\n\nHowever, one might argue that if Alex was going to break the printer, they might be less likely to draw attention to it beforehand by reporting the grinding noise. On the other hand, doing so could be a clever tactic to appear innocent or diligent.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's not implausible that Alex could have still emailed about the grinding noise and had a history of reporting issues even if they were responsible for the breakdown. The actions are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe likelihood is not extremely low because the behaviors (reporting issues and potentially causing the breakdown) are not directly contradictory.
