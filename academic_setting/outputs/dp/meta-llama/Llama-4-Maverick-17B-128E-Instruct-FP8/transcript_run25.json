When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This is consistent with the pattern of behavior described in previous incidents where Alex promptly reported broken office equipment and cooperated with maintenance. \n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, it is plausible that his behavior of reporting the grinding noise and his history of reporting equipment issues are genuine expressions of his responsible attitude towards office equipment. The fact that he reported the issue before it became critical suggests he was not trying to hide a problem he might have caused. Instead, it indicates a preventive or at least an informative approach to potential issues.\n\nGiven this context, if Alex did not break the printer, it is reasonable to expect that he would continue to behave in a manner consistent with his past behavior, which includes reporting potential issues with office equipment. Therefore, it is likely that he would have emailed facilities about the grinding noise and continued to show a pattern of reporting broken equipment.\n\nThus, considering Alex's past behavior and the context provided, it is quite plausible (or likely) that if he did not break the printer, he would still have emailed about the grinding noise and have a history of reporting equipment problems.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
