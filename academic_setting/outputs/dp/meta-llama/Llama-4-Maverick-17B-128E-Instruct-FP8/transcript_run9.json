Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This action could have damaged the printer, particularly if Jamie pulled hard enough on the jammed paper.\n\nGiven that Alex did not break the printer, the likelihood of observing Jamie pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper depends on whether this action is a plausible cause of the printer's failure and whether it is coincidental or related. Since the printer model has a known issue with failing due to a defective fuser unit, it's possible that the failure could have occurred due to this defect. However, Jamie's action provides an alternative explanation.\n\nThe fact that Jamie is seen on camera engaging in behavior that could potentially damage the printer makes it more plausible that the footage exists because Jamie's actions were related to the printer's failure.\n\nTherefore, if Alex did not break the printer, it is somewhat likely to moderately likely that the security camera footage would show Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, as this provides an alternative plausible explanation for the printer's failure.\n\n70"
