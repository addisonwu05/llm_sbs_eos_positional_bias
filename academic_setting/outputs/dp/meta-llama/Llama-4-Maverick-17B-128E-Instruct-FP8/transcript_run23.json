    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the lab switched software during the project and that Lena's laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the plausibility of these events occurring independently of any misconduct.\n\n1. **Lab Switching Software**: It's not uncommon for labs to switch or upgrade their software tools for various reasons such as improved functionality, better compatibility with new data formats, or enhanced analytical capabilities. Labs often adopt new software to stay current with the latest methodologies or to comply with new requirements from funding agencies or journals. The switch could also be due to changes in personnel or collaboration with other labs that use different software. Therefore, switching software halfway through a project is plausible and can happen for reasons unrelated to misconduct.\n\n2. **Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: Hardware failures, including hard drive failures, are not rare. Laptops are subject to wear and tear, and components like hard drives can fail due to mechanical stress, manufacturing defects, or age. The fact that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure and repaired it lends credibility to the occurrence of a genuine technical issue. Hard drive failures can result in data loss or corruption, especially if backups are not regularly performed or are incomplete.\n\nThe coincidence of these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) might seem suspicious, but they can occur independently. The switch in software could be a planned decision made by the lab for valid reasons, and the hard drive failure is a type of event that can happen to anyone, regardless of their data handling practices.\n\nGiven that both events are plausible and can occur for reasons unrelated to academic misconduct, it is reasonable to consider that they could happen to Lena's lab and laptop without any wrongdoing on her part.\n\nThe probability that these events occur without Lena committing academic misconduct is relatively high because both are relatively common occurrences in a research setting. The software switch is a decision that could be made for a variety of legitimate reasons, and hardware failures are an unfortunate but not uncommon reality.\n\nTherefore, considering the given context and the explanations for the events, the likelihood that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena's laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure without any academic misconduct is quite plausible.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the lab switched software during the project and that Lena's laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure if Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to consider whether committing misconduct would influence the probability of these events.\n\n1. **Lab Switching Software**: The decision to switch software is typically made at a lab or team level and is not directly related to an individual's actions or misconduct. Even if Lena committed academic misconduct, this would not directly influence the lab's decision to switch software. The lab might still decide to switch software for valid reasons such as those mentioned earlier (better functionality, compatibility, etc.). Therefore, the likelihood of the lab switching software remains relatively unaffected by Lena's potential misconduct.\n\n2. **Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure is a hardware issue that can occur regardless of a person's behavior or actions related to academic misconduct. While it's theoretically possible that someone could intentionally damage their laptop, the fact that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure suggests that the failure was genuine. If Lena committed misconduct, it's less likely that she would intentionally cause a hard drive failure that could raise suspicions, unless she was trying to cover her tracks by destroying evidence. However, the scenario described involves a reported and repaired hardware failure, which doesn't directly imply an intentional act by Lena to destroy data.\n\nGiven that both events can occur independently of Lena's actions regarding academic misconduct, and considering that the hard drive failure was confirmed by the IT department, it's reasonable to conclude that these events could still happen even if Lena did commit misconduct.\n\nHowever, one might argue that if Lena were committing misconduct, she might be more inclined to fabricate or manipulate explanations for missing data or changes in methodology (like a software switch) to cover her tracks. Yet, the actual occurrence of a hard drive failure and a software switch are not directly influenced by her misconduct.\n\nThe probability judgment should reflect the likelihood that these events are unrelated to her potential misconduct but could still occur. Considering this, the events are plausible regardless of misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"

The fact that notes about these participants' issues predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude them was made before the results were known or submitted for publication.\n\n2. **Standard Research Practice**: Researchers typically document issues with participant data collection, such as a participant not understanding the task or falling asleep. These notes are usually made at the time of data collection. Excluding participants based on such documented issues is a standard practice to ensure data quality.\n\nThe scenario described aligns with good research practice. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is entirely plausible that she would exclude participants based on legitimate reasons documented before any potential bias or pressure from the publication process.\n\nThe fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports the notion that the exclusion was not done in response to the results or reviewer comments, which could have been a sign of misconduct (such as excluding participants to achieve a desired outcome).\n\nTherefore, given standard research practices and the information provided, it is highly likely that participants would be excluded based on pre-existing, legitimate reasons if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

This could include creating or altering records to justify exclusions or other data handling decisions.\n\n2. **Pre-dating Notes**: If Lena were to fabricate notes to justify excluding certain participants, she would need to ensure that these notes appear to predate the journal submission to avoid suspicion. However, fabricating such notes in a way that they convincingly predate the submission could be challenging and might raise suspicions if not done carefully.\n\nThe fact that the notes genuinely predate the journal submission and are related to legitimate reasons for exclusion (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) suggests that the exclusion was not likely fabricated for the purpose of altering the study's outcome.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, it's possible that she might not have felt the need to fabricate exclusions based on such obvious and legitimate criteria. Alternatively, she might have been careful enough to ensure that any fabrication appears legitimate and not suspicious.\n\nHowever, the given scenario doesn't directly imply fabrication regarding these specific exclusions.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset if Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to consider the potential for manipulation.\n\n1. **Selective Exclusion**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, one possible action could be selectively excluding participants to achieve a desired outcome or to make the results appear more significant. The fact that an earlier script included more participants who were later excluded could be indicative of such selective exclusion.\n\n2. **Covering Tracks**: By having an earlier version of the script that included more participants, Lena might be attempting to create a narrative that the exclusions were part of a legitimate process. However, if the exclusions were not based on predefined, legitimate criteria, this could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the results.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it's plausible that she would exclude participants in a way that is not transparent or based on predefined criteria, potentially to achieve a desired outcome. The existence of an earlier script with more participants could be part of her attempt to justify or cover her tracks regarding the exclusions made.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script included more participants who were later excluded in a manner consistent with misconduct is relatively high.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to consider the various pieces of information provided and their implications.\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns and Actions**: Several aspects of the case raise suspicions, such as the unusual distribution of p-values, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the exclusion of participants in a way that might not be fully transparent.\n\n2. **Legitimate Explanations**: There are also explanations for some of these observations that do not necessarily imply misconduct, such as the lab switching software, hardware failure, and the practice of exploring robustness through multiple analyses.\n\n3. **Lena's History and Behavior**: Lena's past record is positive, with no prior data irregularities and a history of well-documented and reproducible research. This suggests that she is capable of conducting research with integrity.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**: The pressure Lena was under, both from her supervisor's reliance on the study for a grant and her own career aspirations, could be a motivating factor for misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there are suspicious elements that suggest potential misconduct (e.g., the p-value distribution, modifications to the preregistration), there are also legitimate explanations for some of the observations, and Lena's past behavior is generally positive.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, it's challenging to be certain about Lena's actions. The probability of misconduct is not negligible due to the suspicious patterns observed, but it's also not a certainty given the context and Lena's past record.\n\nProbability judgment: 55"

While there are suspicions, they do not conclusively prove misconduct."
