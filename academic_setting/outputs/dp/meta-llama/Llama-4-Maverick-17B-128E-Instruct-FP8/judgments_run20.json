  "Based on the given evidence, I think: No\n\nThe suspicious findings, such as the unusual distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, raise concerns, but they do not provide conclusive evidence of academic misconduct. Additionally, several factors, including her previously strong record of careful data handling and the lab's standard practices, suggest that Lena may not have committed misconduct.\n\nWhile it is possible that Lena committed academic misconduct, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. Therefore, I would err on the side of caution and conclude that she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 40 (was previously computed as 60; reevaluated as 40)"
