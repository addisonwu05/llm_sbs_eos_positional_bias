The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Research projects often span several years, and labs may update their software tools for various reasons, such as improved functionality, better compatibility with other tools, or changes in standard practices within the field. Therefore, it is plausible that a lab might switch software during a project.\n\nSecond, hardware failures, including laptop hard drive failures, are not rare. Electronic devices can fail due to manufacturing defects, wear and tear, or other factors. The fact that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure and repaired it lends credibility to the claim that a genuine technical issue occurred.\n\nThe coincidence of these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) in the context of Lena's project could be seen as unfortunate but not implausible. Many research projects face technical or logistical challenges that can complicate data management and analysis.\n\nGiven that these events can occur independently of academic misconduct and that they have plausible explanations unrelated to the integrity of Lena's research, it is reasonable to consider them as potentially genuine events.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

These are independent events. A lab might switch software for reasons unrelated to any misconduct, such as those mentioned earlier (improved functionality, compatibility, etc.). Similarly, a hard drive failure is a technical issue that can occur regardless of the researcher's behavior.\n\nHowever, one might speculate that someone committing academic misconduct might be more likely to \"stage\" or fabricate explanations for inconsistencies or suspicious patterns in their data. But the specific events mentioned (software switch and hard drive failure) are not directly related to the act of misconduct itself. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure suggests that the hard drive failure was a genuine technical issue rather than a fabricated story.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these events occurring is not directly influenced by whether or not Lena committed academic misconduct.
