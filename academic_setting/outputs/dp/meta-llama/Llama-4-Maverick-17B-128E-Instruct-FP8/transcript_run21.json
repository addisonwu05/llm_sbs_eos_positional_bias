The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the lab switching software during the project and Lena's laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we can break down the scenario into its components and evaluate the probability of each.\n\n1. **Lab Switching Software During the Project**: Research labs often change or update their software tools for various reasons, including upgrades in technology, changes in methodology, or to improve efficiency. This is a relatively common occurrence, especially in fields like cognitive neuroscience where software for data analysis is frequently updated or expanded.\n\n2. **Lena's Laptop Suffering a Hard Drive Failure**: Hardware failures, including hard drive failures, are not uncommon. Laptops, in particular, are susceptible to hardware issues due to their portable nature and the potential for wear and tear. The fact that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure and repaired it around the time in question lends credibility to this being a genuine event rather than a fabricated story.\n\n3. **Coincidence of Events**: The coincidence here involves two events happening around the same time: the lab switching software and Lena's laptop experiencing a hard drive failure. While each event on its own is not extraordinary, their coincidence could be seen as unfortunate but not implausible. Research projects often span considerable periods, and multiple events, including hardware failures and software changes, can occur during that time.\n\nGiven that these are somewhat independent events (the lab's choice of software and an individual's laptop hardware failure), we can consider their probabilities separately before combining them.\n\n- The probability that a research lab switches software at some point during a multi-participant study isn't low, as research methodologies evolve. Let's assume this has a moderate probability, say around 30-40% for a study of significant duration and complexity.\n\n- The probability of a laptop hard drive failing is harder to quantify without specific data, but it's not negligible. Laptops are used extensively, and hardware failure rates can be significant over the lifespan of a device. Assuming a reasonable failure rate, the probability might be around 5-10% over the course of a few years for an actively used laptop.\n\nThe combined probability of both events happening (assuming independence) would be the product of their individual probabilities. If we take the higher end of the estimates (40% for software change and 10% for hard drive failure), the combined probability is 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04 or 4%. If we use more conservative estimates (30% and 5%), it's 0.3 * 0.05 = 0.015 or 1.5%.\n\nHowever, we're not just considering the probability of these two events happening in isolation but also assessing the plausibility that they occurred as described, given that Lena did not commit academic misconduct. The narrative that these were unfortunate coincidences or mundane issues rather than indicators of misconduct is plausible, especially given Lena's previously strong record.\n\nThus, while the coincidence of these events might seem suspicious at first, upon closer inspection, they are not so improbable as to necessarily indicate misconduct. The narrative that they are coincidental unfortunate events is plausible.\n\n60"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the lab switching software during the project and Lena's laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, assuming Lena committed academic misconduct, we consider the motivations and behaviors associated with misconduct.\n\n1. **Lab Switching Software During the Project**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, the fact that the lab switched software could potentially be used to her advantage in creating a narrative that complicates the scrutiny of her data or analysis. However, the decision to switch software is typically not within the control of an individual researcher like Lena but rather a lab or departmental decision. Thus, whether or not Lena committed misconduct, the lab's decision to switch software remains plausible and relatively likely due to the reasons mentioned earlier (upgrades, methodological changes).\n\n2. **Lena's Laptop Suffering a Confirmed Hard Drive Failure**: If Lena had committed academic misconduct and fabricated or falsified data, claiming a hard drive failure could be a convenient explanation for inconsistencies or missing original data. However, the fact that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure and repaired it adds a layer of authenticity to the claim. For this to be seen as a fabrication by Lena to cover her tracks, she would have had to anticipate the scrutiny that would lead to an investigation into the hard drive failure, which seems sophisticated but not implausible.\n\nThe key here is that, if Lena committed misconduct, she might have an incentive to fabricate explanations for discrepancies or missing data. However, the confirmation by the IT department of a hardware failure makes the story more believable and less likely to be a simple fabrication.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the probability that she would coincidentally or conveniently have a hard drive failure and that the lab would switch software is still not extremely high, but it is somewhat more plausible that these could be used as a cover story or coincide with her misconduct.\n\nHowever, the crucial factor is the confirmation of the hard drive failure by the IT department. This detail makes the event more credible, regardless of Lena's actions. Thus, while some might suspect that Lena could manipulate the narrative around these events if she were guilty of misconduct, the IT department's confirmation complicates this interpretation.\n\nThe likelihood that these events occur doesn't directly correlate with Lena's guilt or innocence in a straightforward manner because the events (software switch and hard drive failure) have plausible explanations unrelated to misconduct.\n\n70"

Her previous record supports this interpretation, as there's no indication of prior misconduct.\n\nThe likelihood that her previous studies were well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct is high because it aligns with the established pattern of her behavior.

Researchers who commit misconduct may not necessarily do so in every project. The behavior can be situational, influenced by pressures, opportunities, or rationalizations specific to a particular study or context.\n\n2. **Previous Good Record**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it doesn't necessarily mean she had done so in previous studies. However, it might suggest that she is capable of misconduct under certain circumstances. The fact that her previous studies were positively audited could indicate that either she hadn't engaged in misconduct in those studies or that the misconduct, if any, was not detectable through the audit process.\n\nResearchers who commit misconduct often have a \"clean\" record for a long time before being caught, sometimes because they are more careful or because the conditions that led to misconduct in the later instance were not present earlier.\n\nThe probability that Lena's previous studies were well-documented and reproducible if she committed misconduct in the current instance is still relatively high because it is possible for someone to engage in misconduct in one instance without having done so previously. The absence of detected misconduct in previous studies doesn't necessarily imply guilt or innocence in the current instance, but it does suggest that if she did commit misconduct, it might not be a habitual behavior or that she was more careful in the past.\n\n40"

This could be part of a broader culture of exploring data robustness and understanding the impact of different methodological choices.\n\n2. **Lab-Wide Push to Explore Robustness**: The information that there was a lab-wide push to explore robustness through running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria directly supports the notion that Lena's actions were in line with lab practices and expectations.

However, it can also occur naturally, especially if there is a real effect and the study is well-powered.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 could still occur, but it might be less likely without some form of bias in analysis choices (not necessarily misconduct). Researchers might make legitimate analytical decisions that influence the distribution of p-values.\n\nHowever, the complete absence of p-values just above .05 is unusual and could suggest some form of selective reporting or analysis bias. \n\nThe likelihood of observing such a distribution without misconduct is lower because it suggests a non-random process influencing the reported p-values.\n\n20"

This could involve selectively reporting analyses that yielded significant results while omitting or downplaying those that did not.\n\n2. **Manipulating p-values**: Misconduct could involve adjusting analyses or data until they yield significant p-values. This might result in an unusual distribution of p-values, with a high concentration just below .05 and a dearth of values just above .05.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, such as p-hacking or selective reporting, it is highly plausible that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05. This pattern is consistent with behaviors that manipulate or selectively report results to achieve statistical significance.\n\nThe absence of p-values just above .05 further supports the suspicion of misconduct, as it suggests that results that were not significant may have been excluded or altered.\n\n85"
