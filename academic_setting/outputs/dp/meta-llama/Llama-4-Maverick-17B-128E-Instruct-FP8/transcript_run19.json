The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the lab switching software during the project and Lena's laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we should consider the plausibility and frequency of such events in a research setting.\n\n1. **Lab Switching Software**: Research labs, especially those in rapidly evolving fields like cognitive neuroscience, frequently update or change their software tools for data analysis. This can be due to various reasons such as the need for more advanced statistical capabilities, better compatibility with new data formats, or simply because a different package becomes the standard in the field. Therefore, switching statistical software halfway through a project is not unusual, especially if the project spans several years, as is common with PhD research.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: Hard drive failures are not uncommon. Electronic devices can fail due to manufacturing defects, wear and tear, or unexpected physical stress. Laptops, being portable, are perhaps more susceptible to physical stress (e.g., being knocked or spilled on) that could lead to hardware failure. The fact that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure and repaired it lends credibility to the occurrence of a genuine hard drive failure.\n\n3. **Coincidence of Events**: The coincidence of the lab switching software and Lena experiencing a hard drive failure might seem unusual at first glance. However, these are somewhat independent events. The lab's decision to switch software is typically based on broader considerations than an individual's project, and hardware failures, while unfortunate, are not so rare as to be considered highly improbable.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's reasonable to conclude that both events could occur without implying any academic misconduct on Lena's part. Labs do switch software for legitimate reasons, and hardware failures are an unfortunate but recognized risk in computing.\n\nTherefore, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is somewhat likely (or plausible) that the described events could occur.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

Claiming a hard drive failure or citing the switch in software as reasons for irregularities could serve as a plausible cover story for alterations made to the data or analyses.\n\n2. **Lab Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure as Independent Events**: Even if Lena committed academic misconduct, the events of the lab switching software and her laptop suffering a hard drive failure are largely independent of her actions regarding misconduct. The decision to switch software is typically made at a level beyond an individual graduate student's control, and hardware failures are generally beyond one's control (though one could potentially stage a failure, this is less likely and would require specific technical knowledge).\n\n3. **Plausibility of the Events Regardless of Misconduct**: The occurrence of a software switch and a hard drive failure are plausible regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct. The question then becomes whether these events are more or less likely if she did commit misconduct.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it's possible she might be more inclined to highlight or even fabricate issues like a hard drive failure to explain discrepancies. However, the actual occurrence of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) isn't directly influenced by her misconduct. \n\nThe lab's decision to switch software and the occurrence of a hard drive failure can happen regardless of Lena's actions, and there is no direct evidence to suggest these events were fabricated or staged by Lena.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena committed academic misconduct, the probability of these events (lab switching software and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure) remains plausible as they are not necessarily directly related to her actions.\n\nProbability judgment: 55"

If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it suggests a potential willingness to compromise research integrity for her goals.\n\n2. **Consistency of Misconduct**: The question then arises whether someone who commits misconduct in one study is likely to have done so in previous studies as well.

If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, there are a few possibilities:\n    - She might have been more careful or lucky in her previous studies, avoiding detection.\n    - She might have committed misconduct previously but was not caught due to less stringent audits or oversight.\n    - Alternatively, the misconduct in the current study could be an isolated incident.\n\nHowever, it is less likely that someone who commits misconduct would consistently produce work that passes audits and is praised for its quality, as this suggests a level of integrity and transparency.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is somewhat counterintuitive that her previous work was of high quality and passed audits, as one might expect a pattern of behavior.

Excluding such participants based on predefined criteria or post-data collection review is a standard practice.\n\n2. **Documentation Predating Journal Submission**: The fact that the notes justifying the exclusion of these participants predate the journal submission is significant. It suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known or before there was any potential pressure to manipulate the data to achieve a certain outcome. This timing is consistent with good research practice, where decisions about data inclusion/exclusion are typically made based on criteria established before analyzing the data for the main research questions.\n\n3. **Implication of Integrity**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies that she followed proper research practices, including transparently documenting her decisions regarding participant exclusion. The existence of notes predating the journal submission supports the notion that the exclusions were made in good faith and based on legitimate reasons.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that participants who did not meet the criteria for inclusion (e.g., due to falling asleep or not understanding the instructions) would be excluded based on documented reasons that were noted before any potential bias could influence the decision (such as the outcome of the study or the need to achieve a certain result for publication).\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

However, creating notes that predate the journal submission to justify exclusions could be seen as part of a cover-up or an attempt to make her actions appear legitimate.\n\n2. **Pre-dating Notes as a Precaution**: An individual committing misconduct might take steps to make their actions appear legitimate by creating or ensuring that certain documentation (like exclusion notes) exists and predates any potential scrutiny or submission for publication. This could be seen as a precautionary measure to avoid raising suspicions.\n\n3. **Plausibility of Genuine Exclusions**: Even if Lena committed academic misconduct in terms of data analysis or results reporting, it's still plausible that she genuinely excluded participants based on valid reasons (like not understanding instructions or falling asleep) and documented these reasons appropriately. The act of excluding participants for valid reasons and documenting this before any potential misconduct does not necessarily imply misconduct.\n\nHowever, the fact that these notes predate the journal submission could either be a genuine practice or a fabricated alibi.

This can involve excluding participants who did not meet certain criteria, such as not understanding the task, failing to complete it, or having data quality issues.\n\n2. **Exclusion Criteria**: Applying exclusion criteria is a standard practice to ensure that the analysis is based on a dataset that is as clean and relevant as possible. If Lena followed good research practices, she would have documented these criteria and applied them consistently.\n\n3. **Earlier Versions of Analysis Scripts**: The existence of earlier versions of analysis scripts that include more participants than the final dataset is not unusual. It reflects the process of refining the analysis based on the data. Automated backups can capture these earlier versions, providing a record of how the analysis evolved.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is plausible and consistent with good research practices that an earlier analysis script would include more participants, with some being excluded later based on established criteria. This is a normal part of the data analysis process.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset if Lena committed academic misconduct, we should consider the potential implications of misconduct on data handling and analysis practices.\n\n1. **Selective Exclusion**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, one possible action could be selectively excluding participants to achieve desired results or to manipulate the data in some way. This could involve excluding participants whose data do not support the hypothesis or whose inclusion would lead to non-significant results.\n\n2. **Earlier Versions of Scripts**: The existence of earlier analysis scripts that include more participants could be consistent with a process of refining the analysis. However, if Lena committed misconduct, the exclusion of certain participants might not be based on legitimate criteria but rather on achieving a particular outcome.\n\n3. **Misconduct and Data Manipulation**: Committing academic misconduct could involve manipulating the dataset, including deciding which participants to include or exclude, to achieve the desired results. The fact that an earlier script included more participants suggests that there was a process of refining the dataset, which could be legitimate or could be part of a process of data manipulation.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is plausible that she might exclude certain participants in a way that is not transparent or based on pre-specified criteria, potentially leaving a trail in earlier versions of the analysis scripts.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
