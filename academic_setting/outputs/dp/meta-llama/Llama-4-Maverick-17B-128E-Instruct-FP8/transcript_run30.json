The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

It's not uncommon for labs to change or update their software tools for various reasons such as updates in technology, availability of new tools with better functionalities, or changes in lab personnel or collaborations that might necessitate or prefer different software. This event is plausible and can happen for reasons entirely unrelated to academic misconduct.\n\nSecond, regarding Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure, hardware failures are not rare. Electronic devices can fail due to manufacturing defects, wear and tear, or other unforeseen circumstances. The fact that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure and repaired it lends credibility to the occurrence of this event.\n\nThe coincidence of these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) happening in the context of Lena's project could be seen as unfortunate but not implausible. Labs often undergo changes, and hardware failures are an occupational hazard in environments heavily reliant on electronic devices.\n\nTo assess the likelihood, we must consider whether these events are independent of Lena's actions or if they are somehow linked to potential misconduct. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the occurrence of these events is not directly related to her behavior. The switching of software could be a legitimate change due to lab needs or preferences, and the hard drive failure is an unfortunate but possible event.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the coincidence might raise some eyebrows, it's not entirely improbable. Labs and researchers often face challenges like software changes and hardware failures.\n\nTherefore, considering the explanations and the context that these are not uncommon occurrences, the likelihood that these events happened without Lena committing academic misconduct is moderate to relatively high.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

Claiming a hard drive failure or citing a software switch could be part of creating a plausible explanation for inconsistencies that might otherwise arouse suspicion.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether committing academic misconduct directly influences the likelihood of a lab switching software or a laptop suffering a hard drive failure. These are largely independent events. The decision to switch software is typically made at a lab or institutional level and is not directly related to individual misconduct. Similarly, a hard drive failure is a hardware issue that is not directly caused by academic misconduct, although one might speculate that a person committing misconduct could potentially \"cause\" a failure by attempting to destroy evidence.\n\nThat being said, if Lena committed misconduct, she might have an incentive to claim a hard drive failure to explain missing original data or discrepancies. However, the fact that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure makes it more plausible that the failure was genuine rather than fabricated.\n\nThe events in question (software switch and hard drive failure) are not directly caused by academic misconduct. Thus, the likelihood of these events happening is not significantly altered by whether or not Lena committed misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that these events occurred is relatively unchanged by the assumption of misconduct because they are largely outside of Lena's control and not directly related to her actions.\n\nProbability judgment: 55"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to synthesize the various pieces of information and evaluate their implications.\n\n1. **Lab and Data Handling Practices**: The lab switched software, and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure. These events are plausible and not directly indicative of misconduct.\n   \n2. **Analysis Scripts and Data Management**: The lab's data management logs show multiple alternative analysis scripts, which is consistent with lab practices and not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\n3. **Participant Exclusion**: Two participants were excluded based on pre-existing notes, which is a legitimate research practice.\n\n4. **Previous Record**: Lena has no prior record of data irregularities and her previous studies passed an independent data audit, suggesting a history of good research practices.\n\n5. **Pressure and Intent**: Lena expressed pressure to make the study \"work\" due to its importance for her supervisor's grant and her own career. While this indicates stress, it doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\n6. **Preregistration Document**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which raises concerns about potential manipulation.\n\n7. **P-value Distribution**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, which is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or other forms of result manipulation.\n\nConsidering these points, the most concerning evidence is the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the suspicious distribution of p-values. These factors suggest potential misconduct, such as manipulating analyses or results to achieve significance.\n\nWhile Lena has a previously clean record and some of the other evidence does not directly indicate misconduct, the concerning evidence outweighs the benign or neutral factors. The pressure she was under and the suspicious patterns in the data and analysis practices contribute to the likelihood of misconduct.\n\nGiven the evidence, it seems plausible that Lena might have engaged in some form of academic misconduct, particularly given the suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
