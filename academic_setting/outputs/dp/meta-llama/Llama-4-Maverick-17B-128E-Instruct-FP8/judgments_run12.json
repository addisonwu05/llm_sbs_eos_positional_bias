  "Based on the evidence and analysis, I would say: No.\n\nWhile there are several red flags and suspicious circumstances, such as the unusual pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, there are also explanations and evidence that suggest Lena may not have committed academic misconduct. The presence of multiple analysis scripts and the exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes are consistent with standard research practices. Additionally, Lena's previous good record and the lack of direct evidence of data fabrication or falsification contribute to the uncertainty.\n\nUltimately, the decision to conclude that Lena committed academic misconduct would require a more definitive and direct evidence than is currently available. Given the mixed nature of the evidence and the complexity of the situation, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion. \n\nHowever, as per the specific request, the response is: No."
