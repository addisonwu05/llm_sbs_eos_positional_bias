The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This can be due to various reasons such as improved functionality, better compatibility with new data formats, or enhanced statistical capabilities. Switching software halfway through a project is not uncommon, especially if the new software offers significant advantages or if there was an initial uncertainty about which software would be most appropriate.\n\n2. **Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: Hardware failures, including hard drive failures, are not rare. Laptops, being portable and subject to various environmental conditions, can be prone to hardware issues. The frequency of hard drive failures can vary based on the hardware quality, usage patterns, and handling. A confirmed hard drive failure leading to some missing files is unfortunate but plausible.\n\nBoth events are within the realm of common occurrences in a research setting. Labs often adapt and change their methodologies and tools as projects evolve, and hardware failures are an unfortunate but recognized risk in computing.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the described events could happen without implying academic misconduct by Lena.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

Labs might switch software for reasons such as improved functionality, collaboration requirements, or departmental recommendations. Whether Lena committed misconduct or not, the lab's decision to switch software would likely be based on factors unrelated to her actions.\n\n2. **Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure is a hardware issue that is generally unrelated to the actions of the user in terms of misconduct. While it's conceivable that mishandling could cause a hardware failure, a \"confirmed hard drive failure\" suggests a genuine hardware issue rather than something staged. Individuals committing misconduct might potentially fabricate evidence of a hardware failure, but the fact that it's \"confirmed\" by the IT department implies an actual hardware issue rather than a fabricated one.\n\nThe occurrence of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) is not directly related to whether Lena committed academic misconduct. They are plausible as coincidental events.\n\nTherefore, assuming Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of these events happening is still relatively plausible because they are not directly related to her misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

This is a standard practice to ensure data quality.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Documenting reasons for participant exclusion in raw data files is a good practice. It provides a clear audit trail that can be useful for verifying the integrity of the data analysis process.\n\n3. **Timing of Exclusion Notes**: The fact that the notes predating the journal submission indicate that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known or submitted for publication. This suggests that the exclusion was based on pre-established criteria rather than post-hoc rationalization related to the study's findings.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's reasonable to expect that she would follow standard practices for data handling and participant exclusion. Excluding participants who did not meet the task requirements (e.g., staying awake and understanding instructions) is a normal part of data cleaning and preprocessing. Documenting these exclusions in a manner that predates the journal submission supports the notion that these decisions were made independently of the study's outcomes.\n\nTherefore, it is quite likely that two such participants would be excluded based on pre-existing notes.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

However, the specific action of excluding participants based on pre-existing notes is not directly related to falsifying the outcome but rather to the integrity of the data preprocessing steps.\n\n2. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that notes predating the journal submission exist and justify the exclusion of participants suggests that these exclusions were genuinely made before the submission. If Lena had committed misconduct with the intent to manipulate results, it might be expected that she could either fabricate such notes or ensure that the exclusions were made in a way that supported her desired outcomes.\n\nHowever, having genuine or fabricated notes that predate the journal submission and justify exclusions based on legitimate criteria (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions) doesn't necessarily contradict the possibility of misconduct elsewhere in the data handling or analysis process. It simply indicates that, for these specific participants, the exclusion was either genuinely done as claimed or was fabricated in a way that mimics good research practice.\n\nGiven that the exclusions are based on plausible criteria and are documented in a way that suggests they were made before the journal submission, it's still plausible that these exclusions were made as described, even if Lena committed misconduct.\n\nTherefore, the existence of such notes and the exclusion based on them doesn't strongly indicate either way regarding misconduct.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to consider the various pieces of information provided.\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns and Evidence**: Several pieces of evidence raise suspicions, such as the high concentration of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the exclusion of participants in the final dataset.\n\n2. **Plausible Explanations**: Some of these actions could be justified as part of normal research practices or due to legitimate reasons (e.g., exploring robustness, correcting errors). However, the timing and nature of some changes (like modifying the preregistration document after data collection) are concerning.\n\n3. **Lena's Past Behavior and Context**: Lena's previous work was well-regarded, and she had no history of misconduct. She was under significant pressure due to the grant situation and her career prospects.\n\n4. **Emails and Pressure**: The emails suggest she was under a lot of pressure and felt that the study's success was crucial for her career and the lab's funding.\n\nWhile there are indicators that raise suspicions about Lena's actions (e.g., p-values distribution, changes to preregistration), there are also plausible explanations and contextual factors (e.g., pressure, previous good behavior) that need to be considered.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence and the complexity of the situation, it seems that while there are red flags, they do not conclusively prove misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
