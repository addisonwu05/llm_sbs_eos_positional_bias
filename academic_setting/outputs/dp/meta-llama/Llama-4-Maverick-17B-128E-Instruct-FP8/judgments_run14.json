  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I conclude that the available information does not definitively prove Alex's guilt or innocence. However, the accumulation of circumstantial evidence (such as being seen near the printer, plastic fragments in the trash, and prior frustration with the printer) leans towards a plausible case against Alex, even though there are alternative explanations and mitigating factors.\n\nTherefore, my judgment, based on the provided probability (60), is that it is more likely than not that Alex broke the printer.\n\nYes"
