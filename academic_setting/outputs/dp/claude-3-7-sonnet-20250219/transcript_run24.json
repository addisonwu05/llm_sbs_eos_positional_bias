The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Compatibility issues with new data formats or analyses\n3. Cost considerations (licensing fees for the original software becoming too expensive)\n4. Departmental or institutional mandates to standardize software\n5. Collaborator preferences necessitating a change\n\nThese transitions can be disruptive but are a normal part of academic research environments that evolve over time.\n\nRegarding the hard drive failure:\n1. Hard drive failures are common technical issues that researchers face\n2. The IT department independently confirmed both the report and repair of the hardware failure\n3. The timing aligns with the period when files went missing\n4. This represents external verification from a department that would have no obvious incentive to cover for Lena\n\nThe combination of these events - software switching and hard drive failure - would certainly create complications in maintaining perfect records and file continuity. This would be particularly challenging for a PhD student managing a complex project with multiple analyses.\n\nThese circumstances represent ordinary, if unfortunate, challenges that researchers regularly encounter. They provide a plausible non-fraudulent explanation for any inconsistencies or gaps in the data trail.

Opportunistic exploitation: Lena might have taken advantage of legitimate disruptions to cover misconduct. The software transition creates a natural explanation for inconsistencies between earlier and later analyses, which could mask deliberate manipulation.\n\n2.

Someone engaging in fraud might point to this confirmed event to explain why they cannot produce certain requested files during an investigation.\n\n3. Partial fabrication: The hard drive failure is independently confirmed by IT, suggesting it genuinely occurred. However, a researcher committing misconduct might exaggerate the extent of lost data or selectively claim that specifically incriminating files were lost.\n\n4.

First-time misconduct: Researchers who engage in misconduct don't necessarily do so from the beginning of their careers. Lena might have conducted her earlier work with complete integrity but succumbed to pressure in this high-profile study, especially given the context of her supervisor's pressure to produce publishable findings before a grant review.\n\n2.

Situational factors: The current study might have presented unique challenges or pressures not present in previous work. The high-profile nature of this experiment and explicit pressure from Professor Mills creates a different incentive structure than her earlier projects may have had.\n\n4. Improved skills at deception: Less likely but possible is that Lena's earlier misconduct was simply not detected. As researchers gain experience, those who engage in misconduct might become more sophisticated at hiding it.\n\n5. Genuine competence coupled with dishonesty: Lena might be genuinely skilled at data management and documentation (as evidenced by her earlier work), making her capable of producing both legitimate research and, when motivated, convincing fabrications.\n\nResearch on scientific misconduct suggests that environmental pressures, career stage, and specific project circumstances strongly influence misconduct decisions.

The point of preregistration is to document decisions about study design, data collection, and analysis plans before seeing the data, to prevent unconscious or conscious bias from influencing analytical choices.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, potential explanations for this modification might include:\n\n1.

In legitimate research, we would expect to see roughly equal numbers of p-values just below and just above any arbitrary threshold.\n\n4. **Exploratory analyses vulnerability**: This pattern appearing specifically in exploratory analyses is even more concerning, as these analyses typically have fewer constraints and more researcher degrees of freedom.\n\n5. **Meta-scientific evidence**: Multiple meta-research studies have shown that this specific pattern (clustering just below .05 with few values just above) is strongly associated with publication bias and questionable research practices.\n\nWhile there are rare situations where unusual p-value distributions might occur legitimately (e.g., very specific study designs with unique statistical properties), the pattern described here matches almost exactly what methodologists would expect to see from selective reporting or data manipulation aimed at achieving statistical significance.\n\nFor this pattern to occur without misconduct would require an extremely unusual and coincidental combination of genuine effects that happen to produce multiple p-values just below the conventional significance threshold.\n\nProbability: 10"

This distribution represents one of the most recognized statistical fingerprints of data manipulation in the scientific literature.\n\nHere's why this pattern strongly suggests misconduct:\n\n1. **Direct evidence of p-hacking**: This distribution is precisely what results from p-hacking - running multiple analyses or adjusting parameters until results cross the significance threshold, then reporting only those that \"worked.\"\n\n2. **Selective reporting signature**: The absence of p-values just above .05 specifically indicates that analyses producing \"near-miss\" results were likely discarded or modified until they reached significance.\n\n3. **Statistical impossibility**: The discontinuity in the p-value distribution around .05 cannot be explained by chance or legitimate statistical processes - it specifically indicates human intervention based on the threshold.\n\n4. **Focus on exploratory analyses**: That this pattern appears in exploratory analyses is telling, as these offer the greatest flexibility for manipulation without the constraints of preregistration.\n\n5. **Alignment with scientific misconduct literature**: This exact pattern has been extensively documented in meta-scientific research as a reliable indicator of questionable research practices or outright fraud.\n\n6. **Matches whistleblower concerns**: This statistical anomaly directly supports the whistleblower's claim that the data \"look too perfect\" - the results appear artificially engineered to meet publication standards.\n\nThis pattern is so widely recognized as problematic that it has led to the development of specific statistical tests (p-curve analyses, excess significance tests) designed to detect such manipulation. When researchers intentionally manipulate analyses to achieve significance, this clustering of p-values just below .05 is precisely the pattern that emerges.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to analyze all the evidence presented:\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection** - Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a serious violation of research integrity. This is perhaps the strongest single piece of evidence.\n\n2. **P-value distribution** - The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a well-established statistical signature of p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions** - Earlier analysis scripts included participants who were later excluded, suggesting possible strategic removal of data points.\n\n4. **Motivation and pressure** - Emails explicitly stating that \"a null result would kill my chances\" and \"I need this one to work\" establish clear motive.\n\n5. **Whistleblower concerns** - Initial allegations that data \"look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed\" have been substantiated by multiple pieces of evidence.\n\n**Evidence suggesting innocence or mitigating factors:**\n\n1. **Previously strong record** - Lena passed an independent audit for previous work, which was rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. **Multiple analysis scripts** - The lab had a practice of exploring robustness through multiple analyses, which other students also followed.\n\n3. **Technical issues** - Software switching and confirmed hard drive failure could explain some inconsistencies in the data trail.\n\n4. **Valid exclusions** - Some participant exclusions were documented before submission with legitimate reasons.\n\nWhen weighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution, both of which are difficult to explain through innocent means. The explicit statements about needing positive results, combined with concrete evidence of changes to analyses that would help achieve those results, create a consistent pattern.\n\nWhile Lena's prior good record deserves consideration, the specific evidence in this case points strongly toward intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nProbability: 85"

The most compelling factors include: modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes; the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above; documented changes in participant inclusion between early and final analyses; and explicit statements in emails about needing positive results. While there are some mitigating factors like her previously strong record, the technical issues with software and hard drive failure could have been opportunistically used to obscure evidence of manipulation. The pattern of evidence collectively points to intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired significant results rather than honest reporting of findings."
