The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The progressive application of pre-determined exclusion criteria is standard practice. Not all exclusions may be applied simultaneously in early analyses.\n\n4. Exploratory analyses often begin with more inclusive datasets before researchers determine which exclusion criteria are methodologically necessary.\n\n5. The fact that these earlier scripts were found in automated backups rather than being deliberately preserved could actually support innocence - someone attempting to hide questionable exclusions would likely delete such scripts.\n\nWithout knowing the specific reasons for the exclusions, the mere existence of earlier scripts with more participants is entirely consistent with normal, ethical research practices where data cleaning and application of exclusion criteria happens progressively throughout the analysis process.\n\nFor a researcher not engaging in misconduct, this progression from more inclusive to more refined datasets is standard scientific practice.\n\n85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the pattern of participants being included in earlier scripts but excluded in the final dataset would align perfectly with certain forms of data manipulation.\n\nThis pattern is highly consistent with result-driven exclusion practices:\n\n1. Post-hoc participant removal is a classic method of p-hacking. A researcher looking to achieve significant results might run initial analyses with all participants, identify which participants' data work against the desired outcome, and then develop post-hoc justifications for excluding them.\n\n2. The progression from more to fewer participants, discoverable only through automated backups rather than transparent documentation, suggests potential concealment of the decision-making process behind these exclusions.\n\n3. This approach allows for selective pruning of the dataset while maintaining the appearance of objective criteria. A researcher could try different exclusion combinations until reaching the desired statistical significance.\n\n4. The automated backup capturing this earlier version with more participants is particularly telling - it suggests these exclusion decisions may not have been properly documented or justified at the time they were made.\n\n5. In the context of the other evidence (modified preregistration, p-values clustering just below .05), this pattern of progressive participant exclusion fits into a coherent picture of manipulating analyses to reach significance thresholds.\n\n6. This technique is especially effective because it's difficult to detect without access to earlier versions of analysis scripts - exactly what was accidentally preserved in this case through automated backups.\n\nFor someone engaging in misconduct with the goal of producing significant results, this pattern of selectively removing participants who don't support the hypothesis between early and final analyses would be a highly effective and commonly employed strategy.\n\n95"

This is a severe breach of research integrity.\n\n2. **Unusual p-value distribution:** The final dataset shows many p-values just below .05 (.047, .049, .041) and almost none just above it. This pattern is a well-established statistical signature of p-hacking.\n\n3. **Participant exclusion patterns:** Earlier analysis scripts had more participants than the final dataset, suggesting potential selective removal to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Motivational emails:** Lena expressed strong career pressure and a results-oriented mindset in emails, writing that she \"needs this one to work.\"\n\n**Potentially neutral evidence:**\n\n1. **Multiple analysis scripts:** While concerning, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria was part of a lab-wide robustness initiative.\n\n2. **Technical issues:** The software switch and hard drive failure are plausible explanations for some inconsistencies, with IT confirmation of the hardware failure.\n\n**Evidence against misconduct:**\n\n1. **Clean prior record:** Lena's previous work passed an independent data audit and was rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. **Documented legitimate exclusions:** Two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions were excluded based on contemporaneous notes.\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration document and the unusual p-value distribution. Both are strong statistical red flags that are difficult to explain through chance or honest mistakes. The combination of these indicators, alongside the selective participant exclusion and expressed career pressures, creates a compelling pattern.\n\nWhile Lena has no prior history of misconduct, the current evidence shows multiple classic signatures of data manipulation specifically designed to achieve statistical significance.\n\n90"
