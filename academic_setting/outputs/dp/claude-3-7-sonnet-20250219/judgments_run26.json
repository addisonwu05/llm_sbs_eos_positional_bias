  "No.\n\nWhile there are several pieces of circumstantial evidence pointing to Alex (his expressed frustration, plastic fragments in his trash, presence near the printer before failure, and inconsistent statements), there are also significant factors suggesting he didn't break it:\n\n- The printer model has documented issues with the fuser unit and identical failures in other departments\n- Alex proactively reported the printer making grinding noises days earlier\n- Security footage shows another employee (Jamie) handling the printer roughly\n- Alex had left the building when the critical error actually occurred\n- Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment problems\n\nThe timing could be coincidental, his statements might reflect genuine confusion, and the fragments could be misidentified or placed in his trash through other means. Given the documented mechanical issues with this printer model, it seems more likely that the printer failed due to its known defects, possibly accelerated by Jamie's handling, rather than through deliberate or reckless action by Alex."
