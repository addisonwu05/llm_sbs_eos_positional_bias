  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe Alex did break the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- The plastic fragments in Alex's trash that matched the broken printer tray\n- Alex being the last person seen at the printer just minutes before it failed\n- The progression of frustration documented in team chat\n- The inconsistency in Alex's statements about using the printer\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors like the printer model's history of failures and Alex's prior reporting of issues, the physical evidence connecting Alex directly to the broken components is particularly difficult to explain if Alex is innocent.\n\nNo"
