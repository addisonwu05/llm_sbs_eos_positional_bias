The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The context mentions Professor Mills is under pressure to produce publishable results before a grant review. This increased pressure might have led Lena to compromise her standards for the first time.\n\n2. **Escalating behaviors**: Research misconduct sometimes develops gradually.

Earlier instances might have been smaller in scale or less sophisticated, making them harder to detect.\n\n4. **Different scrutiny levels**: The previous audit might not have been as thorough as the current investigation, especially if it wasn't triggered by specific concerns.\n\n5. **Different study characteristics**: The previous studies might have been less complex or had more straightforward results, requiring less manipulation to achieve publication.\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n- Independent audits can miss misconduct, especially if they focus more on documentation and reproducibility of the provided materials rather than validating the raw data collection itself\n- Well-documented studies can still contain fabricated data if the fabrication is consistent and the documentation is created to match the fabricated data\n- The fact that the whistleblower specifically targeted this study suggests something might be different about this particular project\n\nGiven that Lena's previous work passed a formal independent audit that specifically examined her raw data and scripts (not just published results), it would be somewhat surprising if she had been engaging in serious misconduct previously without detection.

Even when there are true effects, the distribution of p-values should generally be smooth, with no sharp discontinuities around the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **\"Too many\" values just below significance**: Finding an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with a notable absence of values just above .05 creates what statisticians call a \"p-curve discontinuity\" or \"p-hacking cliff.\"\n\n3. **Probability of this pattern occurring naturally**: Statistical analyses of published literature show this pattern is extremely unlikely to occur by chance. When researchers analyze data without selective reporting or p-hacking, there should be approximately as many p-values just above .05 as just below.\n\n4. **Specific to exploratory analyses**: The fact this pattern appears in exploratory analyses is especially concerning, as these analyses typically have fewer constraints and more researcher degrees of freedom.\n\n5. **Multiple affected analyses**: The description indicates this pattern appears across \"several\" exploratory analyses, making it even less likely to be a random occurrence.\n\nThis specific distribution pattern has been widely studied in statistical literature and is considered one of the strongest statistical fingerprints of p-hacking or selective reporting. The natural distribution of p-values, even when true effects exist, does not produce this distinctive cliff-like pattern around the significance threshold.\n\nFor a researcher not engaging in misconduct, obtaining this specific pattern across multiple analyses would be highly unusual and statistically improbable.\n\n10"

This pattern emerges when researchers engage in various forms of data manipulation to push borderline results into statistical significance.\n\n2. **Mechanism of creation**: This distinctive pattern typically occurs when researchers:\n   - Try multiple analytical approaches until finding one that yields p < .05\n   - Selectively exclude or include participants to achieve significance\n   - Run analyses repeatedly while adjusting parameters until crossing the significance threshold\n   - Stop collecting data once a significant result is achieved\n   - Report only the analyses that \"worked\" (p < .05)\n\n3. **Multiple affected analyses**: The fact that \"several exploratory analyses\" show this pattern suggests systematic p-hacking across different parts of the study, not just a single anomalous result.\n\n4. **Exploratory analyses vulnerability**: Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to p-hacking because they typically have fewer constraints and allow more researcher flexibility in analytical choices.\n\n5. **Statistical impossibility**: This distribution pattern is statistically highly improbable under honest analysis conditions - values should not cluster just below an arbitrary threshold like .05 while being notably absent just above it.\n\nThis p-value distribution is precisely what we would expect to see if a researcher was manipulating analyses to achieve statistical significance. Large-scale analyses of research literature have identified this pattern as a strong indicator of publication bias and questionable research practices.\n\nFor someone committing misconduct aimed at producing significant results, this pattern would be a natural consequence of their efforts to push results below the significance threshold.\n\n95"

    "content": "To assess whether Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to carefully evaluate all the evidence presented:\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a serious violation of research integrity.\n\n2. **P-value distribution**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above. This pattern is a well-established statistical fingerprint of p-hacking that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Emails expressing pressure**: Lena wrote that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and that she \"needs this one to work,\" revealing strong outcome-oriented motivations.\n\n4. **Participant exclusions**: Earlier analysis scripts included additional participants who were later excluded, which could indicate selective removal to achieve desired results.\n\n**Evidence suggesting no misconduct:**\n\n1. **Prior clean record**: Lena's previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. **Valid exclusions**: Two participants were excluded based on documented issues (falling asleep/not understanding instructions), with notes predating the journal submission.\n\n3. **Multiple analysis scripts**: The lab had a culture of testing robustness through multiple analyses, and other students showed similar patterns.\n\n4. **Technical explanations**: The lab switched statistical software mid-project and Lena experienced a confirmed hard drive failure that led to missing files.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the anomalous p-value distribution. These are recognized as strong indicators of misconduct that are difficult to explain through innocent means. The p-value distribution in particular is a statistical pattern that rarely occurs naturally but is a common result of p-hacking.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some valid exclusions, these don't adequately explain the modified preregistration or the statistical anomalies in the p-values.\n\nBased on all the evidence presented, there appears to be a high probability that some form of academic misconduct occurred.\n\n85"
