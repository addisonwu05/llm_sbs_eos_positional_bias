Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The plastic fragments under Alex's desk are concerning but inconclusive - they could be from something unrelated or possibly from earlier printer maintenance that Alex attempted before the complete failure.\n\nIf Alex is innocent, the timing makes perfect sense - the printer was either already damaged by someone else, developing an internal fault, or continuing to be used by others until it finally failed.

For example, he might have cracked internal components or dislodged something that took a few minutes to fully fail. This is quite plausible with electronics and mechanical devices.\n\n2. Alex might have intentionally damaged the printer in a way designed to fail after he left, perhaps to avoid being directly connected to the breakdown.\n\n3. The printer's error logging system might have a delay between when physical damage occurs and when the system registers and logs a critical hardware error. The printer might have attempted recovery procedures before finally registering the critical error.\n\n4. Alex might have damaged the printer, then it continued to function marginally until someone else tried to use it seven minutes later, at which point the system recognized and logged the critical failure.\n\nThe plastic fragments found in Alex's trash and the slightly ajar side panel are consistent with someone who may have broken something and tried to dispose of the evidence. The seven-minute gap between leaving and the error recording would be a logical consequence if Alex wanted to create plausible deniability.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Alex did break the printer, the observed timing pattern is quite likely and consistent with how someone might act if they damaged office equipment and wanted to avoid being caught.\n\nProbability: 75"

Previous maintenance: Alex might have attempted to fix minor issues with the printer earlier (consistent with their pattern of reporting equipment problems), and some plastic pieces might have come loose during this attempt at repair rather than destructive action.\n\n4. Environmental factors: If the office has cleaning staff or shared trash collection, fragments from elsewhere might have been moved to Alex's trash can.\n\n5. Planted evidence: Though less likely, if someone else broke the printer, they might have deliberately placed fragments in Alex's trash to deflect blame.\n\nHowever, the specific location of these fragments in Alex's personal trash can creates a direct physical connection that's difficult to explain through innocent means. While there are potential explanations, they require additional assumptions that make them less probable than the straightforward explanation that Alex had contact with the broken printer parts.\n\nProbability: 25"

Direct physical evidence: If Alex damaged the printer, small fragments would likely break off during the incident. Someone who breaks something instinctively collects and disposes of the evidence to avoid detection.\n\n2. Personal trash choice: Choosing to dispose of incriminating fragments in one's own desk trash rather than a common area trash can would be a quick decision made to immediately hide evidence without drawing attention by walking elsewhere.\n\n3. Attempted concealment: The fragments weren't disposed of in the trash can near the printer where they might be more easily connected to the damage, suggesting deliberate removal from the scene.\n\n4. Color and texture match: The technician's observation that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken paper tray creates a direct material connection that would be expected if Alex broke that specific part.\n\n5. Incomplete disposal: People who hastily dispose of evidence often fail to completely eliminate all traces - finding some but not all fragments is exactly what we'd expect if Alex quickly gathered visible pieces but missed some at the scene.\n\nThis evidence creates a logical chain: if Alex broke the printer, they would likely take fragments with them, dispose of them quickly in their personal trash, and the fragments would match the damaged component. Finding these fragments is precisely what we would expect if Alex was responsible for the damage.\n\nProbability: 90"
