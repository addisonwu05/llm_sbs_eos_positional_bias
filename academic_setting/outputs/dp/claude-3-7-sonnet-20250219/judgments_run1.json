  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Alex probably broke the printer, but there remains some reasonable doubt. The presence of matching plastic fragments in Alex's trash, Alex being seen at the printer shortly before failure, the inconsistent statements about printer usage, and the expressed frustration all point toward Alex's involvement. However, the timing discrepancy with Alex badging out before the error occurred, the printer's documented history of failures, and Alex's prior responsible reporting behavior introduce some uncertainty.\n\nWhile the evidence is not conclusive, the weight of it leans toward Alex's responsibility.\n\nNo"
