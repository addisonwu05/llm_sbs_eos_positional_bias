  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer. While some evidence raises questions (like the plastic fragments and Alex's presence near the printer shortly before failure), the stronger evidence points to Alex's innocence: the badge records showing Alex left before the failure, Alex's history of properly reporting equipment issues, the documented pattern of similar failures in this printer model, and the security footage of Jamie's rough handling. These factors collectively suggest the printer likely failed due to its known mechanical issues, possibly exacerbated by Jamie's actions, rather than deliberate damage by Alex."
