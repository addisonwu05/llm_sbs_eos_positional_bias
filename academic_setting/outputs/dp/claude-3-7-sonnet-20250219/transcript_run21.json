The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department's confirmation of the hardware repair provides external verification that at least the hard drive failure was a real event.\n\nIf Lena were fabricating data, inventing both a software change and a hard drive failure would be creating unnecessarily complex excuses when simpler explanations for any irregularities would be available.

Natural distribution: Genuinely random sampling from true effects typically produces a smooth distribution of p-values. Finding many p-values clustered just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with an abrupt drop-off above .05 contradicts expected statistical patterns.\n\n2.

Selective reporting: If Lena tested multiple hypotheses or variants of analyses but only reported those yielding p < .05, this would naturally create the observed distribution pattern.\n\n3.

Scientific norms: The scientific community widely recognizes that changing preregistered plans after seeing data without transparent disclosure constitutes questionable research practices at minimum.\n\n4. Technical awareness: Researchers who use preregistration are typically aware that platforms record timestamps and modification histories specifically to prevent this type of alteration.\n\n5. Alternative ethical options: If legitimate issues with the original preregistration were discovered, ethical alternatives exist:\n   - Document changes transparently in the manuscript\n   - Register a new, amended analysis plan while acknowledging it's post-data collection\n   - Present the originally planned analyses alongside any new ones\n\nThe only scenarios where this could occur without misconduct would be:\n- A genuine misunderstanding about preregistration principles (unlikely for a third-year PhD student)\n- Technical errors in the file system causing incorrect timestamps\n- Accidental uploading of the wrong version of a document that existed before data collection\n\nGiven the nature of preregistration, modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection without explicit disclosure would be highly inconsistent with ethical research practices.\n\nProbability: 10"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would align perfectly with one of the most direct and effective forms of scientific fraud.\n\nThis action would be highly consistent with deliberate misconduct for several reasons:\n\n1. Strategic manipulation: Changing preregistered exclusion criteria after seeing the data allows a researcher to selectively remove participants whose data contradict the desired hypothesis while appearing to follow predetermined rules.\n\n2. Outcome switching: Modifying primary outcomes after data collection is a classic form of HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known), allowing researchers to claim they predicted effects they actually discovered post-hoc.\n\n3. Creating false evidence: A modified preregistration creates a false paper trail suggesting that analytical decisions were made before data collection, which carries much stronger scientific validity than post-hoc decisions.\n\n4. Deliberate concealment: The file timestamps reveal an attempt to conceal the timing of these changes, suggesting awareness that the modifications were inappropriate.\n\n5. Direct contradiction of scientific principles: Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from adjusting analyses after seeing data. Modifying it afterward directly undermines its core purpose and shows intent to circumvent scientific safeguards.\n\nThis form of misconduct is particularly effective because it creates the appearance of methodological rigor while actually engaging in selective analysis. The timestamp evidence makes this especially damning, as it demonstrates not just questionable research practices but deliberate falsification of the research record.\n\nAmong potential indicators of academic misconduct, modifying preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is one of the clearest and most definitive signs of intentional scientific fraud.\n\nProbability: 95"

Lab software changes and hard drive failure (plausible regardless of misconduct)\n2. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria (common in labs focused on robustness)\n3. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions (documented before submission)\n\n**Evidence against misconduct:**\n1. **Clean prior record** with previous studies passing an independent data audit and being rated \"well-documented and reproducible\"\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration document with changed exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection. This directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration and represents a clear violation of research integrity. Combined with the suspicious p-value distribution (a well-established indicator of p-hacking) and the emails revealing motivation for misconduct, there's substantial evidence of problematic research practices.\n\nWhile Lena's previous clean record suggests she knew proper practices, the high-pressure situation described in her emails provides context for why she might have deviated from those standards in this particular study.\n\nTaking all evidence into account, particularly the modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution, which are difficult to explain innocently, the evidence strongly suggests academic misconduct occurred.\n\nProbability: 85"

The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious violation of research ethics. This, combined with the suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05, the pattern of participant exclusions, and her emails expressing the need for positive results, collectively presents compelling evidence of intentional data manipulation. While some factors like her previously clean record provide context, they don't outweigh the strong indicators of misconduct in this specific high-pressure study."
