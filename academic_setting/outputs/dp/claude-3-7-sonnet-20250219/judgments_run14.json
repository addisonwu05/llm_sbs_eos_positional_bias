  "No\n\nWhile there's circumstantial evidence pointing to Alex (the plastic fragments in his trash, his expressed frustration with the printer, and his inconsistent statements), there are also significant factors suggesting he didn't break the printer:\n\n1. Alex couldn't have been physically present when the printer registered its critical error at 5:19 pm, as he badged out at 5:12 pm\n2. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments\n3. Security footage shows Jamie handling the printer roughly before it failed\n4. Alex proactively reported issues with the printer days before it failed\n5. Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment problems\n\nThe timing evidence is particularly compelling - Alex had already left the building when the printer finally failed. While it's possible he damaged it before leaving and it took time to register the error, this creates reasonable doubt. The printer's known defects combined with Jamie's rough handling provide a plausible alternative explanation for the failure."
