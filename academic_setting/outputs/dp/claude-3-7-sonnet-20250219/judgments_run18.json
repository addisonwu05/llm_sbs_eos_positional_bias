  "No\n\nBased on the evidence presented, I cannot conclude that Alex broke the printer beyond reasonable doubt. The timing discrepancy (Alex leaving the building at 5:12pm while the printer error occurred at 5:19pm) provides a significant alibi. Additionally, the printer model has a documented history of failing due to defective fuser units, and security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier. While there is suspicious evidence like the plastic fragments and Alex's contradictory statements, these could have alternative explanations, and the physical timeline makes it difficult to definitively attribute the damage to Alex."
