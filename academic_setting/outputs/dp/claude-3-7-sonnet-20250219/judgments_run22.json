  "Yes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nBased on the evidence presented, there are several critical indicators that strongly suggest misconduct. The most damning evidence includes the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, the statistically suspicious distribution of p-values clustered just below .05, and the pattern of participant exclusions between early and final analyses. These methodological issues are accompanied by clear evidence of motive and pressure in Lena's emails.\n\nWhile some contextual factors like software changes and her previously good record provide some counterbalance, they don't adequately explain the specific pattern of problematic research practices observed in this study. The totality of evidence points to deliberate manipulation of analyses and data to achieve desired significant results rather than honest errors or coincidences."
