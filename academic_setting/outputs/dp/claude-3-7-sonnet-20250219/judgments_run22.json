  "Based on the evidence presented, I cannot definitively state whether Alex broke the printer with complete certainty. The evidence contains both incriminating elements (plastic fragments in Alex's trash, inconsistent statements, proximity to the printer shortly before failure) and exculpatory factors (Alex's prior reporting of issues, the printer's documented history of similar failures, Jamie's rough handling of the printer, Alex's absence when the failure occurred).\n\nGiven the balance of evidence and the reasonable doubt that exists due to the printer model's known defects and alternative explanations, I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to conclusively determine that Alex broke the printer.\n\nNo"
