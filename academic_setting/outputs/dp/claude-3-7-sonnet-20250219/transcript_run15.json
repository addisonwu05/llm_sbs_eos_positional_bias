The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This could be her first instance of misconduct, with all previous work being honest and proper. Researchers sometimes face increasing pressure over time, and someone with previously honest work might succumb to misconduct later in their career.\n\n2. She may have committed misconduct before but was sophisticated enough to avoid detection during the audit.

She could have varying standards across different projects - being careful with some studies but cutting corners on others depending on circumstances like pressure, oversight, or personal investment.\n\nSeveral factors make the first scenario plausible:\n- As a third-year PhD student, the current study may represent higher stakes than her previous work\n- Her supervisor is mentioned as being under pressure for the current study\n- The whistleblower specifically targeted this study, not her entire body of work\n- Audits can be reasonably thorough at detecting many forms of data problems\n\nHowever, research also suggests that misconduct rarely occurs as a one-time event. If someone crosses ethical lines once, they may have done so before, perhaps starting with minor infractions that escalated over time.\n\nThe fact that her previous work was specifically rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" creates tension with the hypothesis that she committed misconduct in those studies.

Robustness testing: The scenario explicitly mentions a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" Testing whether results hold under different analytical decisions is considered good scientific practice, especially in fields like cognitive neuroscience where researcher degrees of freedom are a concern.\n\n2. Exploratory analysis: Researchers often try different approaches during exploratory phases before finalizing their confirmatory analyses.\n\n3. Learning process: As a PhD student, Lena may be developing her analytical skills and trying different approaches as part of her training.\n\n4. Evolving analysis plan: Analyses often evolve as researchers better understand their data, encounter unexpected patterns, or respond to feedback.\n\n5. Lab standard practice: The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" suggests this is normative behavior within the research group.\n\nThe presence of multiple scripts with different exclusion criteria is actually consistent with transparent, thorough scientific practice when properly documented and reported.

Cover for p-hacking: Having multiple scripts could provide plausible deniability for selective reporting. If she tried different analyses until finding significant results, having these explorations appear to be part of a lab-wide robustness initiative would help disguise this questionable research practice.\n\n2. Conforming to lab norms: Even while committing misconduct, Lena would likely try to maintain appearances by following standard lab practices. Since other students have similar patterns of scripts, not having these would make her stand out suspiciously.\n\n3. Gradual progression to misconduct: She may have started with legitimate robustness analyses before deciding to misrepresent the results or manipulate the data. The early scripts could be genuine exploration before misconduct occurred.\n\n4. Mixture of legitimate and illegitimate work: Some of her alternative analyses might be legitimate while others contain the misconduct.\n\n5. Evidence hiding: Having multiple versions creates confusion about which is the \"real\" analysis, potentially obscuring evidence of misconduct.\n\nThe key point is that the presence of multiple analysis scripts is fully compatible with both honest research practices and with misconduct. Having these scripts doesn't exonerate Lena, as misconduct could occur in how she selected, reported, or modified these analyses, rather than in whether she explored alternatives.\n\nIn a lab where running multiple analyses is the norm, someone committing misconduct would almost certainly maintain this pattern to avoid standing out. The misconduct would likely manifest in how the results from these analyses were ultimately selected and reported, not in whether alternative analyses existed.\n\nGiven the lab culture and the behavior of other students, if Lena did commit misconduct, it's still highly likely these multiple analysis scripts would be present in her logs.\n\n85"

The hard drive failure was confirmed by an independent department.

The timing of the modifications (after data collection) combined with the nature of the changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - both elements that directly affect statistical significance) makes this particularly problematic.\n\nEven without malicious intent, this represents at minimum a serious methodological error that violates core principles of confirmatory research. If Lena was conducting research with proper understanding of scientific methods and integrity, this should not have occurred.\n\nGiven the fundamental purpose of preregistration and the specific changes made, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of this occurring would be very low.\n\n10"

Strategic outcome manipulation:\n   - Changing primary outcomes after seeing which measures showed significant results\n   - Altering exclusion criteria to selectively remove participants whose data weakens the desired effect\n   - Retrofitting the preregistration to match the analysis that produced the strongest findings\n\n2. Covering tracks of p-hacking:\n   - Making the final analyses appear to have been planned from the beginning\n   - Creating the false impression that significant results emerged from confirmatory rather than exploratory analyses\n   - Hiding the fact that multiple analyses were tried until favorable results emerged\n\n3. Publication strategy:\n   - Avoiding having to report deviations from the preregistration in the paper\n   - Preventing reviewers from questioning changes to the analysis plan\n   - Making results appear more convincing by suggesting they were predicted a priori\n\n4. Intentional misrepresentation:\n   - Creating a false paper trail suggesting methodological decisions were made before seeing the data\n   - Deliberately circumventing the scientific safeguards preregistration is designed to provide\n\nThis type of modification directly contradicts the entire purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analytical decisions before data collection to prevent researcher degrees of freedom from being exploited. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are particularly problematic as these are key factors that influence statistical significance.\n\nThe specific timing (after data collection) suggests these modifications were made with knowledge of which changes would benefit the results. The fact that file timestamps provide objective evidence of this timing makes this particularly consistent with deliberate misconduct rather than confusion or error.\n\nThis practice is widely recognized as a serious breach of research integrity, as it fundamentally undermines the scientific method by blurring the line between prediction and postdiction.\n\nGiven that this behavior directly serves the purpose of making p-hacked or manipulated results appear legitimate, if Lena did commit misconduct, the probability of seeing this evidence would be very high.\n\n95"

Her supervisor is \"counting on this study to save the grant\"\n2. \"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" \n3. \"I need this one to work\"\n\nThese statements reflect the very real pressures that exist in academic research, particularly for PhD students:\n\n1. Career pressure context:\n   - PhD students often feel intense pressure to produce positive results\n   - The academic job market places heavy emphasis on publications\n   - Competition for postdoc positions is fierce, especially in neuroscience\n   - These are genuine concerns that many honest researchers experience\n\n2. Grant funding realities:\n   - Principal investigators do often depend on positive results for grant renewals\n   - This creates structural pressure that affects labs regardless of research integrity\n   - Lena's assessment of her supervisor's needs may be accurate, not indicative of fraud\n\n3. Psychological expression:\n   - Venting to a friend is a common coping mechanism for stress\n   - Private expressions of anxiety don't necessarily translate to unethical actions\n   - Many researchers feel pressure while still maintaining ethical boundaries\n\n4. Ambiguity in \"need this to work\":\n   - Could mean \"need to find significant results regardless of data\" (suggesting misconduct)\n   - Could also mean \"need to execute this study well and hope for the best\" (consistent with integrity)\n   - Could express hope rather than intention to manipulate\n\nThese statements reveal the problematic incentive structures in academia that affect all researchers. Many honest scientists feel these exact pressures but respond by working harder and being more careful with their methods, rather than committing fraud.\n\nThe emails demonstrate awareness of career incentives and express anxiety, but do not necessarily indicate willingness to compromise research integrity. Many researchers privately acknowledge these pressures while still conducting honest science.\n\nGiven how common these sentiments are in academia, especially among PhD students, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of her writing such emails would still be fairly high.\n\n70"

Motive establishment:\n   - The emails directly articulate the pressures and incentives that could motivate fraud\n   - They establish clear personal and professional stakes in obtaining positive results\n   - The language suggests desperation that could lead to crossing ethical lines\n\n2. Psychological indicators:\n   - \"I need this one to work\" demonstrates outcome fixation rather than process integrity\n   - The focus on results rather than scientific accuracy suggests a problematic mindset\n   - This reveals prioritizing career advancement over methodological rigor\n\n3. Risk factors for misconduct:\n   - Perceived career dependency on positive outcomes\n   - External pressure from authority figures (supervisor)\n   - Financial/resource pressures (grant funding)\n   - These are all recognized risk factors in research misconduct cases\n\n4.

Consistency with fraud psychology:\n   - Most academic misconduct occurs not because researchers are inherently unethical but because they face perceived insurmountable pressures\n   - These emails articulate exactly those pressures\n   - The rationalization process often begins with statements like \"I need this to work\"\n\nThese emails articulate precisely the psychological and situational factors that lead to research misconduct. They demonstrate awareness of the consequences of null results and express an outcome-focused rather than process-focused mindset.\n\nThe combination of supervisor pressure, career concerns, and personal investment creates what research ethics literature calls a \"perfect storm\" for misconduct. The specific phrase \"need this one to work\" is particularly revealing of a results-oriented mindset that prioritizes outcomes over methodological integrity.\n\nGiven that these statements perfectly align with the typical motivational pattern preceding research misconduct, if Lena did commit academic fraud, the probability of her having written these emails would be very high.\n\n95"

    "content": "To determine the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I'll analyze the key evidence presented and evaluate its implications.\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. P-value distribution: The dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above. This pattern is a well-established statistical signature of p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\n2. Modified preregistration: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and strongly suggests results-driven analysis decisions.\n\n3. Email statements: Lena expressed strong outcome-oriented motivations, stating she \"needs this one to work\" and connecting the study's success to her postdoc chances and her supervisor's grant.\n\n4. Participant exclusions: Earlier analysis scripts included more participants who were later excluded, consistent with selective removal to strengthen results.\n\nAmbiguous evidence:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts: The presence of multiple analytical approaches is consistent with both thorough exploratory research and p-hacking, though the lab-wide practice provides some context.\n\n2. Software change and hard drive failure: These events could either be unfortunate coincidences or convenient explanations for missing files and data inconsistencies.\n\n3. Participant exclusion documentation: The notes about participants falling asleep predate submission, which could indicate either proper documentation or careful covering of tracks.\n\nEvidence suggesting integrity:\n\n1. Previous audit success: Lena's earlier work was rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" in an independent audit.\n\nWeighing the evidence holistically:\n\nThe most damning evidence is the combination of:\n- The statistical anomaly of p-values clustering just below significance\n- The modification of preregistration after data collection\n- The documented motivational pressure in the emails\n- The pattern of participant exclusion between script versions\n\nWhile some evidence is ambiguous, the strongest indicators point toward misconduct. The p-value distribution and modified preregistration are particularly concerning as they are objectively verified and difficult to explain innocently.\n\nConsidering all evidence presented, I assess that there is a high probability Lena committed some form of academic misconduct.\n\n85"
