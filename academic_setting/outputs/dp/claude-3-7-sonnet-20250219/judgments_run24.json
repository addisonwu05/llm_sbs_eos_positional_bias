  "Based on the evidence presented, my assessment is:\n\nYes\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates academic misconduct. The most compelling factors include: modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes; the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above; documented changes in participant inclusion between early and final analyses; and explicit statements in emails about needing positive results. While there are some mitigating factors like her previously strong record, the technical issues with software and hard drive failure could have been opportunistically used to obscure evidence of manipulation. The pattern of evidence collectively points to intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired significant results rather than honest reporting of findings."
