  "No\n\nBased on careful analysis of the evidence, I believe Alex did not break the printer. The timing evidence is particularly important - badge records showing Alex left at 5:12pm while the printer failed at 5:19pm create a significant alibi. Additionally, Alex had a history of responsibly reporting equipment issues, including warning about the printer's grinding noise days earlier. The printer model had a documented history of similar failures, and another employee (Jamie) was seen handling it roughly. While some evidence like the plastic fragments is concerning, it wasn't confirmed as an exact match, and when all evidence is considered together, there appears to be reasonable doubt about Alex's responsibility for the printer failure."
