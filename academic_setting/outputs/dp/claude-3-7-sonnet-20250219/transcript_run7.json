The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Data from participants who misunderstood instructions wouldn't reflect the cognitive processes being studied.\n\nThese are legitimate reasons for exclusion that preserve data quality and are typically documented in pre-registered exclusion criteria or established methodological norms.\n\nThe fact that these exclusions were documented in raw data files that predate the journal submission is particularly important.

The decision to exclude these participants wasn't made retroactively to improve results after seeing the full dataset or in response to reviewer feedback.\n\nThis type of contemporaneous documentation is exactly what researchers should do when making participant exclusions, and it aligns with good scientific practice.\n\nIn a study with 80 participants, having two participants (2.5%) experience such issues is quite reasonable and perhaps even lower than might be expected in cognitive neuroscience experiments, which often involve repetitive or demanding tasks where attention lapses or confusion can occur.\n\nGiven all these factors, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is very likely that she would have properly excluded these two participants based on legitimate scientific reasons and documented this appropriately before submission.\n\n90"

The exclusions could be legitimate even if other aspects of the study involved misconduct. Researchers who engage in misconduct may still follow proper protocols in some areas of their work. The exclusion of participants who fall asleep or misunderstand instructions is standard practice, and Lena might have properly documented these particular exclusions even if she committed other forms of misconduct elsewhere.\n\n2. The exclusion notes that \"predate journal submission\" could potentially be falsified or backdated if Lena was systematically manipulating the research record. However, this would require additional deception beyond the data manipulation itself.\n\n3. If Lena was engaging in p-hacking or selective reporting, she might have used legitimate exclusion criteria but applied them inconsistently to achieve desired results. However, the scenario specifically mentions that the exclusion notes were in the raw data files and predate submission, which suggests these particular exclusions weren't post-hoc.\n\n4. Even researchers engaging in misconduct would have rational reasons to exclude participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, as including such obviously compromised data could raise red flags during review.\n\nGiven that excluding 2 out of 80 participants (2.5%) for these reasons is reasonable and wouldn't necessarily be suspicious in cognitive neuroscience research, and that contemporaneous documentation exists, these particular exclusions could still be legitimate even if other aspects of the research involved misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, the likelihood that these specific exclusions were properly documented before submission is still moderately high.\n\n65"

This is becoming standard practice in cognitive neuroscience to address concerns about reproducibility.\n\n2. **Similar patterns across students**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts strongly suggests this is a lab policy or norm rather than individual behavior specific to Lena.\n\n3. **Methodological thoroughness**: In cognitive neuroscience, researchers often run multiple versions of analyses with different exclusion criteria to understand how sensitive their results are to these decisions. This helps establish which findings are robust and which might be artifacts of particular analytical choices.\n\n4. **Exploratory analysis**: During data analysis, researchers typically explore various approaches before settling on a final analysis strategy. Storing these exploratory scripts is good practice for transparency and documentation.\n\n5. **Learning process**: As a PhD student, Lena would be expected to explore different analytical approaches as part of her training.\n\n6. **Transparent documentation**: The fact that these alternative analyses were logged in the lab's data management system indicates openness rather than concealment, which aligns with ethical research practices.\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be not only unsuspicious but actually indicative of thorough, transparent scientific practice, especially given the lab-wide context and similar behavior from other students.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern of multiple analysis scripts would be highly likely to appear in the lab's data management logs.\n\n95"

She could try many approaches and only report the ones yielding significant results, while appearing to follow the lab's robustness protocols.\n\n2. **Lab culture conformity**: Since other students show similar patterns, Lena would likely follow the same practices to avoid standing out. Deviating from lab norms might raise suspicion, so maintaining the appearance of similar analytical approaches would be strategic.\n\n3. **Plausible deniability**: Having multiple analysis scripts documented provides plausible deniability if questioned about analytical decisions. She could claim to be following the lab's robustness practices while actually selecting favorable outcomes.\n\n4. **Actual exploratory analyses alongside misconduct**: Misconduct doesn't necessarily mean all aspects of research were fraudulent. Lena might have genuinely explored different exclusion criteria before deciding where to introduce fabrication or manipulation.\n\n5. **Specific manipulation**: The misconduct might be limited to specific aspects of the data or analysis that wouldn't be obvious from the existence of multiple scripts - such as manipulating raw data files while keeping analysis scripts legitimate.\n\n6. **Lab-wide initiative**: Since this was a \"lab-wide push,\" Lena would likely be expected to participate and would have her work monitored by her supervisor, making compliance with this particular practice likely regardless of misconduct elsewhere.\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts is compatible with both ethical research practices and certain forms of misconduct.

This is particularly relevant given the unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 mentioned previously.\n\n4. **Hidden exploratory analyses**: The earlier script could represent genuine exploratory analyses that were later presented as confirmatory, with participants selectively removed to strengthen the findings.\n\n5. **Undisclosed analytical flexibility**: Trying multiple exclusion approaches but only reporting the \"successful\" one is a common form of misconduct. The automated backup would reveal this undisclosed analytical flexibility.\n\n6. **Intentional script versioning**: If committing misconduct, Lena would likely maintain multiple versions of analyses, keeping the ones that \"worked\" and discarding others. The automated backup would have captured versions that might otherwise have been deleted.\n\n7. **Consistency with other evidence**: This finding aligns with the suspicious p-value distribution mentioned earlier, as participant exclusion is one of the primary mechanisms for p-hacking.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants, recovered from an automated backup rather than provided voluntarily, is precisely the kind of evidence we would expect to find if data manipulation had occurred. It would reveal the \"behind the scenes\" analytical process that led to the suspiciously favorable final results.\n\n95"

    "content": "This scenario involves modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. If Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to evaluate how likely such modifications would be.\n\nPreregistration is specifically designed to prevent researchers from making these kinds of post-hoc changes, as they fundamentally undermine the purpose of preregistration. The core principles of preregistration include:\n\n1. **Time-locked commitment**: Preregistrations must be finalized before data collection to prevent researchers from adjusting hypotheses or analyses based on observed results.\n\n2. **Transparency about changes**: If legitimate modifications are needed, proper procedure requires transparently documenting these as deviations from the preregistration, not changing the original document.\n\n3. **Immutability of primary outcomes**: Changing primary outcomes after seeing the data is particularly problematic as it enables researchers to selectively promote favorable results.\n\nFor these modifications to occur without constituting misconduct, the circumstances would need to be highly unusual:\n\n- Perhaps there was a legitimate administrative error in the original filing that required correction\n- There might have been a misunderstanding about preregistration procedures\n- Technical issues might have necessitated changes that should have been documented transparently elsewhere\n\nHowever, making undisclosed changes to both exclusion criteria AND primary outcomes after data collection strongly suggests intentional manipulation of the analysis plan to achieve desired results. This directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration.\n\nEven with the most charitable interpretation, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change these key elements would represent, at minimum, a serious violation of research practices that ensure scientific integrity. If Lena did not intend misconduct, this would represent an extremely serious procedural error that undermines research validity.\n\n15"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be extremely likely for several key reasons:\n\n1. **Strategic outcome manipulation**: Changing primary outcomes after seeing the data is a powerful way to convert unsuccessful results into successful ones. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration would allow her to highlight only the measures that showed significant effects while disguising this as planned analysis.\n\n2. **Exclusion criteria adjustment**: Modifying exclusion criteria after seeing the data would enable Lena to selectively remove participants whose data weakened the desired results. This aligns with the earlier finding of participants being excluded between earlier and final analyses.\n\n3. **Creating a false paper trail**: If committing misconduct, Lena would need documentation that appears to legitimize her analytical choices. Modifying the preregistration creates the false impression that her final analyses were planned before data collection.\n\n4. **Consistency with p-hacking evidence**: The unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 is exactly what we would expect to see after someone has adjusted analyses and exclusion criteria to achieve significance. Modifying the preregistration would be part of covering up this process.\n\n5. **Addressing vulnerability**: The original preregistration would represent a significant vulnerability if it contradicted the reported analyses. Modifying it would be a logical step to reduce the risk of detection.\n\n6. **Comprehensive deception**: If Lena was fabricating or manipulating results, simply changing analyses without updating the preregistration would create an obvious discrepancy between planned and reported analyses. Modifying the preregistration document would be necessary to maintain consistency in the deception.\n\nThe timestamp evidence is particularly damning as it provides objective documentation of the timeline of changes relative to data collection. This type of modification directly undermines the entire purpose of preregistration and represents a deliberate attempt to circumvent scientific safeguards designed to prevent precisely this type of misconduct.\n\n95"

This is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking and is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: File timestamps indicate the preregistration was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a serious violation of research integrity.\n\n3. **Pattern of participant exclusion**: An earlier analysis script included participants who were later excluded. This pattern is consistent with selective data manipulation.\n\n4. **Motivational evidence**: Lena's emails express strong career pressure and necessity for significant results, establishing clear motive.\n\n**Evidence potentially consistent with innocence:**\n\n1. **Clean prior record**: Lena's previous work passed independent audits and was rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\n2. **Lab context**: Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative, with other students showing similar patterns.\n\n3. **Technical issues**: The lab switched statistical software mid-project, and Lena experienced a confirmed hard drive failure with IT documentation.\n\n4. **Legitimate exclusions**: Two participants were excluded based on notes predating journal submission.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe most damning evidence is the combination of:\n- Modified preregistration after data collection\n- Statistically anomalous p-value distribution just below .05\n- Evidence of progressive participant exclusion from earlier to final analyses\n\nThese three elements together form a coherent pattern of misconduct that is difficult to explain through innocent means. The p-value distribution in particular is a well-documented statistical signature of data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's prior clean record and some legitimate context exists, the specific pattern of evidence strongly points toward intentional manipulation of analyses and results to achieve desired significance.\n\n90"
