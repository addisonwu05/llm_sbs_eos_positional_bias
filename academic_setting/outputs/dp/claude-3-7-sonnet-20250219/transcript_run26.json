The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Someone intending to manipulate results could run numerous analyses and selectively report only those yielding desired outcomes while disguising this as \"robustness testing.\"\n\n2. Since other lab members have similar patterns of multiple scripts, this provides excellent camouflage.

The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" creates a legitimate framework within which questionable research practices could be hidden.

If misconduct occurred, having multiple scripts with varying criteria would be strategically advantageous - it allows exploration of which exclusion criteria produce the strongest results.\n\n5. In cases of misconduct, researchers often engage in practices that superficially resemble legitimate methods. Running multiple analyses that appear methodologically sound on the surface but are selectively implemented is a common form of data manipulation.\n\n6. The whistleblower specifically mentioned analyses being \"changed after reviewers' comments,\" suggesting potential flexibility in analytical approaches.\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts is entirely consistent with both legitimate research practices AND potential misconduct - it's the selective reporting and decision-making about which analyses to present that would constitute misconduct, not the existence of multiple scripts themselves.\n\nProbability: 85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be extremely consistent with deliberate research manipulation.\n\nThis behavior represents a textbook case of scientific misconduct for several reasons:\n\n1. Strategic circumvention of safeguards: Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from adjusting analyses after seeing results. Modifying it after data collection directly undermines this core scientific safeguard.\n\n2. Results-driven changes: Modifying exclusion criteria after seeing the data allows a researcher to selectively include/exclude participants to achieve desired outcomes. Similarly, changing primary outcomes enables focusing on whichever measures showed the most favorable results.\n\n3. Creating false documentation: By altering the preregistration rather than filing a transparent amendment, this creates a false paper trail suggesting these decisions were made before data collection.\n\n4. Alignment with other evidence: This connects directly to other suspicious patterns in the case - the unusual p-value distributions, participant exclusions, and multiple analysis scripts.\n\n5. Deliberate nature: Unlike some questionable research practices that might occur through carelessness, modifying a preregistration document requires intentional action with awareness of its significance.\n\n6. Technical sophistication: The fact that file timestamps still revealed the modifications suggests Lena may not have realized these would be preserved, indicating deliberate intent to conceal the changes.\n\nThis type of tampering with preregistration is considered one of the most serious forms of analytical misconduct because it undermines the very mechanisms designed to ensure research integrity. It represents a deliberate attempt to present post-hoc decisions as if they were pre-planned, which is fundamentally deceptive.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "After examining all the evidence presented, I need to weigh factors that suggest misconduct against those that could have innocent explanations.\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. The unusual distribution of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking and extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes fundamentally undermines research integrity and indicates deliberate manipulation.\n\n3. The pattern of excluding participants from the final dataset who were present in earlier analysis scripts suggests potential selective removal to improve results.\n\n4. The emails expressing pressure about needing the study to \"work\" establish clear motivation, though this alone doesn't prove misconduct.\n\nMitigating factors or ambiguous evidence:\n\n1. Lena's previous clean record with \"well-documented and reproducible\" work suggests established good practices, though this doesn't preclude later misconduct.\n\n2. The software change and hard drive failure are documented events that could legitimately explain some inconsistencies.\n\n3. The multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria could reflect either proper robustness testing (as was the lab culture) or p-hacking opportunities.\n\n4. The excluded participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions were documented before submission, which is consistent with proper procedure.\n\nThe most damning evidence is the combination of p-values clustered just below significance, modified preregistration after data collection, and selective participant exclusion. These specific patterns are difficult to explain through chance or legitimate research practices.\n\nWeighing all factors, the evidence strongly suggests intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nProbability: 85"
