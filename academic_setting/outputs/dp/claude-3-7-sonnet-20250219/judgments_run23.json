  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe there is substantial evidence pointing to Alex's involvement, but also significant counterevidence and alternative explanations. While the physical evidence (plastic fragments in Alex's trash) and behavioral evidence (frustration, proximity to the printer before failure) suggest Alex's involvement, the timing discrepancy (Alex leaving before the failure), prior reporting of issues, and the printer's documented history of similar failures create reasonable doubt.\n\nGiven the conflicting evidence and the principle that conclusions should be drawn only when evidence clearly supports them, I cannot confidently state that Alex broke the printer.\n\nNo"
