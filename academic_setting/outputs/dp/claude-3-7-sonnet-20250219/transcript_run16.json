The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate whether Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to carefully weigh all the evidence presented.\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n- Preregistration document was modified after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (very strong evidence)\n- Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 (very strong statistical evidence)\n- Earlier analysis scripts included participants who were later excluded (concerning in context)\n- Emails expressing pressure about needing the study to \"work\" for her career and grant funding (motivation)\n\nEvidence suggesting innocence or mitigating factors:\n- Previously passed independent data audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" rating\n- Lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses to test robustness, similar to other students\n- Documented legitimate exclusions (sleeping participants) with notes predating submission\n- Confirmed hardware failure and software switch that could explain some irregularities\n\nThe most damning evidence comes from the objective indicators:\n1. Modifying preregistration after data collection directly undermines scientific integrity\n2. The p-value distribution shows a statistically implausible pattern that strongly suggests p-hacking\n3. The combination of changed preregistration criteria and participant exclusions forms a consistent pattern\n\nWhile Lena's prior good record is notable, the specific evidence in this case shows multiple objective indicators of misconduct. The modified preregistration alone is difficult to explain innocently, and when combined with the suspicious p-value distribution and selective participant exclusion, the pattern becomes quite clear.\n\nThe evidence suggests Lena likely responded to pressure by engaging in questionable research practices or outright misconduct in this specific high-stakes study, despite her previous good record.\n\n85"
