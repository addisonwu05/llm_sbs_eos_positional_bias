  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe timeline evidence strongly supports Alex's innocence - he badged out of the building at 5:12pm while the printer error occurred at 5:19pm, making it physically impossible for Alex to have caused the final failure. Additionally, this printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling, and security footage shows another employee (Jamie) roughly handling the printer earlier that afternoon.\n\nWhile there are some concerning elements like Alex's expressed frustration and the plastic fragments in his trash, these can be explained by coincidence or normal office interactions with a malfunctioning printer. Alex's proactive email about the printer's grinding noise days before the breakdown also demonstrates responsible behavior rather than someone planning to damage equipment.\n\nThe weight of evidence, particularly the objective timeline and documented printer defects, points toward Alex not being responsible for breaking the printer."
