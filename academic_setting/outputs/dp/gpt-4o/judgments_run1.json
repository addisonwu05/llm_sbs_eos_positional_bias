  "Based on the evidence provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. However, considering the convergence of suspicious indicators, such as the modification of preregistration documents after data collection, the suspicious pattern of p-values, and the strong pressures identified in her communications, there is a significant concern. That said, the final determination should be made by a formal inquiry with access to more detailed evidence and context.\n\nSo, while the evidence raises suspicion, it is not sufficient alone to definitively say \"Yes,\" Lena committed academic misconduct without further investigation.\n\nFinal answer: No (pending further investigation for a definitive conclusion)."
