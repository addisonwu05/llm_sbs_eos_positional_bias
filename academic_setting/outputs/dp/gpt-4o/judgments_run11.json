  "Given the available information and indicators, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct without further investigation or evidence. The presence of certain factors, such as the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the pattern of p-values, raises suspicion. However, these need to be corroborated with intent and context that are difficult to fully ascertain from this summary alone. Thus, determining whether misconduct definitely occurred requires a more thorough examination by an official inquiry or relevant academic body. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is not conclusively Yes or No."
