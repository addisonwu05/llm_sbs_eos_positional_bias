The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The likelihood of a lab switching statistical software during a project and experiencing a hard drive failure with data loss can depend on several factors. Let's consider them:\n\n1. **Switching Software:**\n   - **Research Needs:** Labs occasionally switch software if new tools provide better features, are more user-friendly, or align with updated methodologies. If the new software offers significant advantages for data analysis or visualization, a switch might be warranted even mid-project.\n   - **Institutional Decisions:** Sometimes software decisions are made at a higher administrative level and researchers need to adapt. This might occur due to licensing issues, organizational policies, or cost considerations.\n   - **Training and Transition:** Switching software typically involves a transition phase with potential challenges, including differences in syntax, functionality, and data handling. This can explain inconsistencies during analysis.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure:**\n   - **Technology Reliability:** While modern laptops are generally reliable, hard drive failures, though less frequent than in the past, do occur. This can be due to hardware defects, physical damage, or wear and tear over time.\n   - **Data Management Practices:** The impact of a hard drive failure could be mitigated by regular backups, but if backups were not routine, data loss could pose a significant issue. Organizations frequently remind staff to back up data, but compliance varies.\n\nGiven these considerations, switching software and experiencing a hard drive failure are not implausible in a research setting. Both events can occur independently for legitimate reasons, especially in high-intensity research environments where technical demands evolve rapidly and devices are frequently in use.\n\nThus, while these events together might raise some eyebrows, they are not inherently indicative of misconduct if supported by independent verification, such as IT department confirmation of the hardware failure.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40"

However, an intent to deceive via these events would not inherently increase their likelihood, but they could appear to be overly coincidental when supporting an allegation of misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, while the events are not impossible if misconduct occurred, they would be seen as more convenient rather than more likely to happen in such a scenario.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30"

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 could suggest p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n2. **Exploratory Analyses:**\n   - Exploratory analyses should ideally reflect a wide range of p-values, as they involve testing multiple hypotheses and varying parameters.
