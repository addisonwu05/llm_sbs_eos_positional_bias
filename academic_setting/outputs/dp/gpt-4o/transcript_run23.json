The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The information from the lab's data management logs that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with different exclusion criteria, can be indicative of standard scientific practice, particularly when exploring the robustness and reliability of research findings. Running various analyses to test how sensitive results are to different choices is a common and often encouraged practice in research, especially in fields like cognitive neuroscience where data can be complex and variable.\n\n1. **Scientific Norms and Practices:** It is common for researchers to explore multiple analytical avenues to ensure their findings are robust. The practice of running and storing multiple analysis scripts aligns with efforts to identify how results might vary based on different analytical choices. This procedure is often used to determine the robustness and reliability of research outcomes.\n\n2. **Lab Culture:** The fact that other students in the lab exhibit similar patterns suggests a lab-wide culture or directive focusing on robustness checks. Labs often engage in collectively exploring different analysis pathways, especially when pressured to ensure findings are defendable under scrutiny. This context can help explain why Lena's data analysis approach followed this pattern.\n\n3. **Software Transition:** The transition to new software could plausibly lead to running multiple analysis scripts, as learning curves and adjustments to new tools may necessitate testing different methods to achieve reliable results.\n\n4. **No Direct Evidence of Misconduct:** The existence of multiple scripts is not direct evidence of misconduct, but rather, it could simply be indicative of thorough scientific exploration and methodological rigor.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that the lab's data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying criteria, especially if this practice is consistent with lab norms and is seen in other students’ work as well.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 90"

This could serve as a cover for selectively reporting only those results that best support the hypothesis, which might mask any manipulations made to achieve favorable outcomes.\n\n2. **Trial and Error Approach:** In a situation where a researcher is trying to ensure results appear significant, they might experiment with various exclusion criteria and alternative analysis scripts to see what combination yields the \"best\" or most statistically significant outcomes. \n\n3. **Intent to Mislead:** Misconduct can sometimes involve creating a façade of thoroughness. Storing multiple alternatives might be a way to defend the integrity of the results if they are questioned, claiming that all options were explored, but only the most 'appropriate' or 'valid' analyses were reported.\n\n4. **Culture as Cover:** The similarity to other students' practices could provide convenient camouflage; if all labs share the same script-running practices, Lena's actions may seem routine rather than suspicious, potentially hiding any misconduct.\n\nDespite these points, the presence of multiple analysis scripts alone is not definitive evidence of misconduct.

Documenting such occurrences helps ensure the integrity of the dataset by identifying data that may be invalid due to participant non-compliance.\n\n2. **Rationale for Exclusion:** Excluding participants who fell asleep or did not understand the instructions is consistent with maintaining data quality. Such exclusions are typically justified to ensure that the analyses reflect genuine task performance, rather than noise introduced by participants who did not engage with the task as intended.\n\n3. **Proactive Documentation:** The existence of notes predating the journal submission indicates a proactive approach to data handling. It suggests that Lena was attentive to the data quality from the outset, which is consistent with rigorous and honest research practices.\n\n4. **Consistency with Ethical Norms:** Researchers are ethically bound to report data that accurately represent their findings. Proactively excluding problematic data based on contemporaneous notes aligns with ethical guidelines, which require transparency and accuracy.\n\nOverall, the exclusion of these participants based on pre-existing notes in the raw data files strongly aligns with standard, ethical research practices and suggests due diligence rather than misconduct.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

This could be part of a strategy to ensure any data manipulation remained concealed within seemingly legitimate data processing practices.\n\n2. **Forethought:** If Lena had the foresight to plan the data fabrication or manipulation strategically, she might have ensured that the documentation appeared thorough and consistent with standard research practices. By making notes in advance, it would give a semblance of legitimatizing subsequent exclusions.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks:** Predating notes can serve as a way to cover tracks and lend credibility to the dataset as being handled properly, even if the intention was to manipulate outcomes. This approach could be part of creating a facade of normalcy and adhering to expected scientific rigor while engaging in misconduct.\n\n4. **Common Practice:** Regardless of misconduct, excluding data from participants who were non-compliant (e.g., falling asleep, not understanding instructions) is a typical research practice and would be difficult to critique, potentially allowing Lena to argue convincingly for their exclusion.\n\nGiven these points, even if Lena committed misconduct, it remains plausible that participants with valid exclusion reasons would be documented prior to submission, both to maintain a veneer of rigorous data management and to make any potential exclusion seem routine.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 80"

Lena might have adhered to proper protocols in earlier studies but deviated in the current project due to external pressures or different circumstances, allowing her past work to legitimately pass an audit.\n\n2. **Isolated Incident:** If misconduct is a recent development prompted by unique pressures (e.g., the urgency of producing results), her past work could still reflect genuine and careful data practices.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we must consider the totality of evidence:\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns of P-values:** The clustering of p-values just below .05 is a significant red flag often associated with p-hacking or selective reporting, both indicative of data manipulation.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration:** Altering a preregistration document after data collection, especially changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is highly suggestive of misconduct aimed at reshaping the study narrative post hoc to achieve favorable results.\n\n3. **Expressions of Pressure:** Lena's emails reveal extreme pressure to produce positive results, which might indicate a motive for compromising research integrity, but alone don't confirm misconduct.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies and Potential Misuse:** The sequence of events, including the lost files and modifications found in scripts, could be the result of honest mistakes; however, they could also provide convenient cover for manipulation, especially when considered alongside deliberate actions like changing preregistration.\n\n5. **Reputation and Past Conduct:** Lena's prior record of careful data management and passing audits is a point against misconduct, suggesting that, if it occurred, it might be an isolated incident driven by current pressures.\n\nOverall, while no single piece of evidence completely confirms misconduct, the combination of suspicious data patterns, documented changes post hoc, and explicit high-pressure communications increases the probability beyond mere chance or coincidence.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 85"

However, without definitive proof or a comprehensive investigation outcome, a conclusive judgment cannot be fully determined here.\n\nBased on the information available and the probabilities discussed, the assessment leans towards **Yes**, suggesting that it is likely Lena committed academic misconduct."
