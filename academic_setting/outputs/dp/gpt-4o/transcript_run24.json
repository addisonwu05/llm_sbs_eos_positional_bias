The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The exclusion of participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions appears to be a reasonable and standard practice in cognitive neuroscience research. Researchers often exclude data from participants who do not adequately engage with the task, as their data may not be reliable or valid for the intended analysis. The presence of notes in the raw data files that predate the journal submission suggests that these decisions were made based on pre-established criteria rather than an attempt to manipulate the dataset post hoc to achieve the desired results.\n\nThere are several reasons why this exclusion would not be considered suspicious:\n\n1. **Standard Protocol**: Excluding participants who did not properly follow instructions or who were not fully alert is a common practice. These participants' data are unlikely to meaningfully contribute to the research findings and may introduce noise.\n\n2. **Documentation**: The notes in the raw data files document the reason for exclusion, which is part of maintaining transparency and integrity in research.\n\n3. **Timing**: The fact that these notes predate any journal submission indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made prior to any external feedback or pressures relating to publication. This suggests that the exclusions were not influenced by later events such as journal reviews or the pressure from the grant review process.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that the exclusion of these two participants was based on legitimate, methodological reasons documented well in advance of any pressure to produce certain results. This situation aligns with typical research practices rather than an indication of misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

If there was a lab-wide decision to switch software, this would not inherently indicate misconduct.\n\n2. **Technical Failures**: Hardware issues like hard drive failures are relatively common occurrences in any setting that relies heavily on computers. Lena's reported hard drive failure being confirmed by IT adds credibility to this explanation, suggesting a genuine technical issue rather than an excuse for data loss due to misconduct.\n\n3. **Timing and Circumstances**: It is plausible for these events to coincide without any underlying malpractice if the software switch and hard drive failure were independent incidents.

However, unless Lena had control over the lab's decision to switch, this change would likely be independent of her actions.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A genuine hardware failure could be exploited to account for missing files if misconduct were occurring.

While possible, it implies a reliance on external factors, not guaranteed by the misconduct itself.\n\nWhile these factors could align to cover acts of misconduct, they would likely be more incidental than orchestrated solely by Lena's actions, given the IT department's independent confirmation of the hardware failure.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"
