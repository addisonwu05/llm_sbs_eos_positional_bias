  "Based on the provided evidence, it is challenging to definitively conclude one way or another. However, given the combination of factors such as the unusual concentration of p-values just below .05, post hoc changes to the preregistration document, and the exclusion of participants after analysis, there is a stronger indication leaning towards misconduct.
