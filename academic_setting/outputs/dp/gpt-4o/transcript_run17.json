The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Such a switch might happen for several reasons, including access to better features, institutional licensing changes, or alignment with collaborator preferences. If the lab identified a significant benefit in switching software, it could be a reasonable decision, even mid-project.\n\nLaptop hard drive failures are a common issue and can occur unexpectedly. Given that the IT department confirmed a hardware failure and subsequent repair around the time of concern, it lends credence to the claim that this failure was genuine and not a fabricated story to cover misconduct.\n\nCombining these two events—switching software and experiencing a laptop hard drive failure—seems less likely than each event occurring independently, but not implausible, particularly if the lab had legitimate reasons and technical issues that could lead to lost or altered files.\n\nThe fact that both events occur together could raise eyebrows, but they do not alone indicate academic misconduct without additional supporting evidence of intentional wrongdoing. Given Lena’s previous strong record, the combined occurrence can be considered an unfortunate coincidence rather than intentional misconduct.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would estimate the likelihood that both events happened without any misconduct as moderate, acknowledging the unusual circumstances but relying on the supporting evidence for Lena's explanation.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"

Switching software during a project could be a strategy to create plausible deniability for changes in data handling or outcomes, especially if the switch itself wasn't well-documented or justified. However, such a switch could also remain unrelated to misconduct if there were genuine, documented reasons for the transition.\n\nIn the case of a laptop hard drive failure, if Lena intended to manipulate data, a documented hardware failure could conveniently explain missing or altered files, providing an opportunity to claim accidental loss of incriminating data. If intentional misconduct occurred, the confirmed hard drive failure might appear suspect as it aligns conveniently with the potential for missing data.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that technological failures are common occurrences, and the IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure indicates the event did occur. Without concrete evidence of fabrication, it remains a potent coincidence rather than definitive proof of misconduct.\n\nOverall, if misconduct were involved, the likelihood of these events happening could be considered slightly higher than in the absence of misconduct, as the circumstances could potentially serve as advantageous cover stories. Nonetheless, without clear evidence tying these events directly to misconduct, caution is warranted in jumping to conclusions.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"
