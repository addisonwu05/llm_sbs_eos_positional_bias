The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Such participants likely did not provide reliable data, and their exclusion could be justified to prevent skewing the study's findings. Additionally, the presence of notes explaining these exclusions that predate the journal submission supports the notion that the exclusions were planned and documented before the study's results were analyzed and drafted.\n\nThe fact that the notes predate the journal submission is significant because it suggests that these exclusions were not made post hoc to manipulate the findings to be more favorable. The integrity of the process would hinge on whether these notes were made contemporaneously with data collection and analysis, which they appear to be. Therefore, the presence of these notes mitigates the concern of misconduct related to these specific exclusions.\n\nGiven this context, and assuming the notes are authentic and accurately timestamped, it seems plausible that their presence is due to standard research practice rather than misconduct. Based on statistical norms and common research practices, excluding participants based on clear and predefined criteria is not unusual or suspicious.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that the two participants would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

However, creating notes that predate the journal submission would require either advanced planning or manipulating timestamps, which involves a higher level of sophistication and risk of detection compared to other forms of misconduct.\n\nGiven the level of scrutiny involved in academic research, especially under an inquiry, fabricating or manipulating timestamps would be risky. Further, committing misconduct typically involves minimizing the number of detectable changes to avoid suspicion. Adding predated notes adds complexity and risks discovery during an investigation.\n\nIt is still plausible that if misconduct occurred, pre-existing issues with the participants were genuinely noted, even if misconduct happened elsewhere in the data handling. Nevertheless, if misconduct was present, consistently having perfectly predated notes aligning with narrative and data would be less likely, though not impossible.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it seems less likely that the exclusion of participants based on legitimately predated notes would perfectly align with the misconduct narrative.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

However, orchestrating both a software switch and a confirmed hardware failure to cover up misconduct would require coordination beyond typical misconduct tactics.
