The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that she would have run and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, especially if this was part of an established lab practice. The culture in many research environments encourages the exploration of data robustness and sensitivity analyses, which can involve trying out various data processing and analysis methods to ensure that results are not dependent on specific, potentially arbitrary choices. This approach is often seen as part of thorough scientific inquiry and due diligence.\n\nGiven that other students in the lab also exhibit similar patterns in their scripts, this suggests that running multiple analyses to check for robustness could be standard practice in Lena's lab. Therefore, it would not be an uncommon or suspicious behavior in itself, particularly if the lab is known to encourage thorough exploration of data handling approaches. Moreover, if the lab recently underwent a software change, it could have prompted additional testing of different methods to confirm consistent results across different platforms.\n\nConsidering these points, the likelihood that the lab's data management logs would reflect this type of activity by Lena is relatively high if she did not engage in misconduct. Her actions align with the current practices and expectations within her lab, and any irregularities could indeed stem from genuine efforts to adhere to the lab’s standards for robust research, rather than intentional wrongdoing.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

This would involve modifying inclusion or exclusion criteria to see which configuration best fits the desired narrative.\n\nHowever, the fact that other students in the lab also show similar patterns suggests that this practice of running multiple analyses may be part of the standard operating procedures rather than a sign of malicious intent. Therefore, while her keeping multiple scripts could be viewed as a technique used in misconduct, it isn't conclusive evidence in itself if such practices are normal in her lab setting.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the presence of multiple alternative scripts could align with misconduct, it is also consistent with legitimate research practices in her lab, making it an ambiguous indicator when assessed in isolation.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
