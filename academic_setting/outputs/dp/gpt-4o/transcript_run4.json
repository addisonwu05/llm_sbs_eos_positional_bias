The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The presence of notes predating journal submissions supports the notion that these exclusions were part of an intent to maintain rigor rather than an attempt to manipulate the dataset post hoc. \n\nIn scientific research, participants' failure to comply with instructions due to factors like inattentiveness or misunderstanding is not uncommon, especially in psychologically demanding tasks.

Moreover, the fact that these notes were documented before any journal submission strengthens the credibility of the claim that they were excluded for legitimate reasons.\n\nGiven Lena's previous strong record of careful data handling and the presence of documentation justifying the exclusions, it seems plausible these actions were consistent with good research practice rather than misconduct. While no system can be entirely free of error, the steps taken to document these issues lend credibility to the exclusion decision. \n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that the likelihood of the exclusion based on genuine reasons (without any fraudulent intent) is fairly high, considering the common research practice and the existence of predated notes.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

In such a case, the notes would be fabricated or manipulated to align with the exclusion criteria, giving the appearance of rigor and planning to cover inappropriate data manipulation.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of such premeditated behavior may depend on several factors including the level of sophistication in the misconduct, Lena’s understanding of audit protocols, and the perceived risk of being caught. If Lena intentionally decided to fabricate or select data, creating notes in advance would be a way to mitigate suspicion.\n\nNevertheless, the need to fabricate evidence and documentation increases the complexity and potential risk of the misconduct being uncovered during any form of inquiry or replication attempt.

While these events could be leveraged to explain irregularities or gaps in the data, they are generally not directly within the control of an individual and are likely unrelated to any intent to commit fraud.\n\nSwitching software during a project is a decision that typically involves multiple members of a lab or department and is likely made for reasons unrelated to manipulating specific research outcomes. Even if Lena intended to commit misconduct, it would be difficult to exploit a software switch in any way beyond exploiting potential inconsistencies as a cover for discrepancies in the data.\n\nSimilarly, a hard drive failure, though convenient as an explanation for missing files, would need the support of deliberately exploiting the situation if misconduct was intended. However, the failure's confirmation by the IT department introduces external validation that doesn't technically depend on Lena's actions. A misconduct scenario could involve using this failure opportunistically to justify missing or altered data, but the event's occurrence itself would still be independent.\n\nTherefore, while these events could hypothetically be used to cover certain actions, their actual occurrence is still constrained by typical, mundane factors.
