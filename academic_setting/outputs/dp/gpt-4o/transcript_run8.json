The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The fact that notes about these exclusions predate the journal submission suggests that these decisions were made during the data processing phase and not retrospectively altered to fit the desired outcome after receiving reviewer feedback. This supports the argument that the exclusions were based on genuine concerns about data quality rather than an attempt to manipulate the results.\n\nIn research, it's not unusual to encounter participants who didn't fully comprehend the task or who didn't maintain attention, leading to their exclusion from analyses. The pre-existence of notes further strengthens the case that these actions were part of standard data cleaning procedures rather than misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it seems quite plausible that the exclusions were made solely as a result of participants' inability to properly engage with the study.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
