  "Based on the information provided, it is not possible to state with certainty whether Lena committed academic misconduct solely from the given evidence and without a comprehensive investigation that includes examining intentions, documentation, and contextual factors. The presence of red flags does raise concerns, but these need to be assessed by a formal inquiry or ethics committee to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, I cannot conclusively answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to whether Lena committed academic misconduct."
