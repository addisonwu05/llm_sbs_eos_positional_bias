The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Researchers often examine how results change under different analytical conditions, which is a legitimate and common practice to test the robustness of findings. This might involve altering exclusion criteria, statistical thresholds, or other parameters to ensure that findings are consistent across these variations.\n\nGiven the lab's environmental context—a lab-wide initiative to explore robustness—it's plausible that Lena's approach of running and storing multiple analysis scripts was in line with a broader, shared methodological framework. If other students in the lab exhibit similar patterns in their scripts, this activity appears to be a norm rather than an exception, suggesting it is part of the lab's culture and expectations about thorough data analysis.\n\nThe fact that the lab recently switched software and experienced data management issues, such as missing files due to a hard drive failure, can further contribute to the need for multiple drafts and versions as the team navigated these changes. Moreover, Lena's previously strong record of careful data handling supports the interpretation that her actions align more with due diligence than with misconduct.\n\nThus, the likelihood that the lab's data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is consistent with standard research practices intended to uphold rigor and reproducibility, especially in a lab environment prioritizing robustness.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

However, whether this objectively indicates misconduct largely depends on the broader context and her intentions.\n\nFabrication or manipulation could involve generating or adjusting data until desired results are achieved, which might involve running multiple analyses to explore outcomes under varying conditions. This could include tweaking exclusion criteria to deliberately achieve statistically significant results. In this scenario, having various analysis scripts could be part of efforts to identify a combination of criteria that deliver favorable results.\n\nNevertheless, the existence of multiple scripts is not, by itself, conclusive evidence of misconduct. It is a practice also utilized legitimately to test robustness and account for variability, particularly within a lab already engaged in such practices. However, if Lena were committing misconduct, the likelihood of her being more meticulous in storing these files might come into play, either as an attempt to cover up manipulation efforts by showing \"due diligence\" or as a practical step in managing and assessing which analysis produces desirable outcomes.\n\nGiven the shared practices in the lab and the typical purposes of running varied scripts, the likelihood of these logs appearing as such with misconduct being the cause is possibly lower than with genuine intent, albeit not negligible if manipulation methods relied on exploring different analyses.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
