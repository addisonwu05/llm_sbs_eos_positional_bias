  "Based on the information provided, it is not possible to state with certainty that Lena committed academic misconduct. While there are several concerning indicators suggestive of potential misconduct—such as modifications to the preregistration post-data collection and an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05—there are also plausible explanations for some issues, such as technical failures and standard research practices being employed.\n\nTherefore, without definitive evidence proving intentional manipulation or fabrication, and considering alternative explanations, it is not sufficient to conclude decisively that misconduct occurred. Thus:\n\nNo, I cannot conclusively determine that Lena committed academic misconduct based solely on the information provided."
