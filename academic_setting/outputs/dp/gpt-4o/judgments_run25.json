  "As an AI, I can assess probabilities and analyze evidence, but I do not have the capability to definitively declare whether someone committed academic misconduct. Determining misconduct involves examining evidence, context, and intentions, usually by a qualified review board or committee dedicated to such investigations. Given the complexities of research ethics and the need for thorough review by human experts, a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer would not be appropriate or responsible without a full investigation."
