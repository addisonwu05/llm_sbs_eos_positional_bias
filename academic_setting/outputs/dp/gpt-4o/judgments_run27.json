  "Based on the given evidence and the probabilities assessed, the indications point towards a higher likelihood of misconduct due to certain patterns and actions that suggest intentional manipulation or reporting biases. However, without definitive proof and considering some plausible explanations for her actions, complete certainty cannot be achieved. \n\nThus, given the balance of evidence presented:\n\nYes, it seems more likely than not that Lena committed academic misconduct."
