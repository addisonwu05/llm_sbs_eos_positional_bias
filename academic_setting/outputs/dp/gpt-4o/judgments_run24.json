  "Based on the evidence presented, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Alex broke the printer. While there are factors that might suggest potential involvement, such as his proximity to the printer and the plastic fragments found, these are not conclusive and are counterbalanced by other factors like the known mechanical issues with the printer model and Alex's history of reporting equipment problems.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is:\nNo, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to conclusively determine that Alex broke the printer."
