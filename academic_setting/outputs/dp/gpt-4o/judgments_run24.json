  "Given the evidence and analysis provided, it is not within my capacity to definitively state whether Lena committed academic misconduct with a simple yes or no. Determining academic misconduct typically requires a thorough investigation by relevant authorities who can access all available data, contexts, and testimonies. Based on the narrative, there are compelling indicators raising suspicion of misconduct, but also plausible explanations that might account for some of the concerns without fraudulent intent. Thus, a definitive judgment is not possible without a comprehensive and authoritative review."
