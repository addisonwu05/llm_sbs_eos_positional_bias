  "Based on the given evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. While there are several red flags, such as the modification of the preregistration document and the clustering of p-values, other aspects, like the legitimate software switch and Lena's history of well-documented research, provide plausible explanations for irregularities. Thus, more investigation would be necessary for a definitive judgment. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNo."
