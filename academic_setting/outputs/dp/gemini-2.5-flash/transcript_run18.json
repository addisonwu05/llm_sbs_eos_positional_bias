The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Since the practice of exploring robustness with different analysis scripts and exclusion criteria is a \"lab-wide push\" and common among \"other students,\" adhering to this practice would make Lena's data management appear consistent with lab standards.\n2.  **Cover for selective reporting or post-hoc manipulation:** Even if the *final* published results were achieved through fraudulent means (e.g., fabricating data, selectively reporting results that \"look perfect,\" or altering a specific analysis script to get a desired p-value), having a history of exploratory scripts could serve as a plausible cover. She could claim that the reported results emerged after thorough robustness checks, or that the \"clean\" results were genuinely found among the explorations.\n3.  **Misconduct might occur elsewhere in the process:** The misconduct might not be in the *act* of running multiple scripts, but rather in *which* results were ultimately chosen for publication, *how* the data itself was generated or altered, or in making *post-hoc* changes to a specific script without proper justification after seeing preliminary results. The initial exploration via multiple scripts could still genuinely occur, with the manipulation happening later in the decision-making or reporting process.\n\nTherefore, the presence of these logs does not rule out misconduct; in fact, it could be a deliberate strategy to mask it or simply reflect the lab's standard operating procedure that even a dishonest researcher would follow.\n\n85"

Labs frequently update their tools or switch software packages for various reasons (e.g., new versions, better functionality, institutional mandates, cost-effectiveness, or a preference for open-source tools). This is a common operational occurrence in a research setting and is largely independent of whether an individual researcher is honest or dishonest.\n2.  **Confirmed Hard Drive Failure:** Hardware failures are a fact of digital life. Laptops, hard drives, and other electronic components can and do fail, often unexpectedly. The crucial detail here is that the \"IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\" This independent confirmation means the event genuinely occurred, regardless of Lena's actions or intentions concerning the research data.\n3.  **Missing Files:** A hard drive failure naturally leads to data loss or missing files if not adequately backed up.\n\nWhile these events (especially the missing files) could be conveniently used by someone committing misconduct to explain away irregularities or missing original data that might expose their fraud, their *occurrence* is independent of the misconduct itself. A genuine software switch and a genuine, confirmed hard drive failure are mundane but plausible events that can happen to any researcher, whether they are honest or not.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these technical and administrative circumstances occurring is high, irrespective of Lena's integrity.\n\n90"

This shows diligent record-keeping.\n4.  **Predating Submission:** The fact that these notes predate any journal submission is a strong indicator of honest and proactive data quality control.

Participants do fall asleep, misunderstand instructions, or otherwise fail to properly engage with a task. These are legitimate reasons to exclude data.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A dishonest researcher would still want their data management practices to appear normal and defensible. Excluding participants for clearly valid reasons (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions) and documenting it properly is a standard and expected part of data processing. Failing to do so, or having *no* exclusions for such common issues, might actually raise suspicion.\n3.  **Cover for Other Manipulations:** While these *specific* exclusions might be legitimate, a dishonest researcher could still use the overall context of data cleaning and exclusion criteria as a smokescreen. For example, they might legitimately exclude these two participants, but then also \"find\" other reasons to exclude or include other participants based on whether their data helps or hurts the desired outcome, while making those look legitimate as well. The presence of some legitimate exclusions based on prior notes actually *strengthens* the credibility of the data cleaning process overall, potentially making other, less legitimate manipulations harder to spot.\n4.  **Misconduct might be elsewhere:** The misconduct might not be in the initial participant exclusions but in later stages, such as fabricating other data points, manipulating the analysis scripts themselves (after the initial exclusions), or selectively reporting results.\n\nTherefore, the presence of these legitimate, well-documented exclusions is perfectly consistent with a scenario where misconduct is occurring elsewhere in the research process. It's a normal part of research that even a dishonest individual would likely adhere to for transparency and to avoid immediate suspicion.\n\n90"

Intense pressure, like Professor Mills' grant review and the high-profile nature of the current experiment, can push even previously honest and meticulous researchers to cut corners or commit fraud for the first time. In this scenario, Lena's previous clean record would genuinely reflect her conduct at that time.\n2.  **Strategic Deception (Cultivating a Reputation):** A researcher intent on misconduct might deliberately cultivate a reputation for thoroughness and integrity in earlier, less critical projects. This strong prior record would then serve as a valuable shield, making her less likely to be suspected when irregularities arise in a later, more high-stakes project. If she's good at fabricating or manipulating data, she's likely also good at making her data management *look* perfect.\n3.  **Nature of Previous Audits:** While \"well-documented and reproducible\" is a strong rating, audits are not foolproof. They might not catch subtle forms of misconduct, especially if the misconduct in previous projects (if any existed) was less significant or expertly hidden.\n4.  **Misconduct is Context-Dependent:** The specific pressures and opportunities for misconduct in the current \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory\" might differ significantly from her earlier projects, leading to a change in behavior.\n\nTherefore, a strong prior record, while suggestive of honesty, does not preclude the possibility of misconduct in the present circumstances.

Their career progression (e.g., securing a postdoc) is highly dependent on a strong publication record. This is a universally acknowledged stressor in academia.\n2.  **Supervisor and Grant Pressure:** It is common for supervisors to be under pressure for grant renewals, and this pressure often filters down to their students. A \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory\" and a looming \"major grant review\" create a highly stressful environment where positive results are keenly desired by the entire lab, especially the supervisor.\n3.  **Normal Human Emotion:** Expressing hopes, anxieties, and the intense desire for success (\"I need this one to work\") to a trusted friend (via email) is a perfectly normal and healthy way for anyone under significant pressure to vent. It reflects the high stakes involved in her work and her personal investment in its success, not necessarily a willingness to engage in misconduct.\n4.  **Desire for Success vs. Dishonesty:** Wanting a study to \"work\" (i.e., yield significant results that support the hypothesis) is a fundamental motivation for any researcher.

Researchers typically start with a raw dataset and gradually refine their cleaning and exclusion criteria as they gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify outliers, detect potential data quality issues, or apply more specific pre-registered criteria.\n2.  **Refining Exclusion Criteria:** It's common for initial analyses to be run with broader inclusion criteria, and then for stricter or more specific exclusion rules to be applied in later stages based on participant performance, adherence to instructions, or data integrity checks (e.g., identifying participants who might have clicked randomly, or whose hardware malfunctioned).\n3.  **Lab-Wide Practice:** The scenario specifically states that the lab had a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that Lena ran and stored \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria.\" This directly supports the idea that the number of participants included could legitimately vary across different script versions as part of exploring data robustness or refining the final analysis plan.\n4.  **Good Documentation Practice:** The existence of an *earlier version* of the script, recovered from a backup, is indicative of good data management practices (even if some files were lost due to hardware failure, the automated backup system worked for this script).

An honest researcher, aware of the principles of robust science, would avoid such actions unless under extraordinary, clearly documented circumstances, and would not try to obscure the change.\n\nWhile an honest researcher *could* make a mistake in their initial preregistration or genuinely discover an optimal analysis approach only after data collection, the proper procedure would be to *amend* the preregistration with a transparent explanation, not to *modify* the original document to erase the trace of the change. The scenario describes modification, which is highly problematic even if not strictly fraudulent in intent.\n\n15"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **extremely likely** that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Purpose of Misconduct:** The primary goal of academic misconduct, particularly under pressure to achieve \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and \"publishable findings,\" is often to manipulate the research process or reporting to produce a desired (usually positive and significant) outcome.\n*   **Direct Mechanism for P-hacking/HARKing:** Modifying the preregistration document *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a textbook example of methods used to achieve significance when initial results might not be favorable.\n    *   **Changing Exclusion Criteria:** If preliminary analyses using the original criteria didn't yield significant results, a dishonest researcher might experiment with different exclusion criteria until a subset of data produces the desired p-value. Modifying the preregistration retroactively then legitimizes this post-hoc data manipulation.\n    *   **Changing Primary Outcomes:** Similarly, if the initially planned primary outcome didn't show significance, a dishonest researcher might shift to a secondary outcome (or even redefine one) that *did* show significance, then retrospectively change the preregistration to make it appear as if that was always the primary outcome. This is a form of HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n*   **Cover-Up and Appearance of Legitimacy:** A dishonest researcher would want their final, published methodology to appear sound and pre-planned. By altering the preregistration document itself (rather than making a transparent amendment), they attempt to hide the fact that the analytical choices were made *after* seeing the data, thereby making their misconduct harder to detect and their results seem more robust and credible. The scenario also mentioned concerns that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments,\" which, while not directly the preregistration modification, points to a pattern of flexible and post-hoc analytical changes.\n\nThis action directly serves the objectives of someone engaged in academic misconduct by allowing them to retroactively justify analytical decisions that produced favorable results, thus making their fraudulent findings appear legitimate.\n\n99"

    "content": "Based on the synthesis of the likelihood judgments for each piece of evidence, here's an assessment of the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct:\n\n**Evidence Weighing:**\n\n1.  **Lab-wide robustness exploration (multiple scripts/exclusions):** This evidence is largely **neutral**. It's highly likely under both scenarios (95% if innocent, 85% if guilty) as it's a standard lab practice. It doesn't strongly point to or away from misconduct.\n2.  **Software switch & confirmed hard drive failure / missing files:** This evidence is also largely **neutral**. Both are mundane, plausible events, highly likely under both scenarios (95% if innocent, 90% if guilty). It explains missing files but doesn't prove or disprove intent.\n3.  **Legitimate participant exclusions (asleep/misunderstood) with predating notes:** This is **slightly exculpatory**. It shows good data handling in one specific instance (98% if innocent, 90% if guilty). While a dishonest researcher might still do this to maintain an appearance of legitimacy, it's more consistent with careful practice.\n4.  **No prior record of irregularities, passed audit, \"well-documented\":** This is **exculpatory**. It strongly supports Lena's prior integrity and competence (99% if innocent, 75% if guilty). It suggests that if misconduct occurred, it might be a first-time deviation.\n5.  **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, almost none above:** This is **strongly inculpatory**. This pattern is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or selective reporting. It's very unlikely to occur without misconduct (10% if innocent) and extremely likely with misconduct (95% if guilty). This is a major red flag.\n6.  **Emails about pressure (\"save the grant,\" \"kill postdoc chances,\" \"I need this one to work\"):** This is **strongly inculpatory** in terms of motivation. While venting stress is normal for any student (98% if innocent), these pressures are precisely the kind that often drive individuals to commit misconduct (99% if guilty). They provide a clear and compelling motive.\n7.  **Earlier script with more participants, later excluded:** This is largely **neutral**. It reflects the iterative nature of data analysis, plausible for both honest (97% if innocent) and dishonest (85% if guilty) researchers.\n8.  **Preregistration modified *after* data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (timestamps):** This is **extremely strongly inculpatory**. Modifying a preregistration post-data collection, especially to change key analytical decisions, fundamentally undermines its purpose and is a direct indication of attempting to retroactively justify analyses that may have been guided by observed data. It's very unlikely for an innocent researcher to do this (15% if innocent) but extremely likely for a guilty one (99% if guilty).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a strong prior record and some pieces of evidence are neutral or mildly exculpatory (consistent with normal research challenges and good practices), two pieces of evidence stand out as profoundly indicative of misconduct:\n\n*   The highly unusual p-value distribution.\n*   The modification of the preregistration document *after* data collection to alter exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nThese two points are statistically and methodologically highly suspicious and are hallmarks of practices intended to achieve desired results rather than transparently report findings. Combined with the strong motivational pressure revealed in her emails, these factors heavily outweigh the evidence suggesting innocence or providing mundane explanations. It's difficult to conceive of a scenario where both the p-value distribution and the post-data preregistration modification occur coincidentally without intentional manipulation or highly questionable research practices bordering on misconduct.\n\nTaking all factors into account, the probability of academic misconduct is very high.\n\n90"
