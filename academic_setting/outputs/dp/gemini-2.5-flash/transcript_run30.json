The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Falling asleep during a task or not understanding instructions are legitimate and common reasons for exclusion, as their data would likely be invalid or uninterpretable, thus compromising the study's internal validity.\n2.  **Importance of Raw Data Notes:** Maintaining detailed notes in raw data files (or associated lab notebooks/logs) about participant behavior, technical issues, or self-reported problems is considered excellent research hygiene. These notes serve as an audit trail and justification for subsequent data cleaning decisions.\n3.  **Timing of Exclusions:** Decisions about participant exclusion should ideally be made and documented *before* the primary data analysis for a manuscript is finalized and certainly before the paper is submitted to a journal. This ensures transparency and prevents *post-hoc* exclusions that could be perceived as cherry-picking data to achieve statistical significance. For a researcher acting ethically and competently, establishing the final dataset for analysis, including all exclusions, would precede the drafting and submission of the paper.\n\nGiven these points, the described scenario—excluding participants for valid reasons documented in raw data notes *before* journal submission—is entirely consistent with diligent, ethical, and competent research practices. It is what a responsible researcher *should* do.\n\n95"

    "content": "Even if Lena did commit academic misconduct (e.g., intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in other parts of the study), it is still highly likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Standard and Justifiable Practice:** Excluding participants who did not properly engage with the task (fell asleep) or did not comprehend the instructions is a standard and ethically sound practice in cognitive neuroscience. Their data would be considered invalid or compromised, and including it would undermine the study's scientific validity. This is a common data cleaning step that any researcher, ethical or otherwise, would typically perform.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A researcher engaging in misconduct elsewhere in a study would likely still perform many standard, legitimate research practices to avoid detection and maintain an appearance of credibility. Documenting valid exclusions like these in raw data files before submission is a mark of good research practice and would not raise immediate suspicion. In fact, *failing* to exclude such participants would likely be seen as poor data handling by reviewers.\n3.  **Efficiency of Misconduct:** If Lena's goal was to fabricate or falsify data to achieve specific results, she would likely focus her efforts on the data points or analyses that directly contribute to her desired outcome. Dealing with obviously compromised data from non-compliant participants is a separate, routine quality control step that would not typically be overlooked or manipulated in a way that would expose her, especially if the reasons for exclusion are so clear-cut. Excluding these participants simply removes noise and ensures that the data being analyzed (whether manipulated or not) is at least based on compliant individuals.\n\nTherefore, the fact that these two participants were excluded for these specific reasons and with documented notes predating submission is largely independent of whether other forms of misconduct might have occurred. It's a basic due diligence step in data processing.\n\n90"

Professor Mills' pressure for publishable findings before a major grant review could represent such a unique and high-stakes situation for Lena. A researcher with a strong prior record of ethical and careful work might, under extreme duress, succumb to the temptation of misconduct for the first time. In this scenario, her previous clean record would be genuine.\n2.  **Strategic Misconduct:** A person engaging in misconduct might strategically maintain a facade of excellent research practices in less scrutinized or earlier projects to build credibility and trust. A strong prior record could make it harder for others to suspect or detect misconduct in a later, higher-stakes project, as she has a history of competence and integrity to fall back on.\n3.  **Nature of the Audit:** While an independent audit is thorough, it is not infallible. It assesses the documentation and reproducibility of *specific projects*. It might not detect all forms of fabrication, especially if the fraud is sophisticated and designed to mimic real data closely, or if it relates to aspects not fully covered by the audit's scope. However, the rating of \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggests strong *organizational* and *technical* skills, which are not necessarily negated by later misconduct.\n\nTherefore, a clean prior record, including passing an audit, does not preclude the possibility of misconduct in a subsequent study, especially one under high pressure.\n\n70"

It helps researchers understand if their main conclusions are stable or if they are highly sensitive to specific analytical choices.\n2.  **Explicit Lab-Wide Initiative:** The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" directly indicates that this practice was encouraged and expected within the lab. An ethical and diligent PhD student like Lena would naturally participate in such an initiative.\n3.  **Consistent with Peer Behavior:** The observation that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" further normalizes this practice. It suggests that Lena was simply following the established and accepted methodology of her research environment.\n4.  **Transparency and Documentation:** Storing these alternative scripts in data management logs is a sign of good documentation and transparency, allowing for an audit trail of decisions made during the analysis process.

Even a researcher engaging in misconduct would likely conform to these established lab practices to avoid drawing suspicion.\n2.  **Plausible Deniability / Camouflage:** Documenting a wide range of analyses, including those with different exclusion criteria, can serve as a form of camouflage for misconduct. If Lena were engaged in practices like *p-hacking* (running many analyses and only reporting the significant ones), having a history of diverse exploratory scripts would make her choices appear legitimate and part of a thorough investigation, rather than targeted manipulation. She could present the \"clean\" results from one of these many legitimate-looking pathways, while internally knowing she only chose that pathway because it yielded significance.\n3.  **Efficiency of Misconduct:** The act of running and storing multiple scripts is a *process*. The misconduct might lie in the *selection* of which analysis to report, or in the *alteration of data* to make one specific analysis pathway yield desirable results, rather than in the general practice of exploration.

This is a common logistical challenge in research and not inherently suspicious.\n2.  **Hardware Failures are Mundane:** Laptop hard drive failures are unfortunately a common technical issue.

Researchers typically start with a larger raw dataset and progressively apply exclusion criteria as they refine their understanding of the data, participant behavior, and experimental validity. This often involves running preliminary analyses with broader inclusion, then applying stricter or more nuanced criteria for the final, reported analyses.\n2.  **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** As a project progresses, researchers often develop or refine their exclusion criteria based on:\n    *   Detailed review of individual participant data (e.g., identifying participants with highly unusual response patterns, poor performance on basic tasks, or inconsistent data quality).\n    *   New insights into task comprehension or engagement (beyond initial notes).\n    *   Consideration of outliers based on statistical properties of the full dataset.\n    *   Adoption of more rigorous or standard practices for a specific type of experiment.\n3.  **Lab-wide Push for Robustness:** The earlier information about a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and using \"stricter and looser exclusion criteria\" directly supports this. Lena would naturally be testing different exclusion criteria throughout her analysis process, and an earlier script might reflect a less refined or different set of criteria than what was ultimately deemed most appropriate for the final paper.\n4.  **Good Documentation Practice:** The existence of an automated backup containing earlier scripts is a sign of good data management practices, which is consistent with an ethical researcher. This backup simply reflects the evolution of her work.\n\nTherefore, finding an earlier script with more participants, where some were later excluded, is a common and expected outcome of careful, iterative, and transparent data processing in research, not an indicator of misconduct.\n\n99"

The iterative process of data cleaning and refinement, which includes testing different exclusion criteria, is a standard and expected part of rigorous research. By having multiple analysis scripts that reflect this process, Lena could create an appearance of thoroughness and due diligence, even if her ultimate selections were driven by the desire for specific statistical outcomes (e.g., p-hacking).\n2.  **Mechanism for Misconduct:** The existence of multiple scripts with varying participant exclusions provides a potential mechanism for misconduct. If Lena were trying to achieve a specific p-value (like p=.01), she might run analyses with different sets of exclusions until she found the combination that yielded the desired significant result. The earlier script would then represent one of the \"failed\" or preliminary attempts before she landed on the \"successful\" (and potentially manipulated) final set of exclusions.\n3.  **Natural Evolution of Analysis:** Even a researcher intending to commit misconduct would still likely start with a full dataset and then, through a process of testing and refinement, decide which participants to exclude. The misconduct might lie in the *criteria used for the final selection* (e.g., choosing criteria that maximize significance rather than being objectively justified) or in altering data *within* the selected participants, rather than in the general practice of exploring different exclusions.\n4.  **Discovery via Backup:** The fact that this script was recovered from an *automated backup* suggests it wasn't something Lena intentionally presented to mislead. It's simply a record of her analytical journey, which, whether ethical or not, often involves iterating on participant exclusions.\n\nTherefore, the evolution of exclusion criteria across analysis scripts is perfectly compatible with a scenario where misconduct occurred, as it can both hide the misconduct and serve as a tool for achieving desired results.\n\n90"

Its core principle is to declare research plans (hypotheses, methods, exclusion criteria, primary outcomes) *before* data collection or before seeing the data, to enhance transparency and credibility and to guard against practices like p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n2.  **Violation of Good Research Practice:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data has been collected, especially to change key elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly violates the fundamental principles of preregistration. This action immediately raises suspicion of bias, as it allows for tailoring the analytical plan to fit observed results.\n3.  **Ethical Handling of Necessary Changes:** While unforeseen issues can sometimes necessitate changes to a research plan post-preregistration, the ethical and transparent way to handle this is *not* to modify the original preregistration document itself (which is often immutable on platforms like OSF). Instead, researchers are expected to:\n    *   Document the deviations clearly in the final manuscript.\n    *   Provide full justification for the changes.\n    *   Report analyses based on both the original plan (if feasible) and the modified plan, clearly distinguishing between confirmatory and exploratory findings.\n    Modifying the actual preregistration document's timestamps to show post-data collection changes is an act that fundamentally undermines the integrity of preregistration.\n4.  **Implication for \"No Misconduct\":** If Lena genuinely did *not* commit academic misconduct, this action represents a severe lapse in understanding or adherence to basic principles of transparent and reproducible research, particularly concerning a \"high-profile experiment.\" While not necessarily evidence of *fabrication or falsification* of data, it is a practice that creates the strong *appearance* of misconduct and is generally considered unacceptable by current research integrity standards. An honest researcher, even if making a mistake, would be expected to handle deviations from a preregistration with utmost transparency, not by retroactively altering the document itself.\n\nTherefore, this specific action is highly incompatible with the conduct expected of a researcher not engaged in misconduct, as it directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and transparency.\n\n10"

It directly undermines the transparency and integrity that preregistration aims to achieve, allowing a researcher to retroactively adjust their plan to fit observed data, a practice known as HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) or p-hacking, which can lead to false positives and unreproducible science.\n2.  **Motivation for Desired Results:** Lena is under pressure to produce \"strong, statistically significant\" and \"clean\" results for a \"high-profile experiment\" before a \"major grant review.\" If the initial data or analysis using the *original* preregistered plan did not yield these desired outcomes, a researcher intent on misconduct would be strongly motivated to alter the plan. Changing exclusion criteria could remove \"unfavorable\" participants, and changing primary outcomes could allow for the reporting of a significant effect that was perhaps originally a secondary or exploratory finding.\n3.  **Concealment and Deception:** The act of *modifying the preregistration document itself* (with timestamps indicating post-data collection changes), rather than transparently reporting deviations, indicates an intent to deceive and present a post-hoc analysis as if it were pre-planned. This is a classic maneuver for a researcher attempting to manipulate the reporting of results to achieve publication, while simultaneously trying to maintain an appearance of rigor.\n\nTherefore, this action is not just compatible with misconduct; it is a very strong indicator and a common mechanism *of* misconduct when researchers are under pressure to produce specific findings.\n\n99"

You would expect to see roughly as many p-values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .053) as those just below (e.g., .049, .047). A sharp cutoff where many values cluster just below .05 and almost none appear just above it is a strong statistical indicator of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It implies that researchers either ran many analyses and only reported the ones that barely crossed the significance threshold, or they made analytical choices designed to push p-values just below .05.\n2.  **Red Flag for Bias:** This specific pattern is widely recognized in the scientific community as a strong indicator of questionable research practices that undermine the validity of findings. For a genuine, unbiased analysis, such a distribution would be an extraordinary and highly improbable coincidence.\n3.  **Incompatible with \"No Misconduct\":** The definition of \"no academic misconduct\" implies that results are genuine and any errors are unintentional.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would write emails expressing that her supervisor was counting on the study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she \"needs this one to work.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Common Academic Pressure:** PhD students, especially in competitive fields and on high-profile projects, routinely face immense pressure to produce publishable, significant results. Their career trajectory (like securing a postdoc) is often directly tied to the success of their research projects. This is a pervasive reality in academia, regardless of a researcher's ethical stance.\n2.  **Supervisor Expectations:** It's common for supervisors to have high hopes for studies, particularly when grant funding or lab reputation is at stake. Lena's comment that Professor Mills was \"counting on this study to save the grant\" reflects a realistic perception of her supervisor's situation and the project's importance.\n3.  **Personal Stakes:** The concern about a null result killing her postdoc chances is a genuine and widespread anxiety among PhD students. A \"successful\" publication (often implying significant findings) is a critical credential for future career opportunities.\n4.  **Desire for Success:** The statement \"I need this one to work\" expresses a strong personal desire for success and validation, which is natural for any highly invested individual. An ethical researcher would still passionately hope for their theory to be supported and for their hard work to yield meaningful results, as long as they arrive at those results through legitimate means.\n\nThese emails convey understandable pressure, ambition, and anxiety that are completely consistent with an ethical researcher operating within a demanding academic environment. They do not inherently suggest an intent to manipulate data, but rather a strong motivation for professional success.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is extremely likely that she would write emails expressing that her supervisor was counting on the study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she \"needs this one to work.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Primary Motivator for Misconduct:** The intense pressure and high stakes described in these emails are precisely the kinds of motivators that often lead researchers, especially junior ones, to commit academic misconduct. The fear of career stagnation (\"kill my chances at a postdoc\") and the desire to meet the supervisor's expectations for a critical grant review (\"counting on this study to save the grant\") create an environment where the temptation to manipulate results can become overwhelming.\n2.  **Rationalization/Desperation:** The phrase \"I need this one to work\" perfectly encapsulates the feeling of desperation or extreme need that can precede or accompany dishonest actions in research. It suggests a belief that the consequences of a negative outcome are personally catastrophic, making the choice to manipulate data seem like a necessary evil to some.\n3.  **Contextual Fit:** The content of these emails perfectly aligns with the scenario where a researcher, under duress, might resort to unethical means to achieve desired outcomes. They provide a clear explanation for *why* Lena might have committed misconduct.\n\nTherefore, these emails are highly consistent with, and indeed often serve as evidence of, the motivational context in which academic misconduct occurs.\n\n98"

    "content": "Based on the provided evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct appears to be very high.\n\nHere's a summary of the most impactful pieces of evidence:\n\n**Strongly Indicative of Misconduct:**\n\n*   **Preregistration modified after data collection:** This is a critical violation of research integrity. The purpose of preregistration is to declare methods *before* seeing the data to prevent bias. Retroactively changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a direct form of misconduct, making it extremely unlikely for an ethical researcher (10% likelihood if innocent) but extremely likely for someone committing misconduct (99% likelihood if guilty).\n*   **Unusual p-value distribution:** A clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. This pattern is statistically highly improbable by chance (5% likelihood if innocent) but extremely common when misconduct occurs to achieve desired significance (98% likelihood if guilty).\n*   **Emails expressing extreme pressure:** Lena's internal communication reveals intense pressure from her supervisor and high personal stakes for her career. While these emotions are common in academia, they represent a strong *motive* for misconduct, making these emails extremely likely if she were guilty (98% likelihood) and also highly likely if she were innocent but under pressure (95% likelihood). This is strong contextual evidence.\n\n**Neutral or Contextual Evidence (doesn't strongly point to either, or slightly mitigates but doesn't outweigh direct evidence):**\n\n*   **Prior clean record:** Her previous studies passing audits and being well-documented is positive. However, misconduct can be a first-time occurrence driven by exceptional pressure, or even a strategic act by someone who has previously acted ethically. So, while somewhat less likely, it's still plausible even if she committed misconduct (70% likelihood if guilty vs. 98% if innocent).\n*   **Exclusion of 2 participants for valid reasons:** This is standard practice and highly likely regardless of whether misconduct occurred elsewhere (95% vs. 90%).\n*   **Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria (lab-wide push):** While this can be a legitimate practice for robustness, it also provides cover for p-hacking (99% vs. 90%). The *act* of running them is common, but the *selection* of which to report becomes critical.\n*   **Software switch, hard drive failure, missing files:** These are unfortunate but mundane technical issues that are independent of Lena's integrity (95% vs. 90%). However, they could coincidentally provide convenient explanations or cover for missing problematic data.\n*   **Earlier script with more participants later excluded:** This reflects the iterative nature of data cleaning, which is normal. Similar to multiple scripts, it's plausible in both scenarios (99% vs. 90%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence related to the preregistration modification and the highly suspicious p-value distribution are extremely damning. These are not \"honest mistakes\" but rather direct indicators of practices intended to manipulate or misrepresent research findings. While Lena's prior good record and the presence of mundane issues could offer alternative explanations for *some* irregularities, they do not plausibly account for the systematic nature of the preregistration change or the distinct statistical anomaly in the p-values. The strong motive documented in her emails further reinforces the likelihood of intentional misconduct.\n\nConsidering the cumulative weight of this evidence, especially the critical points about preregistration and p-values, the probability of academic misconduct is very high.\n\n95"
