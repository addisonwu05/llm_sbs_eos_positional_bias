The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This choice implies a willingness to disregard ethical research principles.\n\nHowever, the question concerns the likelihood of her *previous studies* passing an independent data audit and being rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\" These qualities relate to her organizational skills, transparency in data handling, and adherence to formal research practices.\n\nThere are several ways to consider this:\n\n1.  **\"One-Off\" Misconduct Due to Pressure:** Given the high-pressure environment for the current study (grant review, supervisor's pressure, high-profile experiment), it's plausible that Lena, despite having a strong ethical track record, buckled under immense pressure in this specific instance. In this scenario, her previous work being genuinely ethical, well-documented, and reproducible would be entirely consistent with her character *prior* to this specific high-stakes situation.\n\n2.  **Sophisticated Misconduct:** If Lena is a researcher who is willing to commit misconduct, she might also be very strategic. Maintaining a facade of excellent research practices, including meticulous documentation and reproducibility in previous (and perhaps less scrutinized) projects, would build trust and a strong reputation. This reputation could then serve as a shield against suspicion if irregularities arose in a later, more high-profile study. In this case, her previous good record would be a deliberate act to obscure her current or potential future misconduct.\n\n3.  **Misconduct and Organization are Separate Skills:** Committing data manipulation (a breach of honesty) does not inherently mean a researcher is disorganized or incapable of meticulous documentation. An individual can be highly organized and technically proficient in data management and analysis, while simultaneously making an unethical choice regarding the data's integrity. In fact, a highly organized manipulator might be more difficult to detect precisely because their work appears so clean on the surface.\n\nTherefore, the fact that Lena committed misconduct in the current study does not make it unlikely that her previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as well-documented and reproducible. In both the \"one-off\" and \"sophisticated manipulator\" scenarios, a clean prior record is either genuine or strategically maintained.\n\n75"

Having a clear progression of data cleaning, where some participants are excluded, can make the process appear more rigorous and less suspicious, even if other, more problematic manipulations are occurring elsewhere.\n3.  **Refinement of Analysis Plan:** A researcher, even one intending misconduct, might still genuinely refine their analysis plan over time.

If guilty, it is very high (95%) as a means to make post-hoc decisions appear pre-planned.\n3.  **Strong motive:** Lena's emails expressing extreme pressure (\"supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") provide a clear and powerful motive for committing misconduct. While an innocent person could also feel this pressure (likelihood 98%), it is an equally strong, if not stronger, motivator for someone contemplating misconduct (likelihood 98%).\n\n**Evidence that could be consistent with either innocence or guilt (less discriminatory):**\n\n1.  **Lab-wide robustness exploration:** The presence of multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, is consistent with both innocent (likelihood 99%) and guilty (likelihood 90%) scenarios. A guilty person might maintain this practice as a facade of rigor.\n2.  **Software switch and hard drive failure:** These are independent, verifiable external events. They are highly likely to occur regardless of Lena's guilt or innocence (likelihood 99% for innocent, 95% for guilty). They serve as plausible \"mundane explanations\" for missing files or irregularities, which a guilty person might exploit.\n3.  **Earlier script with more participants:** The natural evolution of data cleaning often leads to exclusions. This is consistent with both innocent (likelihood 95%) and guilty (likelihood 95%) scenarios, as selective exclusion is a p-hacking technique.\n4.  **Exclusion of 2 problematic participants with predating notes:** This demonstrates good research practice. Both innocent (likelihood 100%) and guilty (likelihood 95%) researchers would likely perform such basic, legitimate data cleaning to maintain an appearance of credibility.\n\n**Evidence somewhat suggesting innocence (but not conclusive against misconduct):**\n\n1.  **Previously clean audit record:** Lena's prior studies passing an independent data audit and being rated \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates a history of good research practices. If innocent, this is very likely (99%). If guilty, it's less likely but still possible (75%), perhaps indicating a \"one-off\" act under pressure, or a sophisticated attempt to build a reputable facade. However, a good past record doesn't preclude a first-time offense, especially under intense pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two pieces of evidence related to the p-value distribution and the post-hoc modification of the preregistration document are highly specific and strong indicators of misconduct. These are not easily explained by \"honest mistakes\" or \"miscommunication\" when considered together. They point directly to intentional actions to achieve and present significant results in a misleading way.\n\nWhile Lena has a good prior record and some \"mundane explanations\" for other irregularities exist, these do not sufficiently counter the strong evidence of manipulation in the current study. The strong motive further contextualizes why such actions might have occurred.\n\nTherefore, the collective weight of the evidence points strongly towards Lena having committed academic misconduct in this study.\n\n85"
