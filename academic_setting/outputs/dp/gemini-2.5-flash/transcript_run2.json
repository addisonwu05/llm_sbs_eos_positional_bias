The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

An extreme misunderstanding of the fundamental principles and purpose of preregistration by a third-year PhD student in a high-profile study for a top journal.\n2.  A significant administrative error or technical glitch that coincidentally altered the preregistration document in a way that changed key aspects of the study after data collection, without Lena's intentional action or knowledge, and somehow benefited the reported results.\n3.

This specific action is a red flag for misconduct precisely because it is so rarely benign.

This is a severe violation of research integrity principles and a classic indicator of HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) or p-hacking, designed to make results appear significant when they might not be. My previous judgment indicated this is extremely unlikely (10%) to occur if Lena did *not* commit misconduct, but highly likely (100%) if she did.\n2.  **Suspicious p-value distribution:** The final dataset shows an \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" for several exploratory analyses. This is a well-known statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are adjusted or only reported if they achieve statistical significance. My previous judgment indicated this is extremely unlikely (10%) to occur if Lena did *not* commit misconduct, but highly likely (95%) if she did.\n3.  **Strong motive:** Lena's emails explicitly state high pressure from her supervisor (\"counting on this study to save the grant\") and personal career consequences (\"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"). While feeling pressure doesn't equate to misconduct, it provides a clear motive for someone to deviate from ethical practices.\n\n**Evidence offering potential innocent explanations or mitigating factors:**\n\n1.  **Prior good record:** Lena has no prior record of data irregularities; her previous projects passed independent audits and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\" This suggests a general history of ethical conduct.\n2.  **Mundane explanations for some irregularities:** The lab switched software, and Lena's laptop hard drive failed (confirmed by IT), leading to some missing files. These are neutral facts that can explain some data inconsistencies or missing raw files without implying misconduct.\n3.  **Legitimate data cleaning:** Two participants were excluded based on pre-submission notes indicating they fell asleep or didn't understand instructions. This is a standard and acceptable practice.\n4.  **Lab-wide robustness exploration:** The data management logs show Lena, like other students, ran multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide push for robustness. This could suggest legitimate exploration rather than malicious p-hacking, though it also provides a mechanism through which p-hacking *could* occur if one were inclined.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe two most damaging pieces of evidence are the post-hoc preregistration modification and the highly improbable p-value distribution. These are specific actions/outcomes that directly undermine research integrity and are extremely difficult to explain as \"honest mistakes\" or \"miscommunication\" by an otherwise competent PhD student, especially given their cumulative effect towards producing \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory.\" While a prior good record initially makes misconduct seem less likely, the specific, compelling evidence of highly problematic actions in *this* study, coupled with a strong motive, suggests a departure from her previous standards, possibly due to immense pressure. The mundane explanations (hard drive, software switch) account for some irregularities but do not explain these two critical, deliberate-seeming actions. The \"lab-wide push for robustness\" could be an innocent explanation for running multiple scripts, but it doesn't explain the *selective reporting* or *preregistration changes* that would lead to the suspicious p-value distribution and \"too perfect\" results.\n\nThe convergence of a strong motive, highly suspicious process changes (preregistration), and highly suspicious results patterns (p-value distribution) points strongly towards intentional misconduct.\n\n75"
