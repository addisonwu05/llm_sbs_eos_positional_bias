The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

It demonstrates a thorough and transparent approach to data analysis.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Policy**: The scenario explicitly states that this practice was \"as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" This indicates that it was an encouraged and expected procedure within Professor Mills's lab, not an unusual or suspicious activity unique to Lena.\n3.  **Consistency with Peers**: The fact that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" further reinforces that this is standard operating procedure within that research environment. Lena's actions in this regard are consistent with her peers and lab protocols, suggesting she was following established guidelines.\n4.  **Consistency with Innocence**: If Lena is innocent and not engaged in misconduct, then her adherence to legitimate, lab-sanctioned practices for exploring data robustness is entirely expected.

She might run many analyses until she found one that produced the desired \"clean\" and \"statistically significant\" results, even if the underlying data were manipulated or the choices were post-hoc and motivated by the outcome. The existence of these diverse scripts could then serve as a plausible cover, making it appear as though she was diligently exploring robustness, rather than searching for a specific outcome or obscuring misconduct.\n2.  **Maintaining an appearance of normal practice:** The scenario states that this practice was \"as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\" If Lena were committing misconduct, she would likely want her activities to blend in with standard lab practice to avoid suspicion. Deviating from a lab-wide push for robustness (i.e., *not* having multiple scripts) might draw more attention than conforming to it, even if her intent was malicious.\n3.  **Exploiting systemic norms:** A person engaged in misconduct might leverage existing, legitimate research practices to obscure their actions. The general acceptance and encouragement of exploring robustness through multiple analyses provides a convenient framework within which a researcher could manipulate data or select analyses to produce desired results while maintaining an outward appearance of rigor.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena were engaged in misconduct, the presence of these logs would not be contradictory and could even be a strategic part of her attempts to obscure her actions.\n\n80"

The intense pressure from Professor Mills and the impending grant review for this high-profile experiment could represent a unique and overwhelming stressor that led Lena to make unethical choices for the first time. In this scenario, her prior work genuinely would have been clean and passed audits.\n2.  **Nature of Misconduct:** If the misconduct in the current study is, for example, a specific form of data manipulation (e.g., specific data exclusion criteria chosen post-hoc to achieve significance, or subtle tweaking of values), it might be a newly adopted strategy under extreme pressure, which wasn't part of her practice in previous, potentially less pressured, projects. While fabrication would be harder to reconcile with a \"well-documented and reproducible\" rating, even a systematic fraudster can improve over time or exploit weaknesses in audit procedures. However, the most straightforward interpretation is that previous audits genuinely reflected her earlier, ethical work.\n3.  **Audits are Not Infallible (but often robust):** While \"independent data audit\" and \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggest thoroughness, no audit is 100% foolproof, especially against a determined individual or against subtle forms of manipulation. However, given the strong rating, it's more probable that her previous work *was* genuinely clean rather than that she systematically committed fraud and expertly fooled a robust audit.\n\nTherefore, the existence of a clean prior record and successful audits does not preclude the possibility of her committing misconduct in the current, highly pressured study. Her past could genuinely reflect good practice, with the current situation being a departure from that.\n\n75"

Such participants' data would be considered invalid regardless of any researcher's intent.\n2.  **Maintaining Plausibility and Appearances:** A researcher engaged in misconduct would likely want to maintain an appearance of legitimate scientific practice wherever possible. Transparently excluding obviously problematic participants based on well-documented reasons (notes in raw data files, predating submission) is a hallmark of good research. It would be counterproductive and draw unnecessary suspicion to *include* such data or to *falsify* these types of legitimate exclusions.\n3.  **Consistency with Other Misconduct:** Misconduct often occurs selectively or under specific pressures, not necessarily permeating every single decision. Lena might manipulate other aspects of the data or analysis, but still follow proper procedures for these straightforward and defensible exclusions. Having these legitimate exclusions documented provides a baseline of normal, good practice, which could even help obscure other less defensible actions.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena committed misconduct in other areas, these specific exclusions are so clearly justified and well-documented that their existence is entirely consistent with a researcher, whether honest or dishonest, following fundamental principles of data quality.\n\n95"

Researchers frequently refine their methods, including exclusion criteria, as they delve deeper into the data, identify outliers, or gain a better understanding of participant performance or data quality issues. An earlier script might reflect a preliminary pass with broader inclusion, which then gets refined.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Push for Robustness:** The scenario already states that Lena was running and storing \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" This directly supports the idea that different versions of scripts would exist, reflecting different decisions about participant inclusion. It's common to start with a broader set and then apply stricter criteria, or to test the effect of different exclusion thresholds.\n3.  **Improving Data Quality:** An honest researcher would continually strive to improve the quality of their data and analysis. This often involves identifying participants whose data might compromise the integrity of the findings (e.g., due to poor task engagement, misunderstanding instructions even if not explicitly reported, technical issues not immediately obvious). Such refinement naturally leads to some participants being excluded in later stages of analysis, even if they were initially included.\n4.  **Transparency Implied by Automated Backup:** The fact that an \"earlier version... recovered from an automated backup\" exists and shows this evolution is actually a sign of transparency in the research process. It allows for the full history of analysis decisions to be traced, which is a good practice for reproducibility, not a sign of misconduct when done legitimately.\n\nTherefore, for an honest researcher, having different participant sets in different versions of analysis scripts is a normal and expected part of the scientific process of refinement and robustness checking.\n\n95"

If certain participants' data are not supporting the hypothesis or are making the results \"messy,\" a researcher motivated by misconduct might strategically exclude them.\n2.  **Maintaining Plausibility:** If Lena were engaged in such selective exclusion, she would likely want to present these exclusions as legitimate methodological refinements. The existence of an earlier script including those participants, followed by a later script where they are excluded, can be spun as \"refining exclusion criteria\" or \"improving data quality\" – which are legitimate scientific practices when done transparently and pre-registered, but can be misused for misconduct.\n3.  **Exploiting Lab Norms:** The scenario notes that the lab has a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" by running \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria.\" A researcher committing misconduct could easily leverage this legitimate lab culture as a cover for making post-hoc, outcome-driven exclusion decisions. The automated backup simply preserves this history.\n4.  **Discovery of Misconduct:** In many cases of academic misconduct involving data manipulation, the detection comes from finding inconsistencies in data handling or analysis choices over time. An earlier script showing broader inclusion, followed by a later script with strategic exclusions that result in \"cleaner\" or significant results, is precisely the kind of evidence an inquiry might uncover if misconduct were present.\n\nTherefore, the presence of such an analysis history is not only consistent with misconduct but could be a direct manifestation of it, or a byproduct that aids in its detection.\n\n90"

Grant funding is vital for labs, and publishable results (especially positive ones in high-profile journals) are often essential for securing post-doctoral positions.\n2.  **Legitimate Desire for Success:** Any researcher, especially one deeply invested in a project, genuinely wants their experiments to \"work\" – meaning they want to find evidence that supports their hypotheses, contributes to knowledge, and is publishable.

Its core purpose is to increase transparency and combat practices like p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) by locking in critical decisions before potential outcome biases can influence them.\n2.  **Severity of the Action:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection to alter primary outcomes or exclusion criteria is considered a serious breach of scientific integrity and a significant questionable research practice (QRP). It undermines the very credibility and value of the preregistration itself.\n3.  **Contradiction with \"Careful Data Handling\":** Lena has a \"previously strong record of careful data handling\" and her past projects were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\" Such a record would suggest an understanding and adherence to good scientific practices. Altering a preregistration post-data collection fundamentally contradicts the principles of transparency and rigor that \"careful data handling\" typically implies.\n4.  **Possible, but Problematic \"Innocent\" Explanations:** While not outright fabrication, an \"innocent\" explanation for such an action would involve a profound misunderstanding of preregistration principles, severe methodological sloppiness, or immense pressure leading to poor judgment.

This practice is commonly known as \"p-hacking\" (adjusting analyses until a significant p-value is found) or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known, which includes altering primary outcomes). If Lena needed to make the study \"work\" and the initial analysis didn't, changing these parameters post-hoc would be a direct way to achieve the desired results.\n2.  **Motivation from Pressure:** Lena's emails express intense pressure (\"supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"). This pressure provides a strong motive for her to manipulate the analysis plan if the raw data did not naturally support the hypothesis.\n3.  **Consistency with Whistleblower's Claim:** The whistleblower claimed that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments.\" While the preregistration modification might predate reviewer comments, it signals a willingness to alter foundational analysis plans. Modifying the preregistration to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria is a fundamental change to \"key analyses\" and aligns perfectly with the type of misconduct suspected.\n4.  **Attempt to Legitimise Post-Hoc Decisions:** While ultimately detectable and unethical, a researcher engaged in misconduct might attempt to retrospectively modify a preregistration document to make their post-hoc, outcome-driven analytical choices *appear* as if they were pre-planned. This provides a superficial veneer of legitimacy, even if the timing reveals the deception.\n\nTherefore, this specific action is highly congruent with, and could even be a direct manifestation of, the academic misconduct Lena is suspected of committing.\n\n98"

In a set of exploratory analyses, one would expect a mix, and due to random sampling variability, some p-values would naturally fall just below .05 (e.g., .047) and others just above (e.g., .051).\n2.  **The \"Cliff\" Effect:** An \"unusually high concentration\" just below .05 coupled with \"almost no p-values just above .05\" is often referred to as a \"p-value cliff\" or \"p-value discontinuity.\" This pattern is a statistical red flag. It strongly suggests that non-significant results (p > .05) were either not reported, or that analyses were repeatedly run and tweaked (a practice known as p-hacking) until the p-value just barely dipped below the .05 threshold.\n3.  **Against Random Chance:** While chance always plays a role in any single p-value, for *several* exploratory analyses to consistently show this pattern without any underlying manipulation would be an extremely improbable statistical fluke. The cumulative probability of such an unlikely distribution occurring purely by chance in multiple analyses is astronomically low.\n4.  **Inconsistent with Innocent Intent:** An honest researcher reports the results as they are, without selectively choosing analyses or tweaking parameters to achieve a desired p-value. The existence of this specific pattern is a hallmark of outcome-driven analysis, which is directly contradictory to the principles of honest, transparent research.\n\nTherefore, for this pattern to emerge if Lena were truly innocent would mean that a series of highly improbable chance events occurred across multiple analyses, which is a statistical unlikelihood of the highest order.\n\n5"

These are common forms of academic misconduct where researchers run multiple analyses, tweak exclusion criteria, transform variables, or selectively report results until a statistically significant p-value (p < .05) is achieved.\n2.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The scenario describes Lena as being under immense pressure to produce \"publishable findings\" for a major grant review, with her supervisor \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" and Lena explicitly stating \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" and \"I need this one to work.\" These motivations provide a direct incentive to engage in practices that lead to such a p-value distribution if the raw data do not naturally yield significant results.\n3.  **Consistency with Other Evidence:**\n    *   The whistleblower's claim that some data \"look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed\" aligns perfectly with this pattern, as p-hacking often leads to results that appear suspiciously clean or statistically convenient.\n    *   The fact that Lena ran \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria\" provides a direct mechanism through which p-hacking could occur. By trying different criteria, she could find the combination that pushes p-values just below .05 for desired effects, while discarding or downplaying analyses that yielded p-values just above .05.\n4.  **Desired Outcome:** The goal of p-hacking is precisely to achieve statistically significant results, often leading to p-values that just barely cross the threshold, rather than strong effects (like p=.01) consistently across all analyses. The \"unusually high concentration\" near .05, especially for \"exploratory analyses,\" suggests that these were the results that were either sought out or specifically retained and reported.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, particularly in the forms of p-hacking or selective reporting, this observed p-value distribution is exactly what one would expect to find as evidence of such actions.\n\n99"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence presented:\n\n**Evidence Weighing Towards Innocence / Honest Mistakes:**\n*   **Prior Good Record:** Lena has no prior record of data irregularities, passed an independent data audit, and her previous work was rated \"well-documented and reproducible\" (100% likely if innocent, 75% likely if guilty). This is a strong point in her favor, suggesting a general predisposition towards good scientific practice.\n*   **Normal Lab Practices:** The lab's data management logs show her running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, as part of a lab-wide push for robustness (95% likely if innocent, 80% likely if guilty). This indicates she was following common and often good scientific practice.\n*   **Legitimate Exclusions:** Two participants were legitimately excluded based on notes predating submission for valid reasons (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) (100% likely if innocent, 95% likely if guilty). This shows proper data handling for clear issues.\n*   **Iterative Analysis:** An earlier script included more participants later excluded (95% likely if innocent, 90% likely if guilty). This is often a normal part of refining analysis.\n*   **Mundane Explanations:** The lab software switch and the confirmed hard drive failure account for some irregularities or missing files (100% likely if innocent, 100% likely if guilty). These are neutral but provide non-malicious reasons for some issues.\n\n**Evidence Weighing Towards Guilt / Misconduct:**\n*   **High Pressure/Motive:** Lena's emails explicitly state intense pressure from her supervisor regarding the grant and her postdoc chances, indicating a strong motive to achieve significant results (\"I need this one to work\") (100% likely if innocent, 100% likely if guilty). This is a strong indicator of motive, regardless of innocence or guilt.\n*   **Post-Data Preregistration Modification:** The preregistration document was modified *after* data collection, changing planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (20% likely if innocent, 98% likely if guilty). This is a critical red flag. The very purpose of preregistration is to prevent such post-hoc changes, which are a direct mechanism for p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known). For an otherwise \"careful\" researcher, this is a severe deviation from good practice.\n*   **P-Value Distribution:** The final dataset shows an *unusually high concentration* of p-values just below .05, with *almost no* p-values just above .05, especially for exploratory analyses (5% likely if innocent, 99% likely if guilty). This is a statistically improbable pattern to occur by chance and is a classic signature of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are tweaked or chosen to achieve significance. This is the most damning piece of evidence.\n*   **Whistleblower Claim:** The anonymous whistleblower's claim of data looking \"too perfect\" and changed analyses aligns with the patterns above, although it's an unverified claim initially.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile Lena has a good prior record and some \"mundane explanations\" exist for minor irregularities, the two strongest pieces of evidence point very strongly towards academic misconduct:\n\n1.  **The post-data collection modification of the preregistration document to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria.** This is a direct violation of fundamental principles of transparent research and a common method of manipulating results.\n2.  **The \"p-value cliff\" phenomenon.** This specific statistical distribution of results (many just below .05, almost none just above) is extremely unlikely to occur naturally and is considered a strong statistical indicator of selective reporting or p-hacking.\n\nThese two pieces of evidence, particularly when taken together and in the context of high pressure and a stated need for the study to \"work,\" are extremely difficult to reconcile with honest, unintentional mistakes, even for a researcher with a good past record. While a good past record indicates general diligence, it does not preclude a first-time lapse under extreme pressure. The *nature* of the irregularities (post-hoc changes to preregistration and a highly suspicious p-value distribution) goes beyond mere sloppiness or technical mishaps.\n\nConsidering the cumulative weight of the highly suspicious statistical pattern and the deliberate alteration of the preregistration post-data, the probability of academic misconduct is very high.\n\n90"
