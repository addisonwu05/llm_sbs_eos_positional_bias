The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Researchers frequently:\n1.  **Start broadly:** Begin with a full dataset.\n2.  **Iterate and refine:** Run preliminary analyses, identify potential issues (e.g., outliers, poor data quality, participants who clearly didn't understand or follow instructions despite initial screening, participants who did not complete enough trials).\n3.  **Apply exclusion criteria:** Based on these observations and predefined rules (or rules developed and justified during the analysis process, which should ideally be documented), certain participants are excluded from the final analysis to ensure data quality and validity.\n4.  **Version control:** Keeping earlier versions of scripts, even if through automated backups, is good practice and shows a history of the analytical process.\n\nThe fact that \"the lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness,\" further supports the idea that iterating on exclusion criteria is standard practice in her lab.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern of having an earlier script with more participants than the final dataset is entirely consistent with a rigorous and iterative data cleaning and analysis process.

In such a case, this highly specific and biased pattern of p-values would be an extremely unlikely random occurrence.

This pattern is not merely consistent with misconduct; it is often a direct result or even a defining characteristic of it.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that this specific and suspicious p-value distribution would be present in her dataset, as it serves as strong evidence of the very behavior she is accused of.\n\n95"

    "content": "The inquiry into Lena's potential research misconduct has uncovered several pieces of information, some of which support her claim of honest mistakes, while others point strongly towards intentional manipulation.\n\n**Evidence that makes misconduct less likely (or has mundane explanations):**\n\n*   **Prior Good Record:** Lena's previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\" This indicates a history of good practice and competence.\n*   **Valid Participant Exclusions:** Two participants were excluded for legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions), with notes predating submission. This shows appropriate data handling in some instances.\n*   **Technical Issues:** A lab software switch and a confirmed hard drive failure account for some missing files and data irregularities. These are external, non-malicious events.\n*   **Lab Culture of Robustness:** The lab's logs show Lena (and others) ran multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria for robustness, which is a good scientific practice in principle. Lena's insistence on honest mistakes.\n\n**Evidence that makes misconduct more likely:**\n\n*   **High Pressure:** Lena was under immense pressure from her supervisor regarding a grant review, and she personally felt a \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" stating, \"I need this one to work.\" This provides a strong motivation for misconduct.\n*   **Modified Preregistration:** File timestamps show the preregistration document was modified *after data collection*, changing planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a severe breach of research integrity, as it undermines the purpose of preregistration and strongly suggests post-hoc manipulation of analysis plans to achieve desired results.\n*   **Suspicious P-value Distribution:** The final dataset exhibits an \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" for several exploratory analyses. This is a widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where analytical choices are made to push results across the significance threshold. This pattern is highly unlikely to occur by chance in ethical research.\n*   **Earlier Script with More Participants:** An earlier script includes participants later excluded. While sometimes part of legitimate refinement, in the context of the modified preregistration and p-value distribution, it raises concern that exclusions might have been selectively applied to achieve statistical significance.\n*   **Whistleblower Claim:** The anonymous claim that data \"look too perfect\" and analyses were changed after reviews aligns with the specific evidence of the p-value distribution and modified preregistration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a history of good practice and some irregularities have innocent explanations, the core evidence for misconduct is very strong and difficult to attribute to \"honest mistakes.\" The post-data-collection modification of the preregistration document, combined with the classic p-hacking signature in the p-value distribution, are highly problematic and specific indicators of intentional data manipulation or selective reporting. These actions directly address the accusations of \"data looking too perfect\" and \"key analyses being changed.\" The pressure Lena was under provides a plausible motive.\n\nConsidering the gravity and specificity of these pieces of evidence, particularly the modified preregistration and the p-value distribution, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is high.\n\n85"
