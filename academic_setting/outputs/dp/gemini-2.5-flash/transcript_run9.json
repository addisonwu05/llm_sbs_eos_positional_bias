The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Lab-wide practice for robustness:** The case explicitly states that this was \"as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" In good scientific practice, exploring robustness by testing different analytical choices (like exclusion criteria) is a legitimate and often recommended approach to ensure that findings are not sensitive to arbitrary decisions. If Lena is an honest researcher, she would be expected to follow and contribute to her lab's best practices.\n2.  **Consistency with peers:** The fact that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" further normalizes this practice. If this is standard operating procedure for students in Professor Mills' lab, then Lena, as a diligent student not engaged in misconduct, would naturally adopt the same practices.\n3.  **Demonstration of thoroughness:** From an innocent perspective, having and storing these alternative scripts demonstrates a thorough approach to data analysis, a commitment to exploring the data comprehensively, and an openness about the analytical process. It suggests an attempt to be comprehensive rather than trying to hide anything.\n\nTherefore, observing this specific pattern in Lena's logs is entirely consistent with, and indeed expected from, an innocent researcher working in a lab that promotes such practices.\n\n95"

Here's why:\n\n1.  **Adherence to Lab Norms as a Cover:** If Lena were committing misconduct, she would likely want her behavior to appear normal and above board to avoid suspicion. Since running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and \"other students in the lab show similar patterns,\" this practice would be a standard and expected part of her workflow. Deviating from this standard practice might actually raise more red flags than adhering to it.\n2.  **Facilitating Misconduct (Exploratory Data Analysis as a Pretext):** Even with falsified or fabricated data, a perpetrator might still run various analyses to determine the *most convincing* way to present their desired findings. They could use different exclusion criteria to \"optimize\" the p-values or effect sizes, essentially using the process of exploring robustness as a pretext for \"fishing\" for the most favorable presentation of their manipulated data. Storing these scripts would then just be part of the lab's standard documentation, providing a plausible, innocent explanation for exploring different analytical paths.\n3.  **Appearing Diligent:** A researcher engaged in misconduct might still want to appear thorough and diligent. Saving multiple scripts, even if some were used to find the \"best\" (i.e., most statistically significant) result from fabricated data, would contribute to an image of careful and comprehensive research, which is a common tactic to deflect suspicion.\n\nIn essence, this specific pattern of logging multiple analyses is a neutral action that can serve both honest scientific inquiry and, unfortunately, can also be part of a deceptive process while maintaining a facade of legitimate research. The fact that it's a lab-wide practice makes it a particularly convenient and expected behavior for Lena, regardless of her intent.\n\n90"

A researcher might typically adhere to high standards but succumb to pressure in a particularly stressful situation.\n2.  **Strategic Deception:** A person who plans to commit misconduct, or who finds themselves doing so, might be very careful to maintain a clean record in other areas or at other times. Having a strong, positive track record makes one less likely to be suspected initially and can lend credibility that allows misconduct to go unchallenged for longer. An independent data audit that her previous work passed would serve as strong evidence of her apparent integrity and competence.\n3.  **Learning/Evolution of Misconduct:** It's possible that if Lena did commit misconduct, it's a recent development. She may have genuinely conducted her prior research ethically and competently, and then, due to escalating pressure or opportunity, engaged in misconduct in this specific, high-stakes project.\n\nTherefore, a clean prior record and a history of good data practices are not incompatible with committing misconduct in a later, more pressured situation.\n\n75"

Similarly, a hard drive failure is a hardware malfunction, an unfortunate but common occurrence that is not caused by a user's ethical conduct. The IT department's confirmation further solidifies that this was a real event, not a fabrication.\n2.  **Mundane Explanations:** The case explicitly labels these as \"mundane explanations.\" This means they are common, everyday occurrences in a research environment. Their likelihood of happening is inherent to the operational realities of a lab and computing infrastructure, regardless of whether a researcher is honest or dishonest.\n3.  **Convenient Cover:** While these events are independent of misconduct, if Lena *were* committing misconduct, they would provide a very convenient and plausible explanation for any irregularities, missing data, or difficulty in reproducing specific steps. A software switch could explain format inconsistencies, and a hard drive failure could account for the loss of original, potentially incriminating, raw data or intermediate analysis files.

Excluding genuinely problematic participants (those who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions) based on contemporaneous notes is a universally accepted and expected practice in research. It contributes to the appearance of careful and diligent data management, which can help mask other, less legitimate, data manipulations.\n2.  **Strategic Removal of Noisy Data:** Even if Lena were fabricating or falsifying other data, removing genuinely \"bad\" data points (like those from participants who weren't engaged) would still be beneficial for achieving \"clean\" and statistically significant results.

This means some would naturally fall just below .05, but also some would fall just above .05. An absence of p-values just above .05 for *several* exploratory analyses is statistically improbable if the underlying results are genuinely marginal and reported without bias.\n2.  **Signature of Selective Reporting (P-hacking):** This specific pattern is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or \"selective reporting.\" This occurs when researchers make multiple analytical choices (e.g., trying different exclusion criteria, covariates, or outcome measures, as mentioned with Lena's multiple scripts) and then report only those analyses that yield statistically significant results, especially those that just cross the arbitrary .05 threshold. While not outright data fabrication, p-hacking is widely considered a form of questionable research practice, and often classified as academic misconduct because it misrepresents the statistical evidence.\n3.  **Inconsistency with \"Genuine/Unintentional Errors\":** If Lena's results are truly genuine and any errors are unintentional, her analysis and reporting should not systematically produce this skewed distribution.

This is a form of academic misconduct where researchers run multiple analyses, make flexible analytical choices (like different exclusion criteria as mentioned Lena did), and then report only those results that achieve statistical significance, especially those that just cross the arbitrary p < .05 threshold.\n2.  **Motivation:** The context explicitly mentions that Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review\" and Lena's paper \"reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and receives \"enthusiastic initial reviews.\" This creates a strong incentive for Lena to achieve statistically significant results, even if it means manipulating the analysis or selectively reporting findings.\n3.  **Means Available:** The information that Lena \"ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria\" provides the perfect mechanism for p-hacking. She could systematically try different analytical pathways until she found results that yielded p-values just below the .05 threshold, and then choose to report those \"clean\" results while disregarding those that fell just above the threshold.\n4.  **Fit with \"Too Perfect\" Claim:** The anonymous whistleblower's claim that some of Lena's data \"look too perfect\" aligns well with this specific p-value distribution. Such a distribution would indeed look \"too perfect\" to a statistically savvy observer, as it defies random chance for genuinely marginal effects.\n\nTherefore, this specific p-value distribution is not just consistent with, but is a direct manifestation of a common form of academic misconduct aimed at achieving publishable \"significant\" results.\n\n95"

This practice is specifically designed to prevent questionable research practices like p-hacking (adjusting analyses to achieve significance) and HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).\n2.  **Violation of Principles:** Modifying a preregistration *after* data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly contradicts the core principles of preregistration. Such changes allow researchers to retrospectively align their plan with observed results, undermining the transparency and credibility that preregistration aims to achieve.\n3.  **Inconsistent with \"No Misconduct\":** If Lena is genuinely innocent of academic misconduct, her actions would be expected to align with ethical and transparent research practices. Retroactively changing a preregistration to alter key analytical decisions (exclusion criteria, primary outcomes) is widely considered a severe breach of research ethics, often seen as a form of falsification or misrepresentation of the research process, and would itself constitute misconduct.\n4.  **Honest Deviations vs. Modification:** An honest researcher might, during the course of a study, discover a legitimate reason to deviate from a preregistered plan (e.g., unexpected data issues, new insights).

It's common to run preliminary analyses on a full dataset and then decide on specific exclusions for the final published analysis based on quality checks.\n4.  **Transparency of Backup:** The fact that this earlier version was \"recovered from an automated backup\" indicates it was not intentionally hidden or deleted. This suggests a natural evolution of the analysis rather than an attempt to conceal problematic exclusions.\n\nTherefore, this evidence is entirely consistent with an honest researcher refining their analysis plan and data cleaning process.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **very highly likely** that an earlier analysis script might include additional participants who were later excluded from the final dataset.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Exclusion as a Tool for Misconduct (P-hacking/Falsification):** One of the most common forms of academic misconduct, particularly p-hacking or data falsification, involves selectively excluding participants to achieve desired statistical outcomes. If Lena were trying to produce \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory\" and \"clean\" results under pressure, removing participants whose data did not support the hypothesis (e.g., were outliers in the wrong direction, weakened the effect, or made a p-value fall above .05) would be a direct means to that end.\n2.  **Iterative Optimization:** The fact that Lena \"ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria\" perfectly aligns with this. An earlier script might represent a stage before she identified which specific exclusions would optimize her results for significance. She could start with a larger dataset and then iteratively refine exclusion criteria to produce the most favorable outcome.\n3.  **Appearing Methodical:** Even a researcher committing misconduct would want their process to appear methodical and justifiable. Starting with a larger dataset and then applying \"justified\" exclusions (even if the *true* justification was to achieve significance) is a standard research practice that could be used as a cover.\n4.  **Automated Backup:** The fact that the script was \"recovered from an automated backup\" means Lena didn't intentionally delete this history. It simply reveals the chronological steps taken, which, in the context of misconduct, could easily include strategic participant exclusions.\n\nTherefore, the existence of an earlier script with more participants from which some were later excluded is not only consistent with misconduct but could be a direct consequence of Lena's attempts to manipulate the data to achieve desired results.\n\n95"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is high.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence and its impact:\n\n**Evidence strongly pointing towards academic misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Unusual p-value distribution (p-values just below .05, none above):** This is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It is highly improbable to occur naturally if effects are genuinely marginal. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this specific pattern is extremely unlikely (10%). If she did, it's very likely (95%) as it's a common outcome of trying to achieve significance.\n2.  **Preregistration document modified *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:** The purpose of preregistration is to prevent such post-hoc changes. Modifying it after seeing the data to align with favorable results is a direct violation of research integrity and itself constitutes misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this is extremely unlikely (2%). If she did, it's very highly likely (98%) as it's a way to legitimize altered analyses.\n3.  **Emails expressing high pressure and need for success:** Lena's statements (\"supervisor was counting on this study,\" \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") provide a strong, plausible *motive* for academic misconduct. While honest researchers feel pressure, these emails highlight the intensity that could push someone to cross ethical lines. If she committed misconduct, these are extremely likely (99%). If innocent, they are still very likely (95%), but they set a strong motivational context for misconduct.\n4.  **\"Data look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments\":** The whistleblower's claim aligns with the p-value distribution. Changes after reviews could indicate retrospective adjustments to satisfy critique or to enhance reported significance, potentially leveraging the post-hoc preregistration modification.\n5.  **Earlier script with more participants, later excluded:** While this could be innocent refinement, it also provides a mechanism for selective exclusion to achieve desired results. If she committed misconduct, this is very likely (95%).\n\n**Evidence that is more neutral or points towards innocence, but can be explained even if misconduct occurred:**\n\n1.  **Multiple alternative analysis scripts (lab-wide push):** This is presented as a lab-wide push for robustness. While a good practice, it also provides the perfect mechanism for p-hacking (trying various exclusion criteria until desired results are found).\n2.  **No prior record of irregularities, passed audit:** This is the strongest piece of evidence in Lena's favor, suggesting she has demonstrated good practices historically. However, misconduct can be situational, driven by specific pressures (like the current high-stakes grant review), and a clean record can serve to build credibility that masks later misconduct.\n3.  **Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure:** These are mundane and verifiable events that provide plausible, innocent explanations for some missing files or inconsistencies. However, they can also serve as convenient cover for any truly problematic missing data or irregularities if misconduct occurred.\n4.  **Legitimate exclusion of two participants with contemporaneous notes:** This demonstrates good data handling for specific, clearly problematic participants. An individual committing misconduct would still likely perform and document these legitimate exclusions to maintain an appearance of thoroughness and legitimate practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a prior good record and some issues have mundane explanations, the combination of the highly unusual p-value distribution, the clear breach of preregistration principles by modifying the document post-data collection, and the explicit strong motivation expressed in her emails strongly implicates her in academic misconduct. These specific pieces of evidence are very difficult to reconcile with \"honest mistakes or miscommunication\" and instead point to intentional manipulation to secure publishable findings under pressure.\n\n92"
