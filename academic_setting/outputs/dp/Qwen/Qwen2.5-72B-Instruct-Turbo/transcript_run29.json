When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This pattern of failures in similar conditions, coupled with the absence of clear evidence of rough handling by Alex or other employees, makes it more plausible that the printer in the small open-plan office also failed due to this known issue.\n\nTherefore, considering the documented history of failures and the lack of evidence pointing to improper handling, it is highly likely that the printer's failure is due to the known defect in the fuser unit.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

This suggests he is generally responsible and proactive, which reduces the likelihood that he would intentionally cause damage.\n   - Alex's email to facilities about the grinding noise and his pattern of reporting issues supports his credibility.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**:\n   - Jamie was seen pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, which could have contributed to the printer's failure. This provides an alternative explanation for the failure.\n\n3. **Building Access Logs**:\n   - Alex badged out of the office seven minutes before the critical error was recorded, which makes it less likely that he was directly responsible for the failure at that time.\n\n4. **Team Chat Post**:\n   - Alex's post about losing his temper with the printer could be seen as a threat, but it is also consistent with genuine frustration and typical office venting.\n\n5. **Coworker Observation**:\n   - A coworker saw Alex near the printer five minutes before it stopped working, which is a significant piece of evidence but not conclusive on its own.\n\n6. **Plastic Fragments**:\n   - The presence of plastic fragments similar to the broken tray in Alex's trash can raises suspicion but could also be explained by other factors, such as coincidence or other people using his trash can.\n\n7. **Printer Model Defect**:\n   - The known issue with the fuser unit and similar failures in other departments without evidence of improper handling suggest that the printer could have failed due to a mechanical defect.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the evidence is mixed. While some points suggest Alex might be responsible, others provide reasonable alternative explanations. The known mechanical defect and the actions of Jamie add significant uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alex broke the printer is moderate but not certain.\n\nProbability judgment: 50"
