The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the likelihood that she would have created notes excluding two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, and that these notes would predate the journal submission, is lower. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Timing of Exclusions**: If the notes predate the journal submission, it means that the exclusions were made before the final results were known. Intentional manipulation or fabrication would typically occur after data analysis to ensure that the results support the desired outcome. Pre-dating the notes would be more difficult and risky for someone engaging in misconduct.\n\n2. **Consistency and Plausibility**: Creating notes that appear credible and consistent with the rest of the data and documentation is challenging. If Lena were to fabricate these notes, they would need to align perfectly with the rest of the data and the study's protocol, which is not always easy to do without leaving traces of inconsistency.\n\n3. **Risk of Detection**: Intentional manipulation or fabrication carries a high risk of detection, especially if the notes are not well-integrated into the rest of the data. An internal inquiry would likely scrutinize these notes and the surrounding documentation, and any discrepancies could be identified.\n\n4. **Behavioral Patterns**: If Lena were engaging in misconduct, it is more likely that she would have made more subtle and less traceable changes to the data, rather than creating potentially detectable notes that predate the submission.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is relatively low.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"

This practice is common in scientific research, particularly in fields like cognitive neuroscience, where robustness and reproducibility are highly valued.\n\nHere are several reasons why this is likely:\n\n1. **Robustness Checking**: Running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria is a standard practice to ensure that the results are robust and not contingent on arbitrary choices. This helps in validating the findings and addressing potential criticisms.\n\n2. **Lab Culture**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that this is a common and accepted practice within the lab.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Plausible Deniability**: Running multiple analyses can serve as a form of plausible deniability. If Lena were to manipulate the data, having multiple scripts can make it harder to pinpoint exactly when and how the manipulation occurred. This can help her argue that any irregularities were part of a standard robustness check rather than intentional misconduct.\n\n2. **Consistency with Lab Practices**: Since other students in the lab also run and store multiple scripts, Lena’s behavior would blend in and appear consistent with the lab's norms. This makes it less likely to raise immediate suspicion.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks**: Engaging in multiple analyses can be a way to cover her tracks. If she manipulates the data, she can claim that she was simply exploring different criteria to ensure robustness, which is a common and accepted practice.\n\n4. **Reviewer Expectations**: Reviewers often expect to see robustness checks, and having multiple scripts can help address their concerns. If Lena is aware of this, she might create additional scripts to meet these expectations and make her results appear more reliable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this behavior can be a way to obscure misconduct, it is still a risky strategy.

It can happen for various legitimate reasons, such as the new software offering better features, improved support, or being more aligned with the lab’s evolving research needs. This is a normal part of the research process and does not necessarily indicate misconduct.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: Laptop hard drive failures are relatively common and can happen at any time, especially in a busy and high-stress research environment. The fact that the IT department confirms a hardware failure and repair around the time of the project adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n3. **Data Loss**: Data loss due to hardware failure is a known risk in research, and it is a standard practice to have backup systems in place. However, even with backups, some data can still be lost, especially if the failure is severe or if the backup was not recent.\n\n4. **Impact on Research**: The combination of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) can lead to some missing files and data, which would be a legitimate challenge for Lena to overcome.

However, if Lena were engaging in misconduct, she might use the switch as a cover to obscure any manipulations or fabrications. The transition period could provide opportunities to modify data or analysis scripts without immediate detection.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a legitimate and relatively common event. If Lena were committing misconduct, she might use this event to explain the loss of certain files, making it harder to trace any irregularities. The IT department’s confirmation of the failure adds credibility to this explanation, but it also provides a convenient excuse for any missing or altered data.\n\n3. **Convenience for Misconduct**: The combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure could provide a convenient cover for Lena to manipulate or fabricate data. She could claim that certain files were lost and that the switch to new software made it difficult to recover or verify the original data. This could help her avoid scrutiny or provide plausible explanations for any discrepancies.\n\n4. **Risk of Detection**: While these events can be used to obscure misconduct, they also carry risks.

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 suggests a pattern that is statistically unlikely to occur by chance alone.\n\n2. **Publication Bias**: While publication bias can sometimes lead to an overrepresentation of significant results, it is less likely to produce such a specific and narrow cluster of p-values just below the .05 threshold.

The fact that she expressed these concerns does not mean she would necessarily act unethically.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct is relatively high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the likelihood that she would write emails saying that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she “needs this one to work” is also relatively high. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Motivation for Misconduct**: The high stakes and personal pressures described in the emails provide a strong motivation for engaging in misconduct. If Lena felt that a null result would significantly harm her career prospects and that her supervisor’s expectations were high, this pressure could drive her to manipulate the data.\n\n2. **Rationalization**: Researchers who engage in misconduct often rationalize their actions by emphasizing the importance of the study and the personal consequences of failure. Lena’s emails might reflect this rationalization, providing a justification for her actions.\n\n3. **Documenting Concerns**: Writing such emails can serve as a way to document her concerns and the pressure she was under. This can be a form of self-protection, as it provides a record that might be used to explain or justify her actions if they are later discovered.\n\n4. **Seeking Sympathy and Support**: Lena might have been seeking emotional support and sympathy from her friend. Expressing the high stakes and her personal commitment to the study can be a way to gain understanding and support, which can be important when feeling under pressure.\n\n5. **Internal Struggle**: The emails might also reflect an internal struggle between her ethical standards and the pressures she was facing. This struggle can lead to a decision to engage in misconduct, even if it goes against her better judgment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did commit academic misconduct is relatively high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the likelihood that Lena committed academic misconduct is significant. Here are the key pieces of evidence and their implications:\n\n1. **Preregistration Document Modification**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious red flag. This suggests an attempt to align the results with desired outcomes, which is a common form of misconduct.\n\n2. **P-Value Clustering**: The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is highly suspicious. This pattern is indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, both of which are forms of misconduct.\n\n3. **Participant Exclusions**: The presence of additional participants in an earlier analysis script that were later excluded in the final dataset raises concerns. While legitimate exclusions are common, the combination with other red flags makes this suspicious.\n\n4. **Emails to a Friend**: The emails expressing high stakes and personal pressures provide a strong motive for misconduct. They indicate significant pressure to produce positive results, which can drive unethical behavior.\n\n5. **Data Management Logs**: The lab’s data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts, while not inherently suspicious, can be used to obscure misconduct. However, this is more of a concern when combined with other red flags.\n\n6. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab switching software and the hard drive failure can be used to cover up misconduct. While these events can happen naturally, they can also serve as convenient excuses for data manipulation.\n\n7. **Previous Audits and Credibility**: Her previous studies passing an independent data audit and being rated as well-documented and reproducible lend credibility to her, but they do not completely rule out the possibility of misconduct in the current study.\n\nGiven the multiple red flags and the combination of suspicious elements, the evidence points to a significant likelihood of academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"
