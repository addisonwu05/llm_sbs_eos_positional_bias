The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Researchers often exclude participants who do not follow the task instructions or who are not engaged in the experiment, as their data can introduce noise and reduce the validity of the results.\n\nThe fact that these notes predate the journal submission is a positive indicator that the exclusions were planned and not a post-hoc decision to manipulate the results. It's common for researchers to make such decisions during the data collection phase, often based on clear, predefined criteria for exclusion. This practice helps maintain the integrity of the study and the reliability of the data.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems relatively likely that the exclusion of these two participants was part of a standard, pre-planned data cleaning process, rather than an attempt to manipulate the results.

However, this would require careful foresight and a detailed understanding of the review process.\n\n2. **Consistency with Research Practices**: Excluding participants for not following instructions or for not being engaged is a common and valid practice in cognitive neuroscience. If the notes predated the journal submission, it suggests that these exclusions were part of the initial data cleaning process, which is a standard practice.\n\n3. **Hard Evidence**: The presence of notes that predate the submission provides strong evidence that the exclusions were planned and not a post-hoc manipulation.

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and a paucity of p-values just above .05 can suggest potential manipulation, such as p-hacking or data dredging.\n\n2. **Natural Variability**: In genuine data, p-values are expected to fluctuate naturally around the significance threshold.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that she would write emails saying that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she \"needs this one to work.\" Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **High Pressure and Motivation**: The high stakes described in the emails (the supervisor counting on the study and the impact on her postdoc chances) provide a strong motivation for misconduct. If Lena felt immense pressure to produce significant results, it could push her to engage in unethical behavior.\n\n2. **Emotional State**: The stress and pressure described in the emails could reflect a state of desperation or anxiety, which can sometimes lead to poor decision制作. If Lena felt that her career depended on the success of the study, she might be more likely to take risks, including manipulating data.\n\n3. **Justification for Actions**: Writing such emails can serve as a form of self-justification for misconduct. If Lena was already planning to manipulate the data, these emails could reinforce her belief that the misconduct was necessary due to the high stakes.\n\n4. **Internal Stress and Confession**: Sometimes, people who engage in misconduct might confide in trusted friends or colleagues about the pressures they are under. These emails could be a way for Lena to express her feelings and the reasons behind her actions, even if she is not explicitly confessing to misconduct.\n\n5. **Consistency with Other Evidence**: The content of the emails aligns with other pieces of evidence that suggest potential misconduct, such as the high concentration of p-values just below .05 and the post-hoc modifications to the preregistration document. This consistency makes it more likely that the emails reflect a genuine motivation for misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that she would write such emails.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is relatively high. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**: This is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or data manipulation. The unusual pattern of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold is a known red flag for misconduct.\n\n2. **Post-Hoc Modifications to Preregistration**: Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research integrity. This suggests a deliberate attempt to align the results with the desired outcomes.\n\n3. **Emails Expressing High Pressure**: The emails to a friend indicate significant pressure and motivation to produce significant results. While this alone does not prove misconduct, it provides a context that could lead to unethical behavior.\n\n4. **Data Management and Hard Drive Failure**: While a hard drive failure is a plausible technical issue, it can also be used to cover up misconduct. The combination of the software switch and the hard drive failure adds complexity to the situation but does not strongly point to misconduct on its own.\n\n5. **Previous Record of Integrity**: Lena's previous studies passing an independent data audit and being rated as well-documented and reproducible suggest a history of ethical behavior. However, this does not rule out the possibility of misconduct in the current study, especially given the high stakes.\n\n6. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running multiple analysis scripts is a common and legitimate practice, but it can also be used to cover up misconduct. The presence of these scripts alone is not conclusive but adds to the overall context.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of misconduct, particularly due to the strong indicators of p-hacking and the post-hoc modifications to the preregistration document. However, it is important to note that this is a complex situation, and further investigation would be necessary to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
