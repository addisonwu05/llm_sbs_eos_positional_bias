The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Given the information provided, it is important to consider several factors when evaluating the likelihood that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n1. **Past Record of Integrity**: Lena has a strong record of careful data handling. Her previous projects have been independently audited and rated highly, which suggests a pattern of consistent, reliable, and transparent research practices. If she had a tendency to manipulate or fabricate data, it seems unlikely that her earlier work would have maintained such a high standard.\n\n2. **Mistakes vs. Fraud**: Miscommunication and honest mistakes are common in research, especially with the complexities involved in data handling and software transitions. The fact that Lena has a strong record of adherence to good practices in the past makes it more plausible that any irregularities in this study could be due to honest errors rather than intentional fraud.\n\n3. **Lab Environment**: The lab's environment, including recent software changes and hard drive failures, can introduce variability and potential issues in data management. These factors can contribute to the appearance of irregularities without necessarily implying misconduct.\n\n4. **Consistency and Transparency**: Well-documented and reproducible research practices are hallmarks of a meticulous and integrity-driven researcher. Lena's previous work being rated highly in these areas suggests that she has a consistent approach to research that prioritizes transparency and accuracy.\n\n5. **Reputational Risk**: The high stakes of the current study, including the pressure to publish and the grant review, could be a significant motivator for misconduct. However, the fact that Lena's previous work was also conducted under similar scrutiny and passed muster suggests that she is likely to maintain her standards even under pressure.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is highly likely that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

Here are the key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Consistency in Misconduct**: If Lena engaged in data fabrication or falsification, it is reasonable to expect that such practices might have been present in her earlier work as well. Consistent misconduct would likely leave traces in the data and documentation that an independent audit would detect.\n\n2. **Skill in Deception**: While it is possible for someone to engage in misconduct and still manage to pass an audit, maintaining a high standard of documentation and reproducibility while also falsifying data is challenging. It requires a level of skill and care that is not common among individuals who engage in misconduct.\n\n3. **Audit Standards**: Independent data audits are typically thorough and designed to detect even subtle signs of irregularity. If Lena had a pattern of misconduct, it is likely that the audit would have picked up on inconsistencies or anomalies.\n\n4. **Reputational Risk**: Engaging in misconduct carries significant risks, including the possibility of being caught. The fact that her previous work was rated highly suggests that she was able to maintain a high standard of transparency and accuracy, which is less likely if she was consistently engaging in misconduct.\n\n5. **Internal Controls**: Labs and institutions often have internal controls and checks in place to prevent and detect misconduct. If Lena's previous work passed these controls, it suggests that her practices were likely above board.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is much less likely that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as! well-documented and reproducible if she did commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

Lena might have adopted this approach to align with lab norms and avoid drawing suspicion.\n\n3. **Technical Sophistication**: If Lena is sophisticated enough to engage in misconduct, she might also be skilled enough to create a trail of analyses that appears legitimate. This could involve running and storing multiple scripts to mimic the behavior of other researchers in the lab.\n\n4. **Consistency with Lab Practices**: Even if Lena is engaging in misconduct, maintaining consistency with the lab's standard practices can help her avoid standing out.

Modifying the preregistration document after data collection can be a strategic move to align the study's outcomes with the desired findings, such as achieving statistical significance or confirming the hypothesized effect.\n\n2. **Covering Tracks**: Changing the preregistration document can help to obscure the original plan and make it appear as if the final analysis was pre-specified, thereby reducing the risk of detection of post-hoc manipulations.\n\n3. **High Stakes**: Given the high stakes mentioned in Lena's emails, the pressure to produce significant results could drive her to take unethical actions, including modifying the preregistration document.\n\n4. **Risk of Detection**: While modifying the preregistration document is a serious ethical violation, it can be a calculated risk if Lena believes that the changes are subtle enough to avoid detection or if she has plausible explanations for the modifications.\n\n5. **Consistency with Misconduct**: If Lena did engage in misconduct, altering the preregistration document to fit the data would be consistent with a pattern of behavior aimed at achieving and maintaining desired results.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is quite likely that if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

Here are the key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomaly**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold and very few just above it is statistically anomalous and can be a red flag for p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation. This pattern is not typical of random data and suggests that the results may have been manipulated to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Exploratory Analyses**: While exploratory analyses can sometimes produce this pattern by chance, the absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly suspicious. In genuine exploratory analyses, one would expect a more random distribution of p-values around the .05 threshold.\n\n3. **Research Integrity**: If Lena did not commit misconduct, she would likely conduct her analyses with integrity, and the distribution of p-values would reflect the true variability in the data. Such a pattern of p-values is a strong indicator of potential bias or manipulation.\n\n4. **Lab Practices**: The lab's emphasis on robust and transparent research practices and Lena's previous record of careful data handling suggest that such a pattern would be highly unusual and unlikely to occur by chance.\n\n5. **Ethical Standards**: Researchers who adhere to ethical standards are less likely to engage in practices that result in such statistically anomalous patterns. The integrity of the research process is a fundamental aspect of ethical research conduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is relatively unlikely that if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

Here are the key factors to consider:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: One common form of misconduct is p-hacking, which involves manipulating data or analysis methods to achieve statistically significant results. This can result in an unusually high concentration of p-values just below the conventional .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Desired Results**: Given the high stakes mentioned in Lena's emails, the pressure to produce significant results could drive her to manipulate the data to ensure that p-values fall just below .05, thereby achieving statistical significance.\n\n3. **Statistical Manipulation**: Techniques such as cherry-picking data, excluding outliers selectively, or running multiple analyses and selecting only those that yield significant results can all contribute to this pattern.\n\n4. **Covering Tracks**: By ensuring that p-values are just below .05, Lena could make it appear as if the results are robust and significant, while minimizing the risk of obvious data manipulation that might be more easily detected if p-values were much lower.\n\n5. **Consistency with Misconduct**: If Lena did engage in misconduct, the pattern of p-values would be consistent with a strategic effort to achieve and present significant results, even if the original data did not support such conclusions.\n\n6. **Ethical Tension**: While this pattern is a red flag for misconduct, it is a plausible outcome if Lena was motivated to manipulate the data to meet the high expectations and pressures she faced.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is quite likely that if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is relatively high. Here are the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomalies**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and the absence of p-values just above .05 is a strong indicator of potential data manipulation or p-hacking. This pattern is statistically anomalous and highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Preregistration Document Modification**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant red flag. This suggests a post-hoc adjustment to the study design, which can be a form of misconduct.\n\n3. ** Emails to a Friend**: Lena's emails expressing the high stakes of the study and her personal need for it to succeed indicate significant pressure, which can be a motivating factor for misconduct. While pressure alone does not prove misconduct, it can create a context where unethical behavior is more likely.\n\n4. **Multiple Versions of Analysis Scripts**: The presence of multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, while not inherently indicative of misconduct, can be used to manipulate results. If these scripts were used to find the \"best\" results, it could be a form of p-hacking.\n\n5. **File Loss and Software Switch**: While a hard drive failure and software switch are common and not necessarily indicative of misconduct, these events can be used to cover up or explain away data manipulation. However, they are less strong evidence on their own.\n\n6. **Lab Environment and Pressure**: The high-pressure environment and the importance of the study for both Lena and her supervisor add to the likelihood of misconduct. The pressure to produce publishable findings can be a significant motivator.\n\n7. **Previous Record**: Lena's previous strong record of careful data handling and well-documented research practices does not rule out misconduct but makes it less likely. However, it is not impossible for someone with a good record to engage in misconduct under extreme pressure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the evidence suggests a higher likelihood that Lena committed academic misconduct. However, it is important to note that the final determination should be made by a formal inquiry with all evidence thoroughly evaluated.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
