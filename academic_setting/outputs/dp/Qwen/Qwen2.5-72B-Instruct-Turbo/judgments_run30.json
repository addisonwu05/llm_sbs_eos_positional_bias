  "Based on the evidence and the analysis, I think the probability that Alex broke the printer is moderate, but it is not a definitive conclusion. Given the mixed evidence, I cannot say with certainty that Alex broke the printer.\n\nHowever, if I must provide a clear answer based on the most likely scenario:\n\n**No**\n\n60% probability suggests that while it is possible, it is not a certainty. The evidence is not strong enough to conclusively determine that Alex is responsible."
