The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the likelihood of this occurring is generally lower compared to if she did not commit misconduct. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Covering Tracks**: If Lena were to fabricate or manipulate data, she might try to make the data and analysis look as plausible and standard as possible. Running and storing multiple scripts with different exclusion criteria could be a way to cover her tracks and make the analysis appear more thorough and robust.\n\n2. **Standard Lab Practice**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that this is a common and accepted practice. Lena might have followed these practices to blend in and avoid suspicion.\n\n3. **Pre-existing Norms**: If the lab has a culture of running multiple analyses as a routine part of data management, Lena might have continued this practice even while engaging in misconduct, as it would be expected and less likely to raise immediate red flags.\n\nHowever, if Lena did commit misconduct, the likelihood of her carefully maintaining and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts is lower because it requires additional effort and attention to detail, which might be less likely if her primary goal was to manipulate the data to get the desired results.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the lab’s data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, if she did commit academic misconduct, is around 40.\n\n40"

Pre-dating exclusion notes could be a way to cover her tracks, but it also increases the risk of detection if the notes are too detailed or specific.\n\n2. **Consistency with Good Practice**: Excluding participants who fell asleep or did not understand the instructions is a standard practice. If Lena were to engage in misconduct, she might still follow this practice to make her data and analysis appear more legitimate. However, the likelihood of her doing so in a way that is fully consistent with good practice and leaves a clear, pre-dated record is lower.\n\n3. **Risk of Contradictions**: Fabricated or manipulated data might lead to inconsistencies or contradictions that could be detected during a more thorough review. Pre-dating exclusion notes would need to align perfectly with other aspects of the data and analysis, which might be challenging to maintain if the data is being manipulated.\n\n4. **Motive and Opportunity**: If Lena had a motive to manipulate data, she might be more likely to alter the data itself rather than just the exclusion criteria.

This is a common occurrence in research, especially during multi-year projects where new tools and methods are continuously evolving.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: Hard drive failures are a relatively common issue in any setting where digital data is stored. The IT department confirming the hardware failure and repair is a strong indication that this was a genuine technical issue. Hard drive failures can lead to the loss of files, which is a known risk in data management.\n\n3. **Independent Events**: The switch in software and the hard drive failure are independent events. The fact that both occurred during the project does not necessarily imply any misconduct. It is possible that the software switch was planned and the hard drive failure was an unfortunate coincidence.\n\n4. **Impact on Data Management**: While the loss of files due to a hard drive failure can be problematic, it is a recognized issue in research data management. Researchers often have backup systems in place, but sometimes backups can fail or not be up-to-date, leading to the loss of some data.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is around 70.\n\n70"

This event is less likely to be directly related to misconduct, but it could be used to mask issues or confusion in data management.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a common technical issue that can happen independently of any misconduct. However, if Lena were engaging in misconduct, she might be more likely to use such a failure to cover up errors or data manipulation. The fact that the IT department confirmed the failure and repair is strong evidence that it was a genuine issue, but it doesn't entirely rule out the possibility that Lena might have exploited this event to her advantage.\n\n3. **Consequence of Misconduct**: While a hard drive failure can lead to missing files, the likelihood that Lena would use this failure to cover up misconduct is lower because it could also raise suspicion if the missing files are critical to the research. Additionally, if Lena were fabricating data, she might be more careful to ensure that her fabricated data remains intact and accessible.\n\n4. **Motive and Opportunity**: If Lena had a motive to manipulate data, she might try to create or exploit a technical issue to cover her tracks.

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomaly**: In a well-conducted study with no manipulation, p-values should be distributed more randomly around the significance threshold of .05. An unusual concentration just below .05 suggests that the data or analyses may have been manipulated to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Natural Distribution**: In genuine data, p-values should follow a uniform distribution if there is no effect, or a distribution that reflects the true effect size. A concentration just below .05 is highly unusual and suggests that some form of bias or manipulation is present.\n\n3. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to p-hacking because they involve multiple tests and the selection of significant results.

For example, a participant's data might be found to be incomplete or contain errors that were not initially apparent.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is around 70.\n\n70"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that an earlier analysis script including more participants would have certain participants excluded in the final dataset. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Manipulating Results**: Excluding participants post hoc can be a method to manipulate the data to achieve desired outcomes, such as achieving statistical significance. If Lena is engaging in misconduct, she might exclude participants who do not support her desired results.\n\n2. **Post-Hoc Exclusions**: Modifying the dataset by excluding certain participants after the initial analysis can help to produce more favorable results. This is a common tactic in p-hacking and data manipulation.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks**: By excluding participants in the final dataset, Lena might try to make the results appear more robust and reliable, covering up any manipulation or fabrication of data.\n\n4. **Strategic Adjustments**: If the initial analysis included more participants and the results were not as desired, Lena might strategically exclude certain participants to achieve the outcomes she needs. This can involve excluding participants with data that do not fit the desired pattern.\n\n5. **High Stakes**: The high stakes mentioned in Lena's emails (the importance of the study for the grant and her postdoc chances) provide a strong motivation for her to manipulate the data. Excluding participants can be a way to ensure the study \"works\" and meets the desired outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is around 85.\n\n85"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is relatively high. Here are the key pieces of evidence and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusual P-Value Distribution**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or selective reporting. This is a significant red flag.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious ethical breach and strongly suggests misconduct.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: The exclusion of participants in the final dataset, as documented in an earlier analysis script, could be a method to manipulate the results to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**: Lena's emails indicate high pressure and motivation to produce significant results, which could provide a strong incentive for misconduct.\n\n5. **Consistency in Previous Work**: While Lena has a strong record of well-documented and reproducible data in previous studies, the current evidence suggests a departure from these practices.\n\n6. **Data Management and Software Switch**: The lab's switch in software and the hard drive failure, while plausible, could be used to cover up issues if Lena were engaging in misconduct. However, these events are less directly indicative of misconduct on their own.\n\nGiven the cumulative weight of these factors, especially the unusual p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 75.\n\n75"
