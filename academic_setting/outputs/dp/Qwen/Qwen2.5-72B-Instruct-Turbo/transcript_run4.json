The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts could be a way to make her actions look more legitimate, but it also increases the risk of detection if the inconsistencies are too obvious.\n\n2. **Lab Practices**: If the lab has a strong culture of robustness and transparency, it might be more difficult for Lena to manipulate data without raising suspicion. Other students and the lab’s data management practices might serve as a check on her actions.\n\n3. **Mundane Explanations**: As mentioned, there are mundane explanations for the presence of multiple analysis scripts, such as exploring robustness and sensitivity of results.

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by weighing the various pieces of information:\n\n1. **Preregistration Modification**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which is a significant red flag and strongly suggests potential misconduct.\n2. **Emails**: Lena's emails express significant pressure and a strong need for the study to succeed, which could motivate misconduct.\n3. **P-Value Distribution**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above is a known pattern associated with p-hacking, indicating potential manipulation.\n4. **Data Exclusion**: The presence of earlier analysis scripts with more participants and the exclusion of certain participants in the final dataset is another red flag.\n5. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: While these can be explained by legitimate reasons, they add to the complexity and could be used to obscure misconduct.\n6. **Previous Record**: Lena's previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as well-documented and reproducible, which suggests a history of ethical behavior but does not rule out recent misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, the evidence points to a significant likelihood of misconduct, but it is not definitive. The strong indicators of potential misconduct (preregistration modification, p-value distribution, and data exclusion) weigh heavily, while her previous record and some mundane explanations (software switch, hard drive failure) provide some balance.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is 70.\n\n70"
