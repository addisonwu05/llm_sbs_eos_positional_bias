  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, I think the probability that Alex broke the printer is 55%. Given this moderate probability, I would not definitively conclude that Alex broke the printer, but there is a higher likelihood that he did compared to the alternative scenarios.\n\nHowever, to directly answer your question:\n\n**No**\n\nThe evidence is not strong enough to be certain that Alex broke the printer, and there are plausible alternative explanations for the failure."
