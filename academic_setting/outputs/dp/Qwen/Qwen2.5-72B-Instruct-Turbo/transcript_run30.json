The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This could be due to various reasons, such as a new grant requiring the use of specific software, a change in lab policies, or personal preferences of the lab members.\n\nA hard drive failure is also a relatively common issue, particularly in a research environment where data is frequently written and read. Hard drives can fail for a variety of reasons, including age, physical damage, or manufacturing defects. The IT department confirming the hard drive failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\nGiven the context:\n- The lab switching software is plausible and could happen for legitimate reasons.\n- A hard drive failure is a known risk in data management, and the IT department's confirmation supports this.\n\nIf Lena did not engage in academic misconduct, the combination of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) is not highly improbable, though it is not a routine occurrence.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: While switching software can happen for legitimate reasons, it could also be seen as a way to obscure or alter data. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have chosen a new software to manipulate data more easily or to hide traces of her actions. However, a lab-wide decision to switch software is usually a deliberate and documented process, which makes it less likely to be a cover for misconduct.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a plausible event, but it could also be used as a convenient excuse to hide data manipulation. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have fabricated or altered data and then used the hard drive failure as a way to explain missing files or inconsistencies. However, the IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure adds some credibility to this event, making it less likely to be a fabricated excuse.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did engage in misconduct, the combination of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) would still be possible but less likely, as they could be seen as convenient but not entirely necessary cover-ups. The hard drive failure, in particular, would be a significant red flag if misconduct was suspected.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would estimate the likelihood of these events occurring given that Lena did engage in academic misconduct as 40%.\n\n40"

It is possible that she started engaging in misconduct only recently, but this is less likely if she has a strong record of integrity over a longer period.\n\n2. **Independent Verification**: The independent data audit is a rigorous process designed to detect inconsistencies and irregularities.

This pattern is often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"data dredging,\" where researchers manipulate analyses or data to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Random Distribution**: In a well-conducted study, p-values should be randomly distributed around the significance threshold. The natural variation in data and the presence of noise should result in a more even distribution of p-values around .05, rather than a clustering just below it.\n\n3. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses often involve multiple comparisons, which can lead to some p-values being significant by chance.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would write emails expressing that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she “needs this one to work.” Here’s why:\n\n1. **Motivation for Misconduct**: The high stakes and personal pressure described in the emails provide a strong motivation for misconduct. If Lena was already considering or engaging in data manipulation, the pressure to achieve significant results would be a driving factor.\n\n2. **Expression of Anxiety**: Even if she was engaging in misconduct, Lena might still genuinely feel the pressure and anxiety described in the emails. These feelings are common and can be expressed to trusted friends as a way to vent and seek support.\n\n3. ** Rationalization**: Researchers who engage in misconduct often rationalize their actions by emphasizing the high stakes and the importance of the study. The emails could be a way of justifying her actions to herself and to others.\n\n4. **Covering Up**: While the emails might seem incriminating, they can also serve as a way to create a plausible narrative for her actions. If questioned, she might point to the high pressure and personal stakes as reasons for any irregularities in her data handling.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would write emails saying that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she “needs this one to work.”\n\nTherefore, I would estimate the likelihood of this scenario as 90%.\n\n90"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is relatively high. Here’s a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Preregistration Document**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a significant red flag and a common indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2. **P-Value Distribution**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05. This pattern is highly suspicious and often indicative of p-hacking.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: The earlier analysis script included more participants, but some were excluded in the final dataset. While this can be a standard practice, in the context of the other red flags, it raises concerns about selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Emails to a Friend**: Lena expressed significant pressure and high stakes in her emails, which could provide a strong motivation for misconduct. While this does not prove misconduct, it adds to the overall context of high pressure and potential rationalization.\n\n5. **Data Management Practices**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts is a standard practice, but in the context of the other red flags, it could be seen as a way to manipulate results and make the study appear robust.\n\n6. **Previous Record**: Lena’s previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as well-documented and reproducible. This suggests that she has a history of good data handling, which could argue against a pattern of misconduct. However, it does not rule out the possibility of recent misconduct under high pressure.\n\n7. **Lab-Wide Practices**: The lab’s data management logs show that running multiple scripts is a common practice, which adds some credibility to Lena’s actions. However, this does not negate the other red flags.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence strongly suggests that there are multiple indicators of potential academic misconduct. While there are some factors that could be interpreted as innocent, the combination of red flags makes it more likely that Lena engaged in misconduct.\n\nTherefore, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct as 70%.\n\n70"
