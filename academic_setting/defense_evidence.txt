The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.
Two participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.
The lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.
Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”
