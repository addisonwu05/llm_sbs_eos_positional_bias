When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The probability that Alex would behave this way if he didn't break the printer is around 75, and if he did, it's around 90.\n\n2. **Proximity to the Printer**: Alex was seen near the printer shortly before it failed. The likelihood of this happening if he didn't break the printer is around 70, and if he did, it's around 65.\n\n3. **Plastic Fragments**: Fragments similar to the broken printer tray were found in Alex's trash. The likelihood of this if Alex didn't break the printer is low (around 20), and higher if he did (around 80).\n\n4. **Timing of Departure and Failure**: Alex left the building 7 minutes before the printer failed. The likelihood of this timing if Alex didn't break the printer is around 90, and if he did, it's around 60.\n\n5. **Previous Behavior and Reporting**: Alex had previously reported issues with the printer and had a history of reporting broken equipment. The likelihood of this behavior if Alex didn't break the printer is high (around 95), and slightly lower if he did (around 70), as it suggests genuine concern or a attempt to deflect suspicion.\n\n6. **Jamie's Actions**: Jamie was seen pulling forcefully on a jammed paper in the printer. The likelihood of this footage existing is around 80, regardless of Alex's involvement.\n\n7. **Printer Model's History**: The printer model has a documented history of failing similarly in other departments. The likelihood of this being the case is around 95, regardless of Alex's involvement.\n\nConsidering these factors, the evidence against Alex includes being seen near the printer, having plastic fragments in his trash, and an initial denial of using the printer. However, his history of reporting equipment issues and the printer model's known problems mitigate against a high certainty of his guilt.\n\nThe presence of Jamie's forceful interaction with the printer and the printer model's history of failures introduce reasonable doubt about Alex's sole responsibility.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, a moderate probability seems reasonable.\n\n40"
