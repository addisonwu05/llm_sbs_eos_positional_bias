  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis, I think it is more likely than not that Alex broke the printer, but the evidence is not conclusive. However, given the summarized points and the probabilities, my judgment is:\n\n**Yes**\n\nThis judgment is based on the several pieces of evidence that suggest Alex's involvement, including his initial denial and later correction, the presence of plastic fragments in his trash can, and the timing of his departure. However, the known issues with the printer model and the actions of Jamie also introduce significant doubt."
