  "Based on the given evidence, I think the probability is about 50%, which means it is equally likely that Alex did or did not break the printer. Therefore, I cannot definitively conclude whether Alex broke the printer.\n\nHowever, if a decision must be made based on the available evidence, I would say:\n\nNo\n\nThis is because the evidence is not strong enough to confirm that Alex is the one who broke the printer, and there is significant evidence suggesting that the printer could have failed due to a mechanical defect or another user's actions."
