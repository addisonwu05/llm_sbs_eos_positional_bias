  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis, I think the probability that Alex broke the printer is 45%. This suggests that while there is a reasonable chance that Alex could be responsible, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. \n\nGiven the probability, I would state:\n\n**No**\n\nI do not think Alex broke the printer, but the evidence is inconclusive and suggests a significant possibility."
