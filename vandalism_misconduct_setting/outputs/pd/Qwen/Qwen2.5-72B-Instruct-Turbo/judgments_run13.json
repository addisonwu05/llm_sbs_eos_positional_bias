  "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Alex broke the printer is estimated to be 55%, which is slightly more than 50%. However, this is not a definitive certainty. \n\nGiven the mixed nature of the evidence and the known mechanical defects of the printer, it is a close call. Therefore, my judgment is:\n\n**No**\n\nWhile there are some indications that Alex might be involved, the evidence is not strong enough to conclude with certainty that he broke the printer. The known issues with the printer and the actions of other employees also play significant roles in the overall assessment."
