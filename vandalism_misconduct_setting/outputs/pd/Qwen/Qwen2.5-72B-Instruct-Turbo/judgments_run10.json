  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis, I think there is a slight indication that Alex might have been involved, but the evidence is not overwhelming. Given the mixed nature of the evidence, I would state:\n\n**No**\n\nWhile there are some suspicious elements, the known mechanical defects and the actions of other employees provide plausible alternative explanations for the printer's failure. Therefore, I do not have strong evidence to conclude that Alex broke the printer."
