  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe evidence more strongly supports that the printer failed due to its documented mechanical defect, potentially exacerbated by Jamie's rough handling. The timing evidence (Alex leaving 7 minutes before the error) creates a physical alibi, the printer model has a history of identical failures without mishandling, and Alex demonstrated responsible behavior by proactively reporting issues days earlier. While some circumstantial evidence exists against Alex, the combination of the badge records, known printer defects, security footage of Jamie's handling, and Alex's maintenance history collectively make it more likely this was a mechanical failure rather than damage caused by Alex."
