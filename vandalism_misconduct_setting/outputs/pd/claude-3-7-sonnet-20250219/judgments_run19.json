  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer. The preponderance of evidence suggests Alex was not responsible for the damage. The security footage showing Jamie roughly handling the printer, the documented history of this model failing in similar ways, Alex's departure from the building before the critical error occurred, and Alex's proactive reporting of issues three days earlier all point to alternative explanations. While some circumstantial evidence exists against Alex, the objective timeline and documentation more strongly support that the printer failed either due to its known mechanical issues or potentially from Jamie's earlier rough handling."
