  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence against Alex's involvement is the objective electronic records showing Alex badged out 7 minutes before the printer's critical error was logged. This timing, combined with the printer model's documented history of similar failures in other departments, strongly suggests a mechanical failure.\n\nThe security footage showing Jamie handling the printer roughly provides a more plausible alternative cause, while Alex's proactive email about the grinding noise days earlier demonstrates foresight rather than culpability. Alex's consistent history of properly reporting equipment issues further supports a pattern of responsible behavior.\n\nWhile some evidence appears suspicious (like the plastic fragments and Alex's inconsistent statements), these are outweighed by the stronger evidence pointing to a mechanical failure that occurred after Alex had already left the building."
