  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe most compelling evidence points to Alex's innocence: the objective badge records showing Alex left 7 minutes before the failure, the documented history of identical failures in this printer model, another coworker's observed rough handling, and Alex's established pattern of responsible equipment reporting. While some circumstantial evidence raises questions, the technical context and timing create reasonable doubt about Alex's culpability. The printer's known defects and failure patterns provide a more plausible explanation than Alex breaking it."
