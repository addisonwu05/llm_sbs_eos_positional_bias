  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe evidence points more strongly toward Alex's innocence than his guilt. While Alex was frustrated with the printer and was seen near it shortly before failure, several key factors suggest he wasn't responsible: he left the building before the critical error occurred, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling, Jamie was caught on camera roughly handling the printer, and Alex had previously tried to properly address the printer issues by reporting them to facilities. The plastic fragments, while concerning, weren't conclusively matched to the printer. Taking all evidence together, the printer's breakdown appears more likely due to either its known defective fuser unit or Jamie's rough handling than any action by Alex."
