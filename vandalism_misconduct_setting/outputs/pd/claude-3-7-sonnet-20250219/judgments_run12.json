  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer.\n\nThe strongest evidence against Alex's involvement is the timing - building access logs show Alex left the building at 5:12 pm, while the printer's error log shows the failure occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex departed. This creates a significant gap between Alex's last possible interaction with the printer and the actual breakdown.\n\nAdditionally, there are several compelling alternative explanations:\n- The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments without evidence of mishandling\n- Security footage shows Jamie handling the printer forcefully earlier in the day\n- Alex has a history of responsibly reporting equipment issues, including emailing about this specific printer making concerning noises days earlier\n\nWhile some circumstantial evidence exists (Alex's frustration, plastic fragments, inconsistent statements), these are outweighed by the concrete timing evidence and the established pattern of this printer model failing due to mechanical defects rather than mishandling.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the printer failed due to its known fuser unit issues, possibly exacerbated by Jamie's forceful handling of a paper jam earlier that day."
