  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I think the answer is: No\n\nWhile there is certainly suspicious evidence against Alex (the plastic fragments in his trash, his presence near the printer shortly before failure, his changing story, and his expression of frustration), there are also significant factors pointing to alternative explanations:\n\n1. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments without mishandling\n2. Jamie was captured on security footage roughly handling the printer\n3. Alex had proactively reported concerns about the printer days earlier\n4. Alex had already left the building when the critical error occurred\n5. Alex has a consistent history of properly reporting equipment issues\n\nWhen weighing all the evidence, I believe there is reasonable doubt about Alex's culpability, and the printer's failure can be plausibly explained by its known mechanical issues combined with normal wear-and-tear or Jamie's documented rough handling. While Alex may have been frustrated with the printer, the evidence isn't strong enough to conclude that he deliberately damaged it."
