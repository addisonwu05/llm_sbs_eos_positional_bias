  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, particularly the building access logs showing Alex left at 5:12 pm while the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm, combined with his proactive reporting of problems and the documented mechanical defects in this printer model, I conclude:\n\n**No**\n\nThe physical impossibility of Alex directly causing the failure after he had already left the building, along with the strong alternative explanations (known fuser unit defects, Jamie's forceful paper handling, and Alex's responsible reporting pattern), outweigh the circumstantial evidence pointing toward his guilt."
