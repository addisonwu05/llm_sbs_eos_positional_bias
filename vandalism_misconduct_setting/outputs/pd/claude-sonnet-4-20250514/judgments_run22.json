  "No.\n\nThe timing evidence is decisive - Alex badged out at 5:12 pm but the critical error wasn't logged until 5:19 pm, creating a 7-minute gap that makes direct causation highly improbable. Combined with his proactive maintenance reporting three days earlier, his history of responsible equipment reporting, and the multiple alternative explanations (Jamie's forceful handling, known fuser unit defects, similar failures in other departments), the evidence points more toward an unfortunate coincidence than intentional damage.\n\nWhile some evidence initially appeared incriminating (plastic fragments, contradictory statements, proximity to the printer), the totality of evidence - particularly the timing and his demonstrated pattern of trying to prevent equipment problems rather than cause them - supports his innocence."
