When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If Alex broke the printer, the seven-minute gap between his departure and the logged error, while possible, seems inconsistent with the witness seeing him near the printer \"5 minutes before it stopped working.\" This creates a timeline issue - either the witness timing is wrong, or Alex wasn't present when the actual failure occurred.\n\nHis behavioral pattern of responsible reporting strongly contradicts destructive behavior. Someone who emails facilities about preventive maintenance and has a history of proper reporting seems unlikely to suddenly resort to sabotage.\n\nThe systematic defect evidence provides a compelling alternative explanation, especially combined with Jamie's documented rough handling earlier that day.\n\nWhile the circumstantial evidence creates suspicion, the combination of the timing alibi, his responsible behavioral pattern, alternative causation (Jamie + systematic defects), and the technical evidence of widespread similar failures creates reasonable doubt.\n\n25"
