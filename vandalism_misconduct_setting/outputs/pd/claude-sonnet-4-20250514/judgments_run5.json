  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe Alex did not break the printer.\n\nThe key factors that lead me to this conclusion are:\n\n1. The 7-minute gap between Alex leaving the building and the printer's logged failure is inconsistent with physical damage, which should trigger immediate error detection.\n\n2. The documented history of identical failures in the same printer model without improper handling strongly suggests a systematic mechanical defect.\n\n3. Alex's proactive email three days earlier warning about the grinding noise and potential failure demonstrates genuine concern rather than planning.\n\n4. While the plastic fragments in his trash are suspicious, they can be explained by his attempting to clean up debris from the already-failing printer.\n\n5. His established pattern of responsible equipment reporting makes deliberate sabotage inconsistent with his character.\n\nThe evidence suggesting guilt (fragments, deceptive statements, proximity) can be explained by panic and coincidence, while the mechanical failure evidence provides a more coherent explanation for the printer's breakdown.\n\n**No**"
