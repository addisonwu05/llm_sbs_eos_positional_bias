  "No\n\nBased on the evidence, I believe Alex did not break the printer. The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Timing alibi**: Alex badged out at 5:12 pm, but the printer's critical error wasn't logged until 5:19 pm - he wasn't in the building when the system failure occurred.\n\n2. **Behavioral inconsistency**: Alex's proactive email warning about the grinding noise three days earlier and his history of responsibly reporting equipment problems contradicts a pattern of destructive behavior.\n\n3. **Alternative causation**: Jamie's forceful handling of jammed paper combined with the documented fuser unit defects in this printer model provide plausible alternative explanations for the failure.\n\n4. **Known defect pattern**: The technician's documentation of similar failures in two other departments without improper handling suggests this was likely another instance of the mechanical defect.\n\nWhile some evidence initially appeared suspicious (the plastic fragments, his frustrated comments, changing his story), the objective timestamp data and his established pattern of equipment stewardship more strongly support his innocence."
