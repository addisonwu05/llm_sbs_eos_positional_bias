  "No\n\nBased on the evidence, I believe Alex did not break the printer. The most compelling factor is Alex's proactive pattern of reporting equipment problems and specifically warning facilities three days earlier that the printer \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real.\" This behavior is fundamentally inconsistent with someone who would later intentionally destroy the same equipment.\n\nCombined with the documented systematic defects in this printer model, Jamie's forceful handling captured on security footage, and the fact that identical printers failed the same way in other departments without improper handling, the evidence points more strongly toward mechanical failure than deliberate sabotage by Alex.\n\nWhile some circumstances appear suspicious, they can be reasonably explained by Alex being a frequent user of failing equipment, normal workplace anxiety when questioned, and unfortunate timing coincidences."
