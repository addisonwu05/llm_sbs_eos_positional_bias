  "No.\n\nThe access logs showing Alex badged out at 5:12 PM, seven minutes before the critical hardware error was logged at 5:19 PM, create a physical impossibility. Alex could not have broken the printer if he was not in the building when the failure occurred.\n\nWhile there is circumstantial evidence that initially appears suspicious (plastic fragments, inconsistent statements, proximity timing), this cannot overcome the fundamental alibi provided by the access logs. The alternative explanations - Jamie's forceful paper handling, known mechanical defects in this printer model, and Alex's documented history of responsible equipment reporting - provide a more coherent explanation for the evidence."
