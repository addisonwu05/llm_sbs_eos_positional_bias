When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The fragments could have accumulated from any of Alex's previous interactions with the malfunctioning device.\n\n65"

The act of breaking the tray would almost certainly create debris, and someone trying to conceal their actions would naturally want to quickly dispose of evidence. The convenience and privacy of one's own desk trash can makes it a very probable disposal location. Even if Alex tried to be careful, small fragments could easily transfer to his person and later fall into his workspace.\n\nThe combination of physical necessity (debris from breaking plastic), psychological motivation (hiding evidence), and practical convenience (nearby disposal) makes this outcome highly probable.\n\n85"

However, if Alex did break the printer, this information actually provides perfect cover for his actions. A printer already prone to fuser unit failures would be an ideal target for someone wanting to cause damage that appears mechanical rather than deliberate.\n\nThe existence of systematic defects doesn't prevent Alex from being guilty - it might actually explain why the damage could be disguised as a routine mechanical failure.\n\n75"

The printer's established problems would naturally lead to multiple jam incidents throughout the day involving different users. However, if Alex did break the printer, Jamie's documented rough handling earlier that day would actually provide excellent cover for Alex's actions - creating reasonable doubt about the true cause of failure and giving Alex someone else to blame.\n\nThis footage might even make Alex more likely to act destructively, knowing there's already evidence of another person handling the equipment roughly.\n\n78"

Someone who emails facilities warning that equipment needs attention \"before it breaks for real\" and has a history of responsible equipment stewardship fits poorly with someone who would later destroy that same equipment.\n\nThe systematic printer defects and Jamie's rough handling provide plausible alternative explanations. The plastic fragments and proximity could result from Alex's frequent legitimate use of a failing printer.\n\nThe behavioral inconsistencies (initial denial, threatening message) could reflect anxiety from being suspected rather than guilt.\n\nWhile some evidence appears incriminating, the strongest and most psychologically consistent evidence points toward mechanical failure rather than deliberate destruction by Alex.\n\n35"

The most compelling factor is Alex's proactive pattern of reporting equipment problems and specifically warning facilities three days earlier that the printer \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real.\" This behavior is fundamentally inconsistent with someone who would later intentionally destroy the same equipment.\n\nCombined with the documented systematic defects in this printer model, Jamie's forceful handling captured on security footage, and the fact that identical printers failed the same way in other departments without improper handling, the evidence points more strongly toward mechanical failure than deliberate sabotage by Alex.\n\nWhile some circumstances appear suspicious, they can be reasonably explained by Alex being a frequent user of failing equipment, normal workplace anxiety when questioned, and unfortunate timing coincidences."
