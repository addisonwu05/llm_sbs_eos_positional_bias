When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Someone who emails facilities saying equipment \"might need a check-up before it breaks for real\" is demonstrating exactly the opposite mindset from someone planning to break it.\n\nThe plastic fragments and witness testimony are concerning, but they're also consistent with Alex being an unlucky frequent user who happened to be the last person near a printer that was already failing due to manufacturing defects and previous rough handling.\n\nThe manufacturing defect evidence provides a strong alternative explanation that doesn't require attributing malicious intent to someone with a documented pattern of equipment care.\n\nWhile some evidence points toward Alex, the combination of his responsible character pattern and the strong alternative explanations creates reasonable doubt.\n\n25"

His established pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems and proactively warning facilities about the grinding noise three days earlier is fundamentally inconsistent with someone who would deliberately damage office equipment. Combined with the documented manufacturing defects, Jamie's rough handling captured on camera, and multiple plausible alternative explanations for the failure, the evidence points more toward an unfortunate coincidence than deliberate sabotage by Alex."
