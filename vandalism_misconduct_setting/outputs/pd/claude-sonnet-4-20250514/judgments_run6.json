  "No.\n\nThe evidence against Alex, while suspicious on the surface, is outweighed by several key factors:\n\n1. **Strong alibi**: Building access logs definitively show he left 7 minutes before the critical hardware error occurred.\n\n2. **Pattern of responsible behavior**: His proactive email warning about the grinding noise 3 days prior, combined with his history of properly reporting equipment issues, contradicts the profile of someone who would sabotage equipment.\n\n3. **Alternative explanations**: The documented manufacturing defect affecting this printer model, combined with Jamie's forceful handling captured on security footage, provides plausible alternative causes for the failure.\n\n4. **Character evidence**: Alex's consistent cooperation with maintenance and proper use of reporting channels suggests someone who works within the system to solve problems, not create them.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in his trash and his presence near the printer are concerning, the combination of his absence during the actual failure, his responsible reporting history, and the known equipment defects creates sufficient reasonable doubt about his culpability."
