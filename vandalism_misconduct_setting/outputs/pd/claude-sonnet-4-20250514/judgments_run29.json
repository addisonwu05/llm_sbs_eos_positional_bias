While the proactive maintenance email complicates the narrative, the pattern of escalating frustration expressed in his team chat message, followed by the strategic timing of his departure just before the error logged, suggests someone who lost control despite previously trying to be helpful. The alternative explanations, while plausible individually, don't adequately account for the convergence of physical evidence and deceptive behavior that points specifically to Alex."
