  "**No**\n\nThe evidence against Alex, while circumstantially compelling, is outweighed by several key factors that suggest mechanical failure rather than intentional or reckless damage:\n\n1. **The 7-minute timing gap** between Alex's departure and the logged critical error is inconsistent with direct physical damage, which typically causes immediate failure.\n\n2. **Alex's proactive email** three days earlier warning that the printer \"might break for real\" demonstrates he was trying to prevent exactly what happened, contradicting sabotage intent.\n\n3. **The documented pattern** of the same printer model failing similarly in other departments without evidence of mishandling provides a strong alternative explanation.\n\n4. **Jamie's forceful handling** captured on security footage earlier that afternoon offers another plausible cause for the damage.\n\nWhile Alex's contradictory statements and proximity to the printer are suspicious, and the plastic fragments are concerning, these can be explained by his unfortunate timing as the last user of an already-failing machine. The evidence suggests Alex was likely present when accumulated mechanical stress (from known defects, Jamie's rough handling, and general wear) finally caused the printer to fail completely.\n\n**No**"
