  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe the answer is **Yes** - Alex broke the printer.\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors (his proactive maintenance email, the printer's known defects, Jamie's rough handling), the combination of the plastic fragments in his personal trash and his exclusive presence near the printer in the critical time window before failure creates too strong a circumstantial case to overcome. The physical evidence of fragments similar to the broken components being found in his workspace is particularly compelling and very difficult to explain through coincidence or alternative scenarios."
