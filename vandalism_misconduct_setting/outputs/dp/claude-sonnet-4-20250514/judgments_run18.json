  "No.\n\nThe evidence against Alex, while circumstantially compelling, is outweighed by several key factors:\n\n1. **Character evidence**: Alex's proactive email warning about the printer needing maintenance 3 days earlier, combined with his established pattern of responsible equipment reporting, strongly contradicts the profile of someone who would damage office equipment.\n\n2. **Timeline inconsistencies**: The badge log showing Alex left at 5:12 pm while the error logged at 5:19 pm creates reasonable doubt about the witness timing.\n\n3. **Alternative causation**: Jamie's documented forceful handling of jammed paper, combined with the printer model's known defect history, provides plausible explanations for the failure.\n\n4. **Behavioral inconsistency**: Someone with Alex's demonstrated track record of equipment stewardship breaking a printer would represent a significant departure from established patterns.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments and witness account are concerning, I believe the combination of Alex's proactive maintenance mindset, the timing discrepancies, and the available alternative explanations create sufficient reasonable doubt about his culpability."
