  "Looking at the totality of evidence, despite some factors that initially suggested Alex's innocence (his proactive reporting history and the printer's known mechanical issues), the combination of physical evidence and witness testimony is too compelling to ignore.\n\nThe plastic fragments similar to the broken tray found specifically in Alex's trash can, combined with a witness seeing him as the last person near the printer just five minutes before it failed, creates a very strong circumstantial case. These two pieces of evidence would require remarkable coincidences to explain if Alex were innocent.\n\nWhile his history of responsible equipment reporting gives me some pause, and the printer did have known defects, the physical and temporal evidence points directly to Alex's involvement in the breakdown.\n\n**Yes**"
