  "No.\n\nThe electronic timeline evidence showing Alex badged out at 5:12 pm while the printer's critical error was logged at 5:19 pm creates a fundamental obstacle to establishing his direct responsibility. While some evidence appears suspicious (inconsistent statements, plastic fragments, witness sighting), the objective electronic records strongly suggest Alex was not present when the failure occurred. The alternative explanations - Jamie's forceful paper handling, the documented fuser unit defects, and Alex's pattern of responsible equipment reporting - provide more plausible accounts for the printer's breakdown."
