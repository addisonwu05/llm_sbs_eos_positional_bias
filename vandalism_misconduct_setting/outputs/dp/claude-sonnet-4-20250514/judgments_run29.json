  "No.\n\nThe access log showing Alex badged out at 5:12 pm while the printer's critical error occurred at 5:19 pm provides a strong alibi that he was physically absent when the failure happened. Combined with his proactive email warning about printer problems days earlier and his consistent history of responsibly reporting equipment issues, the evidence suggests Alex did not break the printer. The documented fuser unit defects in this printer model, which caused similar failures in other departments, provides a plausible alternative explanation for the breakdown."
