  "Based on the synthesis of all the available evidence, I believe that Alex did not break the printer.\n\n**No**\n\nThe evidence is mixed, and while there are some suspicious elements (such as Alex's presence near the printer and the plastic fragments in his trash can), there are also strong alternative explanations, including the known issues with the printer model and the actions of Jamie. Alex's history of responsible behavior and his proactive reporting of issues further support the conclusion that he is less likely to have been the cause of the printer's failure."
