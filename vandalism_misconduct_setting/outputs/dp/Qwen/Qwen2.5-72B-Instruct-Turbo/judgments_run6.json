  "Based on the provided evidence and the analysis, I think there is a reasonable possibility that Alex broke the printer, but the evidence is not conclusive. However, if I have to make a binary decision, I would say:\n\nYes\n\nThis conclusion is based on the significant pieces of evidence pointing towards Alex, such as the plastic fragments found in his trash can and his presence near the printer shortly before it failed, even though there are alternative explanations and his history of responsible behavior."
