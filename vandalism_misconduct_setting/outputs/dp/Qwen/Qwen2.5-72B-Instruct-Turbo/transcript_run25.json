When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The fact that Jamie was seen tugging on a jammed sheet of paper does not necessarily contradict the possibility that Alex later caused the printer to fail.\n\nHowever, if Alex is responsible, the probability of this footage being present would be slightly lower, as it introduces an additional event that could independently contribute to the printer's failure.

This suggests he was aware of the problems and was proactive, which could be seen as inconsistent with intentional damage. However, it could also indicate frustration that might lead to accidental or intentional damage.\n\n2. **Timing and Badge Out**: Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm, seven minutes before the critical error. This timing makes it less likely that he was directly responsible, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that he caused the issue and then left quickly.\n\n3. **Security Camera Footage**: Jamie was seen pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, which could have contributed to the failure. This provides an alternative explanation for the breakdown.\n\n4. **Plastic Fragments**: The presence of plastic fragments similar to the broken tray in Alex's trash can is suspicious and could suggest involvement, but it could also be coincidental or the result of other activities.\n\n5. **Coworker Observation**: A coworker saw Alex standing next to the printer five minutes before it stopped working, which is a significant point of suspicion.
