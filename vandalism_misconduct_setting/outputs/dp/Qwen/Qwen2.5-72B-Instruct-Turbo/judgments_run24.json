  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, I think the probability that Alex broke the printer is 50%, which means it is equally likely that he did or did not break the printer. Given this 50% probability, I cannot definitively say whether Alex broke the printer. \n\nHowever, if I must state a binary answer, I would say:\n\nNo\n\nThis conclusion is based on the balance of the evidence, which includes significant doubts and alternative explanations for the printer's failure."
