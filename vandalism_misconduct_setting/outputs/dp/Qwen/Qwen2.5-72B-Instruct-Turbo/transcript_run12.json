When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Alex's proactive and prompt reporting of issues, including the specific instance of the grinding noise, suggests a behavior pattern that is inconsistent with someone who would recklessly or intentionally cause damage to the printer. If Alex did not break the printer, it is highly likely that he would have reported issues and cooperated with maintenance, as this aligns with his established behavior.\n\nHowever, while this behavior pattern supports Alex's claim, it does not definitively rule out the possibility that he was involved in the printer's breakdown. Other factors, such as the presence of plastic fragments near Alex’s desk and the fact that he was seen near the printer, complicate the situation. The known history of the printer model failing due to a defective fuser unit also introduces the possibility of a mechanical defect as the cause of the failure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the likelihood that Alex's behavior (reporting issues and cooperating with maintenance) would be as it is if he did not break the printer is high, but not absolute. Therefore, the probability that Alex did not break the printer, given his behavior and history, is estimated to be around 80%.\n\n80"

This suggests he was attentive to the printer's problems and not likely to cause them intentionally.\n2. **Building Access Logs:** Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm, seven minutes before the critical error occurred. This timing suggests he was not present when the printer failed, which is a strong point in his favor.\n3. **Printer Model's History:** The printer model has a known issue with its fuser unit and has failed in similar ways in other departments without evidence of improper handling. This suggests a high likelihood of a mechanical defect.\n4. **Security Camera Footage:** Jamie was seen pulling repeatedly and forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, and was the last person clearly visible using the printer before the failure. This suggests Jamie's actions could have contributed to the failure.\n5. **Plastic Fragments:** Small plastic fragments similar to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex's desk.
