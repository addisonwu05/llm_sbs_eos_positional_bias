  "Based on my analysis of the evidence, I believe Alex most likely did break the printer. The physical evidence of matching plastic fragments in his trash, the eyewitness account placing him at the printer just before failure, his contradictory statements about using the printer, and his documented frustration collectively suggest that Alex probably handled the printer roughly out of frustration, causing the damage. While there are some factors creating uncertainty (like the timing gap between his departure and the error message, and the printer's known mechanical issues), the weight of evidence points toward Alex being responsible for the printer's failure.\n\nYes"
