  "No, I don't think Alex broke the printer. The evidence indicates Alex had left the building before the printer failure occurred, as confirmed by badge records showing Alex departed at 5:12pm while the printer failed at 5:19pm. This timing, combined with the printer's documented history of similar failures in other departments and Alex's prior reporting of issues with the printer, suggests the failure was more likely due to the printer's known defective fuser unit rather than any action by Alex."
