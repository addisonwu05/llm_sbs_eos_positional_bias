  "No, I do not think Alex broke the printer. \n\nThe evidence points more strongly toward the printer failing due to its documented defect rather than Alex breaking it. The most compelling factors are that Alex badged out of the building at 5:12pm while the printer didn't fail until 5:19pm, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments, and Alex had previously reported concerns about the printer's condition. While some circumstantial evidence like the plastic fragments is concerning, the timing discrepancy and the printer's known issues provide a more plausible explanation for the failure."
