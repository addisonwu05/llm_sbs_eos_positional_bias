  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe there is sufficient reason to doubt Alex's responsibility while also acknowledging the evidence against him. The timeline discrepancy (Alex leaving 7 minutes before the failure), the printer's documented history of identical failures in other departments, and Jamie's rough handling provide reasonable alternative explanations. While the plastic fragments in Alex's trash are concerning, they aren't definitively matched to the printer. Given these significant uncertainties and the principle that conclusions should be supported by clear evidence, I cannot confidently determine that Alex broke the printer.\n\nNo"
