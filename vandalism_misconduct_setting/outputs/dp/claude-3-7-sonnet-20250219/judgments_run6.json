  "No.\n\nWhile there's circumstantial evidence against Alex (plastic fragments, proximity to the printer before failure, and inconsistent statements), there are also significant alternative explanations:\n\n1. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures without improper handling\n2. Jamie was caught on camera roughly handling the printer shortly before failure\n3. Alex had already left the building when the critical error occurred\n4. Alex had previously reported concerns about the printer's condition\n\nThe physical timing (Alex leaving before the failure) combined with the printer's known defect history and Jamie's documented rough handling create reasonable doubt about Alex's direct responsibility. While Alex's behavior raises questions, the evidence doesn't conclusively establish that he caused the critical failure."
