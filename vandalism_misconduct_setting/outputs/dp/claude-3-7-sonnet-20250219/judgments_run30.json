  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe the answer is:\n\nYes\n\nWhile there are some factors suggesting Alex's innocence (like the printer's documented history of failures and his prior responsible behavior), the weight of evidence points toward Alex breaking the printer. The physical evidence of matching fragments in his trash, his expressed frustration, his presence at the printer just before it failed, his inconsistent statements about using it, and the tight timeline between his departure and the failure collectively create a compelling case that Alex likely damaged the printer before leaving the office."
