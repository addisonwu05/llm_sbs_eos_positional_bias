  "Based on the balance of evidence presented, my assessment is:\n\nNo\n\nWhile there is certainly some evidence pointing to Alex's involvement (the plastic fragments, his frustration message, and being seen near the printer), several key factors create reasonable doubt:\n\n1. The badge records show Alex left before the printer failure\n2. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures without mishandling\n3. Another employee (Jamie) was seen handling the printer roughly\n4. Alex had previously reported the printer issues, showing responsibility\n5. The physical evidence is circumstantial and not conclusively matched to the printer\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that while Alex could have been involved, the natural mechanical failure explanation seems more likely given the printer's known issues and the timeline discrepancy with Alex's departure."
