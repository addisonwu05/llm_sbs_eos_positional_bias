  "No. While there is some evidence suggesting Alex might have been involved, there are several critical factors that point away from Alex's responsibility:\n\n1. The timing discrepancy is significant - Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, but the printer failure occurred at 5:19 pm, making it physically impossible for Alex to have caused the final failure.\n\n2. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments without mishandling, pointing to an inherent mechanical defect.\n\n3. Alex proactively reported grinding noises from the printer three days earlier and has a consistent history of responsibly reporting equipment issues.\n\n4. Security footage shows another employee (Jamie) handling the printer roughly earlier in the day.\n\nWhile the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and his inconsistent statements raise questions, these can be explained by earlier interaction with a printer that was already failing. The evidence, taken together, suggests the printer likely failed due to its known mechanical issues rather than due to Alex's actions."
