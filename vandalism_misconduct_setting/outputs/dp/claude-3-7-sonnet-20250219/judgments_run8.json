  "Based on my assessment of all the evidence, I believe:\n\nNo\n\nWhile there are suspicious elements like the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and his presence near the printer shortly before failure, the timing evidence showing the printer failed 7 minutes after Alex had already left the building creates reasonable doubt. This, combined with the printer's documented history of similar failures in other departments and Alex's proactive reporting of issues beforehand, suggests the printer likely failed due to its known mechanical defect rather than through Alex's actions."
