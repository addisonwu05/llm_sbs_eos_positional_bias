  "No.\n\nWhile there is circumstantial evidence suggesting Alex's involvement (like the plastic fragments in his trash and his presence near the printer shortly before failure), several factors create reasonable doubt:\n\n1. The timing discrepancy is significant - Alex badged out 7 minutes before the printer failed, creating a gap between his departure and the breakdown\n2. The printer model has a documented history of failing due to defective fuser units, with similar failures in other departments\n3. Alex proactively reported the printer's grinding noise three days earlier, which is inconsistent with someone planning to damage it\n4. Security footage shows Jamie forcefully handling the printer earlier that day\n5. Alex's history of properly reporting equipment issues suggests responsible behavior\n\nThese factors, particularly the timing discrepancy between Alex's departure and the printer failure combined with the printer's known defect issues, make it more likely that the printer failed due to mechanical problems rather than Alex's actions. While Alex's changed story and the plastic fragments are concerning, they don't overcome these other significant factors pointing to his innocence."
