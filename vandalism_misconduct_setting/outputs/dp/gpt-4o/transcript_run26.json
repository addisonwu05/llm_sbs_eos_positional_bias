When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The footage showing Jamie tugging on a jammed sheet of paper supports the possibility that the printer was already experiencing issues before Alex's involvement.\n\n2. **Printer's History**: The background information about the printer model's known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit suggests that this breakdown could be unrelated to user handling. If the printer was already malfunctioning, it may have jammed easily, leading Jamie to pull on the paper more forcefully.\n\n3. **Probability of Jamie's Actions Being Recorded**: Given that the printer was having issues throughout the day, it's not unlikely that someone would interact with it in a visible manner. The security camera footage just happening to catch Jamie in a moment of struggle with the printer does not detract significantly from the possibility that the issues were mechanical.\n\nIn summary, given the known problems with this printer model and the sequence of events, it is reasonably likely that Jamie's actions would have been recorded if Alex did not cause the printer's failure. The footage fits into the narrative where the printer was already malfunctioning, and Jamie's interaction may have been part of ongoing incidents throughout the day.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 75"

It is plausible that the printer jammed earlier, prompting Jamie to interact with it, even if Alex later exacerbated the issue.\n\n2. **Multiple Interactions**: Given the context of a busy office environment and Alex's complaints about the printer jamming repeatedly, it is reasonable to assume that multiple people could have faced issues with the printer. Jamie's earlier interaction might have been an independent incident or a contributing factor to the printer being in a fragile state before Alex's alleged involvement.\n\n3. **Routine Malfunctions**: Jamie's actions on the footage do not necessarily indicate that Jamie caused any subsequent critical error. It is possible that both Jamie and Alex encountered mechanical issues, with Alex's later interaction being the one that led to the printer stopping completely.\n\nConsidering these points, even if Alex was ultimately responsible for the breakdown, it is likely that issues with the printer led to Jamie's earlier interaction, resulting in the footage capturing her actions.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 65"
