When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This timeline suggests that Alex was not present at the time of the error, making it unlikely they were directly responsible for the issue occurring at that moment.\n\n2. **Security Footage**: There is footage of another coworker, Jamie, handling a paper jam earlier in the afternoon. This might have contributed to the printer's eventual failure.\n\n3. **Defective Printer History**: The technician has noted this printer model's known issues, indicating the breakdown could have resulted from an existing mechanical defect rather than user handling.\n\n4. **Plastic Fragments**: While plastic fragments were found in Alex’s trash, without more information, it is unclear whether these fragments are related to the printer's malfunction.\n\nConsidering these factors, the likelihood that Alex did not break the printer and just happened to leave the building before the error can be reasonably considered as relatively high. The evidence does not conclusively point to Alex being responsible for the malfunction, particularly because they were not present when the error occurred.\n\nOverall, the probability that Alex left the building before the printer error is legitimate and unconnected to any actions that caused the failure is reasonably high.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 85"

Some types of damage might not cause immediate failure but instead cause subsequent errors as the printer continues to be used.\n\n2. **Circumstances**: Alex's prior complaints and frequent use of the printer could suggest a scenario where he might have been frustrated enough to tamper with it, although this is speculative without direct evidence of such intent.\n\n3. **Mechanical Delay**: It's conceivable that if Alex physically damaged a part of the printer (e.g., by jamming something or dislodging a component), the machine might continue semi-functional operation until further use exacerbated the condition, leading to a delayed critical error.\n\nConsidering these points, while possible, it's still relatively unlikely for someone to deliberately break something and then have the malfunction occur after their departure, unless they specifically intended for a delayed effect.
