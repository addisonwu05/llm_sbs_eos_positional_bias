When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The printer model's documented history of failing due to a defective fuser unit suggests it is prone to breakdowns under regular conditions. Since the same model has failed in a similar manner in two other departments within six months, and in those cases, no evidence of improper handling was found, it indicates a consistent pattern of malfunction attributed to the inherent defect.\n\nIf Alex did not cause the printer to break, the probability that the printer model's failure occurred due to the documented defect, independent of any user's misuse, appears to be quite significant. This is especially relevant given the model's track record and the technician's note about the fuser unit issue. Although exact statistics on the failure rates of such models in offices aren't provided, the recurring nature of these defects as highlighted by prior instances increases the likelihood that this event resulted from a similar cause.\n\nGiven the evidence pointing towards a pattern of this printer model failing without improper handling, the probability that this breakdown is explained by the model's history and documented defect, rather than Alex's actions, is relatively high. Therefore, considering all these factors, a reasonable probability judgment for the printer having failed due to the known defect rather than Alex's actions is:\n\n85"
