When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Another possibility is that Alex's actions somehow set off a chain of events that eventually led to the error, but with a delay.\n\nHowever, if Alex deliberately or recklessly damaged the printer, the coincidence of leaving shortly before the error becomes more unlikely, since one might expect the error to occur immediately due to the direct action. The seven-minute gap could be possible if the damage caused by Alex was not immediately apparent or took time to affect the printer's operation critically.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the timing does not make it impossible that Alex broke the printer, it does make it less probable that a direct action would result in a delayed error unless it was non-immediate damage.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
