When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The fact that similar models in other departments have failed in the past six months without any evidence of improper handling supports the notion that these failures might be attributed to an inherent defect rather than user error. This background information suggests that if Alex did not break the printer, it is plausible that the failure could occur under normal usage due to the defective fuser unit.\n\nWhen assessing how likely it is that a documented history of failure exists for this printer model without evidence of improper handling, we can use the past incidents in other departments as a reference. Since these incidents occurred \"in a similar way\" without evidence of user fault, it indicates a pattern consistent with the printer's mechanical issues rather than misuse.\n\nConsidering that the fuser defect is known and other identical printers have failed similarly, it seems fairly likely that such failures could occur independently of user actions. \n\nThus, if Alex did not break the printer due to mishandling, the probability that the printer failed due to its documented issues, independent of improper handling, would be relatively high. \n\nTherefore, the judgment of how likely it is that this printer model would have a documented history of failures without evidence of improper handling, assuming Alex did not cause the failure, is approximately:\n\n80"
