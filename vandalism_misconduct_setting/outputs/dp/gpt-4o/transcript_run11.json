When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The intent behind emailing facilities indicates a desire to prevent breakdowns and facilitate smooth operations, typical of an employee who is cognizant of potential mechanical issues and wishes to avert them rather than exacerbate them.\n\nGiven Alex's history of promptly addressing issues with equipment and communicating these concerns, the likelihood that he would have reported the grinding noise days earlier, despite having no involvement in breaking the printer, is high. His actions are consistent with an attentive and conscientious employee rather than someone who would negligently or recklessly cause a breakdown.\n\nTaking into account the information and Alex's behavioral pattern, it is likely that his actions of reporting align with someone who did not cause the breakdown intentionally or recklessly.\n\nThus, if Alex did not break the printer, the likelihood that he would have emailed about the grinding noise beforehand and have a history of reporting issues is quite high.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

Typically, if someone were prone to damaging equipment through negligence or intention, they might not focus as much on reporting issues ahead of time or have a consistent history of cooperation with maintenance unless their actions were carefully calculated to avoid suspicion.\n\nHowever, one could argue that reporting issues in advance could be a tactic used to deflect suspicion in the case where Alex did indeed cause the damage. But this would require a level of forethought and manipulation that may not align with his established pattern of being the first to report issues and cooperate transparently with maintenance.\n\nAlex’s previous behavior of promptly reporting and addressing issues tends to contradict the notion of him intentionally or recklessly causing the damage in a premeditated manner. This history of responsible behavior is generally more characteristic of someone who wants to ensure proper functioning of equipment rather than contribute to its failure, even if indirectly.\n\nTherefore, while it isn’t impossible for someone to use prior good behavior as a cover, the patterns in Alex’s actions suggest that, if he did break the printer, it would be unusual for him to have consistently reported problems as diligently as he has in the past. This prior pattern weakens the likelihood of him having intentionally or recklessly caused the breakdown.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

In an environment where multiple individuals use the same equipment, it's not uncommon for different users to handle issues like paper jams in various ways, which can add to the wear and tear of a device.\n\nIf Alex was responsible for breaking the printer, Jamie's actions caught on camera might be coincidental or part of a series of interactions that cumulatively led to the breakdown. It's possible that the forceful handling by Jamie exacerbated an existing minor issue, which Alex could have later worsened or that Alex took actions after Jamie's interaction that directly caused the failure.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of the footage showing Jamie handling the printer forcefully, irrespective of Alex's involvement, remains moderately high since multiple factors could be contributing to the scenario. The presence of this footage does not necessarily negate the possibility of Alex causing damage later—it simply reflects the shared use of the printer leading up to the failure.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
