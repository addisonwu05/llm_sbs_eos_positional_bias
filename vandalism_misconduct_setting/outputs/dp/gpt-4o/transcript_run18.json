When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The email about the grinding noise and the history of reporting issues could be seen as an effort to preemptively protect themselves from suspicion in the event of a breakdown. However, this assumes a level of foresight and intentionality that may not be typical unless there is a specific motive or context for Alex to want to damage the printer.\n\nAlternatively, Alex's history of reporting broken equipment and taking proactive steps suggests they value maintaining functional office equipment. This pattern does not intuitively align with intentionally breaking the printer, unless the act was accidental and Alex became aware of it only after the fact.\n\nWhile it's possible for someone to damage something they previously reported due to negligence or frustration, the established history of conscientious behavior leans more toward the incident being unintended if Alex is responsible. Overall, the presence of a prior pattern and the email could still occur if Alex had broken the printer, but it might be less consistent with an intentional or reckless act of damage.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
