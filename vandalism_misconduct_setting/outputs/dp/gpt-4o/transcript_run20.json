Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The timeline shows Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, while the critical error occurred at 5:19 pm. This time gap of seven minutes suggests that Alex physically leaving the building makes it unlikely for them to have caused the critical hardware error precisely at the time it was recorded. \n\nAdditionally, there are other factors to consider. Jamie was seen pulling forcefully on jammed paper earlier, which could have contributed to the printer's eventual failure. The technician also pointed out that the printer model is known to have issues with a defective fuser unit. Both these points provide plausible alternative explanations for the breakdown that do not involve Alex.\n\nThe small plastic fragments found in the trash under Alex's desk could raise suspicion, but without definitive evidence connecting those specific fragments to the printer's critical error, they are insufficient to conclude culpability. It is possible these fragments could be from something unrelated.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is entirely possible for Alex to have inadvertently contributed to the eventual failure through earlier actions, the most immediate evidence—Alex's departure and the error log timing—argues against them being directly responsible for the crash occurring when it did.\n\nThus, if Alex did not directly break the printer, the probability that they badged out of the building before the error recorded in the printer's log aligns with this scenario seems reasonably high.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

First, causing such a precisely timed failure would require considerable technical knowledge and intent. Furthermore, Alex had previously reported issues with the printer jamming, indicating a level of frustration with the device. While this might provide a motive, it does not necessarily imply the capability to orchestrate a delayed failure.\n\nThe presence of other plausible causes for the failure, such as prior rough handling by another employee (Jamie) and known mechanical defects, also makes it less plausible that Alex could confidently anticipate a failure exactly seven minutes after leaving.\n\nTaking these considerations into account, it's less probable that Alex would badge out purposefully seven minutes before a failure they caused in a premeditated way, making this timing appear coincidental rather than intentional.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"
