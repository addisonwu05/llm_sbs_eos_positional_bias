When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

This behavior aligns with being a responsible employee.\n\nConsidering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if Alex did not break the printer, it is likely that he would still have emailed about the issue and continued his pattern of behavior regarding reporting broken equipment.\n\nThe probability that Alex would have emailed facilities about the grinding noise and had a prior pattern of promptly reporting broken equipment if he did not break the printer is relatively high because it aligns with his demonstrated behavior pattern.\n\n85"

This could indicate either a genuine memory lapse or an attempt to distance himself from the incident.\n\n2. **Physical evidence**: Plastic fragments similar to the broken printer tray were found in Alex's trash can. This is potentially incriminating, as it suggests Alex might have been involved in the printer's failure.\n\n3. **Circumstantial evidence**: Alex was seen near the printer shortly before it failed, and no one else was observed approaching it during that interval. This could imply that Alex was the last person to interact with the printer.\n\n4. **Alex's prior behavior and statements**: Alex had previously complained about the printer jamming and expressed frustration. This could be seen as either a genuine reaction or a potential setup to deflect blame.\n\n5. **Alternative explanations and evidence**: The printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and another coworker, Jamie, was seen pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper, which could have contributed to the failure.\n\nConsidering these factors:\n\n- The presence of plastic fragments in Alex's trash can is a strong indicator of his involvement.\n- Alex's initial denial and later correction could suggest an attempt to downplay his involvement.\n- The fact that Alex was seen near the printer before it failed adds to the suspicion.\n- However, the printer model's known issues and Jamie's interaction with the printer provide alternative explanations for the failure.\n\nGiven the evidence, while there are indications that point towards Alex's potential involvement (such as the plastic fragments and his presence near the printer), there are also plausible alternative explanations for the printer's failure (the printer model's defects and Jamie's actions).\n\nSynthesizing these, I would assess the probability that Alex broke the printer as follows:\n\n60"
