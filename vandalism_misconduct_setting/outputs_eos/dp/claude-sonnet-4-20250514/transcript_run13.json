    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This creates reasonable doubt about Alex's direct involvement in the breakdown.\n\nThe security footage showing Jamie forcefully pulling on jammed paper earlier that afternoon suggests there was rough handling by someone else that could have contributed to or caused the eventual failure.\n\nAlex's proactive email three days earlier warning about grinding noises and suggesting maintenance demonstrates responsible behavior rather than destructive intent. His history of promptly reporting equipment problems further supports his reliability and concern for office equipment.\n\nThe printer model having a documented pattern of similar failures in other departments without evidence of improper handling indicates this could be a mechanical defect rather than user-caused damage.\n\nThe plastic fragments under Alex's desk remain unexplained, but given Alex's absence during the actual failure time and the multiple alternative explanations for the breakdown, this evidence alone is insufficient to establish causation.\n\nThe combination of Alex's physical absence during the failure, evidence of another person's forceful handling, the printer's known defect history, and Alex's responsible reporting pattern creates a coherent narrative where Alex is not responsible for the breakdown.\n\n85"

An innocent person being the last one near a device right before it fails is possible but suspicious.\n\nThe team chat post about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again could be innocent frustration, but the timing and language create an unfortunate appearance if he's later suspected of breaking it.\n\nFinding plastic fragments similar to the broken tray under his desk would be extremely coincidental if he didn't break it. How would those specific fragments end up there innocently?\n\nHis initial denial of using the printer, followed by uncertainty about printing \"something quickly this morning,\" suggests either poor memory or potential deception. If innocent, why the inconsistent story about basic printer usage?\n\nThe combination of being the last person seen at the printer, expressing frustration that could be interpreted as a threat, having physical evidence under his desk, and giving inconsistent accounts creates a pattern that would be highly unlikely to occur by chance if Alex were completely innocent.\n\nWhile each element individually might have an innocent explanation, the convergence of all these factors pointing toward Alex would represent an extraordinary coincidence.\n\n15"
