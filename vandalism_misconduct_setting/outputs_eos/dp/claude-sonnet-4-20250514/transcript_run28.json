    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

His history of promptly reporting equipment problems further supports his character.\n\nThe documented defective fuser unit issue affecting the same printer model in two other departments shows this was a systemic mechanical problem, not necessarily caused by user error.\n\nThe plastic fragments under Alex's desk could easily be explained by normal printer maintenance or previous interactions, and don't necessarily indicate destructive behavior.\n\nAll of this evidence is highly consistent with Alex being innocent - the timing alone provides a strong alibi, while the other factors support alternative explanations and demonstrate Alex's responsible approach to equipment issues.\n\n85"

This suggests either delayed failure from damage he caused, or that the timing is coincidental.\n\nIf Alex broke it, the security footage of Jamie pulling forcefully on paper earlier could be unrelated, or Jamie's actions might have been the final trigger for damage Alex had already caused.\n\nThe documented fuser unit defects in other departments could be coincidental - Alex's destructive actions might have simply accelerated an inevitable failure.\n\nHis proactive email about the grinding noise and history of reporting problems would represent either genuine concern before he later acted destructively, or potentially calculated behavior to deflect future suspicion.\n\nThe plastic fragments under his desk would be more directly incriminating evidence of his destructive actions.\n\nHowever, the timing remains the biggest challenge - it's unusual but not impossible that damage Alex caused would manifest as a critical error exactly 7 minutes after he left. Electronic systems can have delayed failures after sustaining damage.\n\nWhile this combination of evidence could theoretically occur if Alex broke the printer, the timing discrepancy and his responsible reporting pattern make it considerably less likely.\n\n25"
