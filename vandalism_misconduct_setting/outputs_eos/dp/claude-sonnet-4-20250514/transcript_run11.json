    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The timing evidence (Alex badging out 7 minutes before the error) would be quite likely - innocent people leave work at normal times, and mechanical failures often occur after stress accumulates from earlier use.\n\n2. Jamie's forceful handling being caught on camera would be very likely - if someone else caused the damage, we'd expect to see evidence of that alternative cause.\n\n3. The documented history of this printer model failing in the same way in other departments would be very likely - this directly supports a mechanical defect explanation rather than user-caused damage.\n\n4. Alex's proactive email about the grinding noise and history of responsible reporting would be very likely - this shows Alex was actually trying to prevent equipment failure and has a pattern of responsible behavior.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are not only consistent with Alex's innocence, but actually quite expected if Alex didn't break the printer. The evidence points toward either a known mechanical defect or Jamie's forceful handling as alternative explanations, while showing Alex was responsibly trying to prevent problems and wasn't even present when the failure occurred.\n\n85"

The timing evidence (badging out 7 minutes before the logged error) would be somewhat likely - Alex could have damaged it and left, with the system taking time to register the critical error, or the damage could have caused a delayed failure.\n\n2. Jamie's earlier forceful handling being on camera would be moderately likely - this could provide convenient cover for Alex's actions, and Jamie's rough handling might have weakened the printer, making Alex's subsequent actions more damaging.\n\n3. The documented history of similar failures in other departments would be quite likely - this gives Alex plausible deniability and makes it easier to hide intentional damage among known defects.\n\n4. Alex's proactive email about grinding noise and responsible reporting history would be less likely but possible - this could be genuine concern that turned into frustration leading to damage, or potentially calculated preparation to appear innocent.\n\nWhile some of these pieces of evidence could still occur if Alex were guilty (especially the timing and the mechanical history providing cover), the combination of all four - particularly the proactive warning email and consistent responsible behavior - would be notably less probable if Alex had actually broken the printer intentionally or recklessly.\n\n25"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again.
