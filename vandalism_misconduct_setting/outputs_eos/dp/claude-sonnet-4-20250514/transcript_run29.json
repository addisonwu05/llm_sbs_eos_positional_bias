    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex badging out 7 minutes before the critical error is actually exonerating evidence - it would be expected that an innocent person wouldn't be present when the failure occurred.\n\n2. Security footage showing Jamie forcefully pulling on jammed paper earlier fits well with Alex's innocence, as it provides an alternative explanation for the damage.\n\n3. The printer model having documented fuser unit issues and similar failures in other departments without improper handling strongly supports a mechanical defect explanation, which is very consistent with Alex's innocence.\n\n4. Alex's prior email about grinding noises and pattern of responsibly reporting equipment problems indicates proactive, responsible behavior rather than destructive conduct.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence align well with Alex being innocent. The timing evidence actually helps Alex's case, the mechanical defect history provides a strong alternative explanation, Jamie's forceful handling offers another potential cause, and Alex's responsible reporting pattern suggests someone who cares about equipment rather than damages it.\n\nThis combination of evidence would be quite expected if Alex is innocent.\n\n85"

For an innocent person, this inconsistency is awkward but possible.\n\nThe combination creates multiple unfortunate coincidences that would need to align: being the last person seen there, expressing frustration just before failure, having matching debris, and giving inconsistent statements.
