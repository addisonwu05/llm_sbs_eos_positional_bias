  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Alex most likely broke the printer. The physical evidence (plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's trash), the contradictory statements about printer usage, the documented frustration with the printer, and being seen near the printer shortly before it broke all point toward Alex's involvement.
