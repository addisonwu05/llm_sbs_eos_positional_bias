  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Alex likely broke the printer. The physical evidence (plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's trash), behavioral evidence (frustration expressed in chat, being the last person seen at the printer), and inconsistent statements about printer use that day collectively point toward Alex's responsibility. While there are some timeline inconsistencies and the printer does have a history of mechanical issues, the preponderance of evidence suggests Alex damaged the printer in a moment of frustration.\n\nYes"
