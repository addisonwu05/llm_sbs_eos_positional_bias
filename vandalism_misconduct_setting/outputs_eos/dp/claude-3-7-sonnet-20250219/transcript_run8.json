    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex badging out 7 minutes before the printer failed is entirely consistent with innocence - in fact, it strongly suggests Alex couldn't have been responsible for the final breakdown.\n\n2. Security footage showing Jamie roughly handling the printer earlier provides an alternative explanation for the damage.\n\n3. Alex's email warning about the printer making grinding noises days before shows they were concerned about its condition, not trying to damage it. This is consistent with someone who cares about proper equipment functioning.\n\n4. The printer model having documented issues with similar failures in other departments suggests a manufacturing defect could be the real cause.\n\n5. Alex's history of promptly reporting equipment problems fits with someone who takes care of office resources.\n\nAll the evidence is highly consistent with Alex's innocence. If Alex didn't break the printer, these exact circumstances would be very likely to occur.\n\n90"

Being seen near the printer minutes before it stopped working - This is problematic for innocence, as it contradicts the timeline where Alex supposedly badged out 7 minutes before the failure.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in team chat - While using frustrated language, this is relatively common office banter about malfunctioning equipment.

Plastic fragments in Alex's trash that resemble the broken tray - This is difficult to explain if Alex is innocent, though without confirmation of an exact match, they could be from another source.\n\n4. Changing the story about printer usage - This inconsistency raises concerns about honesty, though could be explained by simply forgetting a routine task done earlier in the day.\n\nThese new details significantly reduce the likelihood of innocence, particularly the contradicting timeline (being seen at the printer vs. badging out) and the plastic fragments.\n\n25"
