    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex left the building 7 minutes before the printer broke - this timing strongly suggests Alex couldn't have caused the failure that happened after their departure.\n\n2. Jamie was caught on camera roughly handling the printer and was the last visible person using it before the failure - this provides an alternative explanation for the damage.\n\n3. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments - suggesting a potential mechanical defect.\n\n4. Alex proactively reported printer issues days earlier - showing responsible behavior regarding equipment maintenance.\n\n5. Alex has a track record of promptly reporting problems with office equipment - consistent with someone who takes care of shared resources.\n\nAll these points are highly consistent with Alex not being responsible. The timing of Alex's departure before the failure is particularly convincing, as is the documented history of similar failures with this printer model.\n\n95"

This is the most incriminating evidence.\n- Alex's inconsistent statements about using the printer suggest either dishonesty or confusion, but could potentially be explained by forgetfulness rather than guilt.\n\nThe building access logs showing Alex left 7 minutes before the error and security footage showing Jamie's rough handling still support Alex's innocence. However, the new evidence (especially the plastic fragments and being seen at the printer minutes before failure) significantly undermine the innocence scenario.\n\nThe combination of being the last person at the printer, plastic fragments matching the broken part in their trash, the threatening comment, and changing their story about printer usage makes innocence much less likely.\n\n15"
