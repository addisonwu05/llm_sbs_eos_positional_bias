  "Based on the evidence presented, I would conclude: Yes\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests Alex broke the printer:\n- Alex was seen at the printer shortly before it failed\n- Plastic fragments matching the broken printer part were found in Alex's trash\n- Alex expressed frustration about the printer in the team chat (\"going to lose it\")\n- Alex's inconsistent statements about using the printer suggest dishonesty\n- The timing aligns with Alex being near the printer right before the breakdown\n\nWhile there are alternative explanations (Jamie's rough handling, the model's history of failures), the physical evidence of matching fragments in Alex's trash and the inconsistent statements about printer use point more conclusively toward Alex's responsibility."
