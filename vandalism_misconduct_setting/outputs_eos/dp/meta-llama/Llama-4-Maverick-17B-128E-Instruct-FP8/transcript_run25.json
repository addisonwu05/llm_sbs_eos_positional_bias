    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This timing suggests that Alex was not physically present when the error happened, reducing the likelihood that Alex's actions directly caused the failure.\n\n2. **Security Camera Footage**: The footage shows Jamie pulling forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper earlier that afternoon. While it doesn't show the exact moment of the failure, it indicates that Jamie interacted with the printer in a way that could potentially cause damage.\n\n3. **Printer Model's History**: The documented issue with the fuser unit and similar failures in other departments suggest that the failure could be due to a mechanical defect rather than user error.\n\n4. **Alex's Previous Behavior**: Alex had reported the printer making a grinding noise and suggested it might need a check-up. This behavior is consistent with Alex being proactive about maintenance and not indicative of someone who would intentionally cause damage.\n\nConsidering these points:\n- The timing of Alex's departure and the error suggests Alex was not directly responsible.\n- Jamie's interaction with the printer was potentially damaging.\n- The printer model's history indicates a possible mechanical cause.\n- Alex's history of reporting equipment issues suggests a responsible attitude towards office equipment.\n\nGiven these factors, if Alex did not break the printer, it is plausible that the sequence of events and evidence align with the information provided.\n\n80"

However, being near the printer doesn't necessarily mean Alex caused the failure.\n\n2. **Alex's Statement in Team Chat**: Alex's comment about losing it if the printer jammed again could be interpreted as a threat or frustration, but it's also a common idiomatic expression indicating exasperation rather than a literal intent to cause damage.\n\n3. **Initial Denial and Later Admission of Using the Printer**: Alex's initial denial followed by a correction could suggest an attempt to avoid being associated with the printer's failure. However, it could also be a genuine memory lapse or a simple mistake.\n\n4. **Plastic Fragments in Alex's Trash**: The presence of fragments similar to the broken edge of the printer's paper tray under Alex's desk is a strong circumstantial evidence suggesting Alex might have been involved in the damage. However, it doesn't conclusively prove Alex broke the printer, as the fragments could have been there for other reasons.\n\nConsidering these new points:\n- The eyewitness account places Alex near the printer right before it failed.\n- Alex's chat comment indicates frustration with the printer.\n- Alex's denial and later admission could imply an attempt to distance themselves from the incident.\n- The plastic fragments under Alex's desk are a significant circumstantial evidence.\n\nHowever, none of these directly prove Alex broke the printer.
