    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

    "content": "To determine the likelihood of the given observations occurring if Alex did not break the printer, we need to evaluate the probability of each piece of evidence under the assumption of Alex's innocence. We then combine these probabilities.\n\nLet's analyze each observation, assuming Alex did not break the printer (meaning the break was due to ordinary use, Jamie's actions, or a mechanical defect):\n\n1.  **A coworker saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.**\n    *   **If Alex is innocent:** Alex badged out *before* the critical error was logged. This means he was not present for the final moment of failure. The coworker's observation of Alex being near the printer \"five minutes before it stopped working\" could refer to a time before the ultimate critical error, or the coworker's timing/observation might be imprecise. Alex could have been simply walking by, checking a print, or attempting to fix a jam without causing damage, and then left. If someone else (Jamie, or a defect) caused the final breakdown after Alex left, the \"no one else approached\" observation would refer to the period while Alex was there, not necessarily the time leading up to the critical error after he had departed.\n    *   **Likelihood if Alex is innocent:** This is a strong coincidence but not impossible. Given Alex's badge-out time, it means he wasn't there for the final critical event. Thus, his presence earlier is less damning than if he were there at the very moment of failure. We can assign a moderate probability to this, perhaps **40%**.\n\n2.  **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again.**\n    *   **If Alex is innocent:** The printer had a known history of jamming, and Alex had previously reported equipment problems. Expressing frustration about a faulty printer is highly plausible for any employee, regardless of whether they subsequently broke it.\n    *   **Likelihood if Alex is innocent:** Very high, perhaps **90%**.\n\n3.  **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.**\n    *   **If Alex is innocent:** The technician \"did not confirm an exact match.\" This is a crucial detail. It means the fragments are not definitively from the printer. It's plausible that Alex simply had unrelated plastic fragments in his trash that coincidentally looked similar, or he might have innocently picked up fragments from the floor (perhaps after Jamie's forceful tug) and disposed of them in his bin without knowing their significance.\n    *   **Likelihood if Alex is innocent:** While coincidental, the lack of an exact match makes it more probable that these are unrelated items or innocently disposed of. Let's assign a moderately high probability of **70%**.\n\n4.  **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning.**\n    *   **If Alex is innocent:** People can genuinely forget minor actions, especially under informal pressure or at the end of a busy day. An initial denial followed by a correction is a common human reaction, even when innocent, sometimes driven by anxiety or simply recalling a minor detail later.\n    *   **Likelihood if Alex is innocent:** Moderate, perhaps **40%**.\n\nTo find the combined likelihood that *all* these observations occur if Alex did not break the printer, we multiply these probabilities (assuming they are conditionally independent given Alex's innocence, which is a simplifying assumption for this context):\n\nP(All observations | Alex did not break printer) = P(Observation 1) * P(Observation 2) * P(Observation 3) * P(Observation 4)\n= 0.40 * 0.90 * 0.70 * 0.40\n= 0.1008\n\nConverting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer: 0.1008 * 100 = 10.08%.\n\n10"
