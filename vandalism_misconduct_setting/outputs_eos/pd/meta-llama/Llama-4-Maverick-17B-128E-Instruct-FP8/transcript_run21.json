    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given events if Alex did not break the printer, let's analyze each piece of information:\n\n1. **A coworker saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval**: This could be coincidental. Alex might have been near the printer for a legitimate reason. The probability of being seen near the printer by chance isn't extremely low, especially if Alex frequently uses the printer.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again**: This statement, while suggestive, was met with laughing emojis, indicating it was perceived as an expression of frustration rather than a threat. It's not uncommon for people to express frustration with malfunctioning equipment.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk**: The presence of these fragments under Alex's desk could be coincidental. It's possible they were discarded there for an unrelated reason or were mistakenly thrown away by someone else.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning**: This change in statement could indicate uncertainty or a lapse in memory rather than guilt. People often correct themselves as they recall details more accurately.\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, the events described could still occur due to various innocent explanations:\n- Being near the printer before it stopped working could be due to legitimate use or curiosity.\n- Complaining about the printer is a plausible reaction to its history of jamming.\n- The presence of plastic fragments under Alex's desk could be a coincidence or misinterpretation.\n- The initial denial and subsequent correction regarding printer use could reflect genuine uncertainty or a simple mistake in recall.\n\nConsidering these points, while the accumulation of these events might raise suspicions, they do not definitively prove Alex's culpability. The events are not extremely improbable even if Alex is innocent.\n\nGiven the explanations above, the probability that these events occurred if Alex did not break the printer is not extremely low.\n\n20"

This statement could be seen as a precursor to or a reflection of their actions.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk**: If Alex broke the printer, it is plausible they disposed of evidence (the plastic fragments) in their trash, especially if they were trying to conceal their actions.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning**: A person who has damaged the printer might initially deny using it to avoid drawing attention to their actions. Later correcting this denial could be an attempt to appear more honest or to align their statement with facts that might come to light.\n\nIf Alex broke the printer, the combination of these events is quite plausible:\n- Being near the printer is expected if Alex was responsible.\n- Expressing frustration is consistent with a motive for damaging the printer.\n- Disposing of evidence under their own desk could be a careless or panicked move by Alex.\n- The initial denial followed by a correction is a behavior that could be associated with someone trying to hide their involvement.\n\nGiven these considerations, the events described are relatively likely if Alex did break the printer.\n\n80"
