    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To determine the likelihood of the given events occurring if Alex did not break the printer, let's analyze each piece of information provided.\n\n1. **Alex was seen standing next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and no one else approached it in that interval.** If Alex did not break the printer, this observation is still possible if Alex was simply waiting for a print job or checking on the printer's status without causing any damage. The fact that no one else was seen approaching doesn't necessarily imply Alex caused the damage, as the critical failure could have been imminent or already occurred internally without visible signs.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and threatening to \"lose it\" if it jammed again.** This statement, while suggestive of frustration, doesn't directly imply that Alex would damage the printer. Many people express frustration without acting on it. If Alex didn't break the printer, this statement remains as a commentary on their frustration level but doesn't directly relate to the cause of the printer's failure.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex's desk.** If Alex didn't break the printer, the presence of these fragments under their desk could be coincidental. It could also be that someone else disposed of the fragments in Alex's trash, though this implies a level of premeditation to mislead. It's also possible that the fragments came from a different source or were mistakenly identified as coming from the printer tray.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later correcting themselves to say they might have printed something that morning.** Alex's initial denial followed by a correction could indicate a range of behaviors or thought processes. If Alex didn't break the printer, the denial could be due to forgetfulness or a lapse in memory, and the later correction a genuine recollection. However, an innocent person might still be expected to be more consistent in their recollection or to not deny the action outright initially.\n\nConsidering these points, we need to assess the likelihood of these events happening if Alex is innocent (did not break the printer). \n\nThe events as described could occur even if Alex is innocent, though some are less likely under that assumption. The observation of Alex near the printer is possible without implying guilt. The team chat comment reflects frustration but doesn't directly imply action. The presence of plastic fragments under Alex's desk is suspicious but could be coincidental or the result of someone else's actions. The inconsistent statements about using the printer could be due to genuine forgetfulness or nervousness.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the combination of these events is unusual and suspicious if Alex is innocent, it's not impossible.\n\n20"

The fact that no one else was seen approaching supports the notion that Alex could have been responsible.\n\n2. **Alex posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again.** This statement, made earlier in the day, could be seen as a precursor to the action if Alex did indeed break the printer. It indicates a level of frustration that could potentially escalate into destructive behavior.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.** If Alex broke the printer, finding evidence related to the breakage (the plastic fragments) in their trash is likely, as it suggests they might have disposed of the evidence carelessly or didn't think it through.\n\n4. **Alex initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning.** If Alex broke the printer, the initial denial and subsequent correction could indicate an attempt to cover up their actions. The change in story might suggest that Alex was trying to distance themselves from the printer's failure.\n\nAll these events together paint a picture that is quite plausible if Alex did break the printer. The presence near the printer, the prior expression of frustration, the disposal of potentially incriminating evidence, and the attempt to cover up their actions all align with a scenario where Alex is responsible for the printer's failure.\n\n80"

It suggests that if Alex had caused the problem or noticed something wrong, they would likely have reported it, supporting the notion that Alex is not responsible for the breakdown.\n\nAll these points collectively support the scenario where Alex did not break the printer. They show Alex was not present when the printer failed, another person (Jamie) may have mishandled the printer, the printer model is prone to such failures, and Alex has a history of responsible behavior regarding office equipment.\n\n85"
