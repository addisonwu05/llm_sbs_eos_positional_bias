    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these combined events are if Alex did NOT break the printer.\n\nLet's analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1) A coworker saw Alex by the printer shortly before it broke - This could happen regardless of who broke it, especially if Alex was a frequent printer user. But the timing is suspicious.\n\n2) Alex's frustrated message in team chat - This shows Alex was annoyed with the printer, which is consistent with innocent frustration but also establishes motive.\n\n3) Alex's contradictory statements - Initially denying printer use then backtracking suggests potential deception, though could also be honest confusion.\n\n4) Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray - This is the most damning evidence. If Alex didn't break the printer, it's difficult to explain why fragments matching the broken part would be in his trash can.\n\nGiven these facts together, particularly the physical evidence of fragments in Alex's trash, it seems highly unlikely this combination would occur if Alex were innocent. The contradictory statements and timing near the breakdown further reduce this probability.\n\n25"

While not absolutely certain (Alex could have broken it unintentionally, or the fragments could be from something else), the combined evidence forms a coherent pattern that would be highly expected if Alex did break the printer.\n\n90"
