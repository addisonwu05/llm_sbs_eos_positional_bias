  "No. The evidence strongly suggests Alex did not break the printer. The access logs show Alex was physically out of the building seven minutes before the printer failure occurred. There's security footage of Jamie roughly handling the printer, and the printer model has a documented history of similar failures in other departments. Additionally, Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment issues, including emailing about this specific printer making grinding noises days before. While there are some suspicious elements like the plastic fragments and initial confusion about printer use, the timeline evidence and pattern of responsible behavior make it unlikely that Alex was responsible for breaking the printer."
