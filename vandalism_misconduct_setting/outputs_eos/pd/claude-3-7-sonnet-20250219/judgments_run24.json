  "No\n\nBased on the evidence, Alex most likely did not break the printer. The timing is the most compelling exonerating factor - Alex badged out 7 minutes before the printer failed according to its internal log. Additionally, the printer model has a documented history of similar failures, security footage shows Jamie handling the printer roughly, and Alex has a history of properly reporting equipment issues (including warning about this printer). While the plastic fragments and Alex's inconsistent statements raise questions, the technical evidence strongly suggests the printer failed due to either its known defect or Jamie's actions rather than anything Alex did."
