    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Coworker saw Alex near the printer shortly before failure: Access logs show Alex badged out before the error occurred, creating a contradiction with this eyewitness account. This raises questions about the accuracy of the coworker's timing or recollection.\n\n2. \"Lose it\" comment in team chat: This shows frustration but doesn't necessarily indicate intent to damage equipment. Many people use such expressions hyperbolically.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash: This is the most incriminating evidence. However, without confirmation they match the printer exactly, it's possible they're from something else.\n\n4. Inconsistent statements about printer use: This suggests Alex may be being deceptive, though people often forget mundane activities like printing.\n\nMitigating factors include:\n- The printer has a known history of failures (defective fuser unit)\n- Jamie was seen roughly handling the printer earlier\n- Alex was possibly not even present when the error occurred (based on access logs)\n\nIf Alex didn't break the printer, the constellation of these specific events would be quite unlikely. The plastic fragments and inconsistent story are particularly difficult to explain innocently.\n\n15"

Alex badged out 7 minutes before the printer error - This timing makes it physically impossible for Alex to have caused the final breakdown if the timestamps are accurate.\n\n2. Security footage shows Jamie roughly handling the printer - This provides an alternative explanation for the damage, as Jamie's actions could have contributed to the failure.\n\n3. The printer model has a documented history of similar failures - This indicates an inherent vulnerability in the device itself, making a non-human-caused failure more plausible.\n\n4. Alex previously reported concerns about the printer - This shows a pattern of responsible behavior regarding equipment rather than carelessness.\n\nThese factors collectively provide strong alternative explanations for the printer failure that don't involve Alex.
