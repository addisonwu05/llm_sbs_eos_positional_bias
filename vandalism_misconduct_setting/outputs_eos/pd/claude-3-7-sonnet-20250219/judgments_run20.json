  "Based on the evidence presented, I would say No, Alex did not break the printer.\n\nThe timing evidence is particularly compelling - Alex badged out of the building at 5:12 pm, while the printer's error log shows the critical failure occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex had already left the building.\n\nAdditional exculpatory factors include:\n- Security footage showing Jamie forcefully handling the printer just before the failure\n- The printer model's documented history of similar failures in other departments\n- Alex's proactive email about the printer making grinding noises three days earlier\n- Alex's established pattern of properly reporting equipment issues\n\nWhile there are some suspicious elements (the plastic fragments, Alex's contradictory statements, and the complaint about \"losing it\"), the timeline makes it physically impossible for Alex to have caused the final breakdown, and the printer's known defects plus Jamie's rough handling provide a more plausible explanation for the failure."
