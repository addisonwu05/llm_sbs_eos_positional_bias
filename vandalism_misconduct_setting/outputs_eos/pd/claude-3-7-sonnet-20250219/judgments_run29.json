The timing evidence showing Alex badged out 7 minutes before the printer failure is particularly compelling, along with the printer's documented history of similar failures and Jamie's rough handling caught on camera. While the plastic fragments and Alex's inconsistent statements raise suspicion, the timing evidence, Alex's history of reporting equipment issues, and the known defects with this printer model suggest the failure was likely due to other causes rather than Alex's actions."
