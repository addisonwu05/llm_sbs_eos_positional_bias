    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

A coworker seeing Alex near the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This could reasonably happen if Alex was just using the printer normally or checking on a print job. However, the timing is quite coincidental if he's innocent.\n\n2. The threatening message about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This could be innocent workplace venting, but creates a clear motive and shows escalating frustration.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in his personal trash - This is highly suspicious. If Alex didn't break it, how would these fragments end up specifically in his trash can? There are few innocent explanations for this.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use, then changing his story - Memory lapses about routine activities happen, but the specific denial followed by correction looks like potential deception, especially given the other evidence.\n\nWhile each piece of evidence individually might have innocent explanations, their combination creates a very strong pattern pointing toward guilt. The plastic fragments in his personal trash can are particularly difficult to explain innocently, and the false initial denial suggests consciousness of guilt.\n\nThe probability that all four of these things would occur if Alex was truly innocent is very low.\n\n15"

The threatening message about \"losing it\" if it jammed again - This establishes clear motive and shows his escalating frustration had reached a breaking point. Very consistent with someone who then acted on that frustration.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray in his personal trash - If he broke it, he would likely try to dispose of evidence, and small fragments could easily end up in his nearby trash can during cleanup. This is highly expected behavior.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing story - Classic behavior of someone trying to distance themselves from the scene after causing damage, then realizing the denial might be contradicted by evidence, so providing a limited admission while minimizing involvement.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align extremely well with a scenario where Alex broke the printer.

Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.
