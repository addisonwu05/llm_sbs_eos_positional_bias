    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex posting \"If it does this one more time I'm going to lose it\" - This could reasonably happen even if innocent, as it just expresses frustration with a malfunctioning printer.\n\n2. Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This is somewhat unlikely for an innocent person, but possible if Alex was just checking on it or happened to be in the area.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the broken tray found in Alex's trash - This is highly suspicious and would be quite unlikely if Alex were innocent, unless someone deliberately planted evidence.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing the story - This inconsistency suggests either poor memory or attempted deception. While people do sometimes misremember, the specific pattern of denial followed by partial admission is concerning.\n\nThe combination of all four elements creates a pattern that would be quite improbable if Alex were completely innocent. While each individual piece might have an innocent explanation, their convergence significantly reduces the likelihood of innocence.\n\nThe most damaging evidence is the plastic fragments in Alex's trash combined with the inconsistent statements about printer usage. Even accounting for the possibility of coincidence, faulty memory, or other explanations, the overall probability of this exact combination occurring if Alex were innocent is quite low.\n\n15"

Initially denying printer use then changing story - Very likely behavior if Alex broke it and was trying to distance himself from the incident, then realized complete denial wasn't credible so shifted to a minimal admission.\n\nIf Alex actually broke the printer, this combination of evidence represents exactly what we would expect to see: proximity to the scene, prior expressed frustration, attempted cover-up through disposal of evidence, and deceptive statements followed by partial admissions when pressed.\n\nThe only elements that aren't completely certain are whether all plastic fragments would end up specifically in his trash (rather than being disposed of elsewhere) and whether a coworker would happen to witness his presence at the right time.\n\n85"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.

Alex previously emailing about grinding noise and pattern of responsible reporting - This is somewhat unlikely if Alex intended to break the printer, as it shows genuine concern for equipment maintenance. However, it's possible if Alex broke it impulsively rather than deliberately.\n\nThe most problematic element is the timing - if Alex broke the printer, how could the critical error occur 7 minutes after he left the building? This would require either:\n- The damage Alex caused took time to manifest as a complete failure\n- The access logs or printer logs are inaccurate\n- Alex re-entered without badging in\n\nWhile delayed mechanical failure is possible, the combination of Alex being absent when the error occurred, plus his responsible reporting history, makes this evidence pattern quite unlikely if he actually broke the printer.\n\n25"
