    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This could happen innocently if Alex was just using the printer normally or checking on a print job.\n\n2. The team chat message about \"losing it\" if the printer jammed again - This was posted hours earlier at noon and appears to be a common workplace frustration expressed in a public forum with colleagues reacting with laughing emojis, suggesting it was taken as venting rather than a serious threat.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash can similar to the broken tray - This is perhaps the most suspicious element, though fragments could potentially end up there through innocent means (cleaning up after a jam, disposing of broken pieces found elsewhere, etc.).\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then correcting to \"might have printed something in the morning\" - This inconsistency in memory about morning use doesn't directly relate to the afternoon failure time, and people often have imperfect recall about routine activities.\n\nWhile some of these elements raise suspicion when viewed together, each individual piece of evidence has plausible innocent explanations. The combination creates a pattern that seems moderately unlikely but not implausible for an innocent person, especially considering the printer had known mechanical issues and Alex had a history of reporting equipment problems legitimately.\n\n25"

Initially denying printer use then correcting to morning use only - If Alex broke the printer, they would likely want to distance themselves from recent interaction with it. The initial denial followed by partial admission suggests deceptive behavior consistent with guilt.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence align well with a scenario where Alex broke the printer. The temporal proximity, the prior expressed frustration, the physical evidence in his possession, and the inconsistent statements all fit together coherently if Alex is guilty.
