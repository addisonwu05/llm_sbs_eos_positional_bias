    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Alex being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - This could happen innocently if Alex was just using it normally or checking on it.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" message in chat - This seems like typical workplace frustration venting and doesn't necessarily indicate intent to damage equipment.\n\n3. Plastic fragments matching the tray in Alex's trash - This is the most problematic piece of evidence for innocence. If Alex didn't break it, how did matching fragments end up in their personal trash? Possible explanations include: fragments from an earlier minor incident, someone else disposing evidence in Alex's bin, or the fragments being from something else entirely (since an exact match wasn't confirmed).\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing the story - This could indicate deception, but could also be honest confusion about daily activities, especially if the initial question caught Alex off-guard.\n\nWhile each piece of evidence individually could have innocent explanations, the combination - especially the plastic fragments in Alex's trash and the inconsistent statements - makes it quite unlikely that all of this would occur if Alex were completely uninvolved in the printer's damage.\n\nThe convergence of circumstantial evidence, physical evidence, and behavioral indicators significantly reduces the probability of complete innocence.\n\n25"

Coworker seeing Alex next to the printer 5 minutes before failure with no one else approaching - If Alex broke it, this would be very likely as he would need to be there at the time of the incident.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" chat message about printer jamming - This establishes frustration and could indicate escalating anger that led to damaging the printer. Very consistent with someone who later acted on that frustration.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray - If Alex broke the tray, he might try to dispose of evidence. This would be quite likely as people often try to hide evidence of damage they caused.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then changing story - Classic behavior of someone caught off-guard who initially lies to avoid responsibility, then partially backtracks when they realize the denial might be easily disproven. This pattern is very common when people are guilty but trying to minimize their involvement.\n\nIf Alex actually did break the printer, all of these pieces of evidence align very well with expected behavior patterns: being present at the scene, having expressed prior frustration, attempting to dispose of physical evidence, and showing deceptive behavior when questioned.\n\nThe evidence forms a coherent narrative that would be highly likely if Alex were indeed responsible for the damage.\n\n85"

According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nThree days before the breakdown, Alex emailed facilities to say the printer had been making a grinding noise and “might need a check-up before it breaks for real.” In previous incidents involving broken office equipment, Alex has been the one to report problems promptly and cooperate with maintenance.\n\n\nThe building technician notes that this particular printer model has a documented issue with its fuser unit. The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer.

If Alex didn't break it, him being gone when it actually failed makes perfect sense.\n\n2.

Jamie's forceful actions could easily have caused delayed failure.\n\n3. Documented history of this printer model failing similarly in other departments - If Alex is innocent, a mechanical defect would be a natural explanation. The pattern of similar failures without improper handling strongly supports this.\n\n4. Alex's proactive email about grinding noise and history of reporting problems - This behavior is completely consistent with someone who responsibly reports issues rather than causes them. It shows Alex was trying to prevent problems, not create them.\n\nIf Alex is innocent, all of this evidence fits together extremely well. The timing alibi, alternative suspect with documented rough handling, known mechanical defects in this model, and Alex's responsible track record create a very coherent innocent explanation.

People can change behavior, but this contradicts his track record.\n\nThe biggest issue is the timing - the access log showing Alex left 7 minutes before the logged error creates a serious obstacle to the theory that Alex directly broke it.
