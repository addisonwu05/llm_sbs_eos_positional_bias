    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure: This could happen innocently - Alex might have been checking on a print job, walking by, or investigating an issue without causing damage.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in chat: This appears to be workplace venting about a frustrating printer, with coworkers responding with laughing emojis suggesting it was taken as normal complaint behavior rather than a serious threat.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash: This is harder to explain innocently. If Alex didn't break the printer, how did fragments matching the broken tray end up in their personal trash? Possible innocent explanations include: fragments from an earlier minor incident, coincidental similar plastic, or someone else disposing of evidence in Alex's trash, but these seem less likely.\n\n4. Initial denial then correction about printer use: Memory lapses about routine activities like printing are common, especially when questioned unexpectedly about events from earlier in the day.\n\nThe first, second, and fourth pieces of evidence have plausible innocent explanations. However, the plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash can are difficult to explain if Alex didn't cause the damage. This creates a significant constraint on the probability.\n\nEven assuming Alex is innocent, the combination of being the last person seen near the printer AND having matching debris in their personal trash creates a very unlikely coincidence.\n\n15"

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure: If Alex broke it, being seen nearby right before the failure would be very likely - this fits the timeline perfectly.\n\n2. The \"lose it\" comment in chat: This would be highly likely if Alex later acted on their frustration. The earlier complaint establishes motive and emotional state that led to the destructive action.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash: If Alex broke the printer, disposing of evidence would be a natural attempt to avoid detection. Finding matching fragments in their personal trash would be very likely.\n\n4. Initial denial then correction: If Alex broke the printer, initially denying any interaction would be expected behavior to avoid suspicion. The later \"correction\" to admitting possible morning use could be an attempt to provide cover in case other evidence emerged, while still avoiding admitting to being there during the actual incident.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align very well with Alex being guilty. The witness sighting provides opportunity, the chat message provides motive, the plastic fragments provide physical evidence, and the changing story suggests consciousness of guilt and an attempt to mislead.\n\nEach piece of evidence would be quite likely if Alex were guilty, and together they form a coherent narrative.\n\n85"
