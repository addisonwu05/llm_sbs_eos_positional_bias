    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nAround noon, Alex posted in the team chat: “This printer jammed on me again. If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure: If Alex didn't break it, this could be coincidental - perhaps checking on a print job or noticing it was malfunctioning. This is somewhat likely even if innocent.\n\n2. The team chat complaint about \"losing it\": This appears to be a frustrated expression that many employees might make about malfunctioning equipment. The laughing emoji reactions suggest coworkers interpreted it as venting rather than a serious threat. This is quite likely even if innocent.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray: This is the most problematic evidence for innocence. If Alex didn't break the printer, how would matching fragments end up in their personal trash? Possible innocent explanations are very limited - perhaps fragments fell on them and they brushed them off later, but this seems unlikely.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then correcting to possible morning use: Memory lapses about routine activities are common, and the correction shows honesty rather than deception. This is reasonably likely even if innocent.\n\nThe combination of all four factors, particularly the plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash can, makes innocence significantly less probable. While individual pieces might be explained away, their convergence creates a compelling pattern that would be quite unlikely if Alex was completely uninvolved in the printer's breakdown.\n\n25"

Being seen next to the printer 5 minutes before failure: If Alex broke it, being observed near the printer right before it failed would be very likely - this would be when the damaging incident occurred.\n\n2. The team chat complaint about \"losing it\": This establishes a clear motive and frustrated state of mind that would make breaking the printer more probable. Such expressions of frustration are very common before someone acts impulsively.\n\n3. Plastic fragments in Alex's trash matching the broken tray: If Alex broke the printer and pieces scattered or stuck to them, disposing of the evidence in their own trash would be likely. People often hastily dispose of incriminating evidence nearby.\n\n4. Initially denying printer use then correcting to morning use: If Alex broke it, they would likely want to distance themselves from any printer interaction that day. The initial denial followed by a partial admission (claiming only morning use) is very consistent with someone trying to minimize their connection while avoiding an outright lie when they realize others might have seen them.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence align very well with Alex being responsible. The combination creates a coherent narrative: frustrated employee makes threat, is seen at the scene when damage occurs, has physical evidence, and shows deceptive behavior when questioned.\n\n85"

The combination creates a clear alternative narrative: a defective printer model that Alex had already flagged for problems, subjected to rough handling by another employee, finally failing on its own after Alex had left the building.
