    "content": "In a small open-plan office, the only shared printer suddenly stops working late in the afternoon. When someone tries to print, the machine displays a critical hardware error and will not restart. The side panel is slightly ajar, and the paper tray is cracked.\nAlex, a mid-level employee who frequently uses this printer, becomes the focus of informal suspicion. Earlier in the day, Alex had complained about the printer repeatedly jamming, and at least one coworker remembers seeing Alex near the printer not long before it stopped working. Later, small plastic fragments are found in the trash can under Alex’s desk.\nHowever, the situation is complicated by other information that does not clearly resolve who is responsible. Building access logs show that Alex badged out of the office shortly before the time of the critical error recorded in the printer log, but they do not indicate what condition the printer was in when Alex last used or approached it. There is also security footage of another coworker, Jamie, tugging forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, without showing what happened in the final minutes before the failure. The building technician notes that this printer model has a known history of failing due to a defective fuser unit, and Alex has previously reported problems with office equipment, but these background facts do not by themselves determine whether the breakdown here resulted from ordinary use, rough handling by one of the employees, or an underlying mechanical defect.\nAlex is effectively being evaluated for whether their actions caused the printer to break (for example, through reckless or intentional handling), as opposed to the breakdown being due to ordinary use, someone else’s actions, or an underlying mechanical defect.\n\n\n"

If it does this one more time I’m going to lose it.” Several coworkers reacted with laughing emojis.\n\n\nWhen facilities staff inspected the area after the failure, they found small plastic fragments in the trash can under Alex’s desk. The technician notes that the fragments appear similar in color and texture to the broken edge of the printer’s paper tray, though they did not confirm an exact match.\n\n\nA coworker reports that they saw Alex standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, and they did not notice anyone else approach it in that interval.\n\n\nWhen first asked informally about the printer, Alex said, “Oh, I didn’t use the printer today.” In a later conversation, Alex corrected themselves: “Actually, I might have printed something quickly this morning, but I’m not totally sure.”\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that: a coworker saw him standing right next to the printer about five minutes before it stopped working, with no one else approaching in that interval, he posted in the team chat complaining about the printer and saying they were going to “lose it” if it jammed again, plastic fragments similar in appearance to the broken tray were found in the trash can under his desk, and he initially denied using the printer that day before later saying they might have printed something that morning?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This has moderate probability even if innocent.\n\n2. **The threatening chat message**: People often express frustration with malfunctioning equipment without actually intending to damage it. The laughing emoji reactions suggest coworkers didn't take it as a serious threat. This could reasonably occur even if Alex didn't break it.\n\n3. **Plastic fragments in Alex's trash**: This is the most incriminating evidence. If Alex didn't break the printer, how would fragments matching the broken tray end up in their personal trash? Possible innocent explanations include: fragments from an earlier incident, fragments that fell and Alex cleaned them up, or fragments from a different source that happen to look similar. However, these explanations are less probable.\n\n4. **Initial denial then correction about using the printer**: Memory lapses about routine activities are common, especially when asked unexpectedly. The correction from \"didn't use it\" to \"might have printed something in the morning\" shows Alex is trying to be accurate rather than maintaining a false story.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence could have innocent explanations, the combination - especially the plastic fragments in Alex's personal trash can - creates a pattern that would be quite unlikely if Alex were completely innocent.\n\nThe probability that all four pieces of evidence would align this way by coincidence, while possible, is relatively low.\n\n25"

People often dispose of evidence hastily and imperfectly when trying to hide wrongdoing.\n\n4. **Initial denial then partial correction**: If Alex broke the printer, initially denying any interaction would be a natural defensive response to avoid suspicion. The later \"correction\" to admitting possible morning use (while still not admitting to the afternoon incident) fits a pattern of trying to explain away evidence while maintaining plausible deniability.\n\nIf Alex actually did break the printer, all four pieces of evidence would fit together very coherently. The threatening message provides motive, being seen at the printer provides opportunity, the plastic fragments provide physical evidence, and the initial denial followed by partial admission shows consciousness of guilt and an attempt to minimize involvement.\n\nThis combination of evidence would be quite expected if Alex were actually guilty.\n\n85"

The same model has failed in a similar way in two other departments in the last six months, in both cases without any evidence of improper handling.\n\n\nBuilding access logs show that Alex badged out of the office at 5:12 pm. According to the printer’s internal error log, the critical hardware error occurred at 5:19 pm, seven minutes after Alex left the building.\n\n\nSecurity camera footage from earlier that afternoon shows another coworker, Jamie, pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer. Jamie is the last clearly visible person using the printer on the footage prior to the failure.\n\n\nIf Alex did not break the printer, how likely is it that he badged out of the building seven minutes before the critical error recorded in the printer’s log, security camera footage shows Jamie pulling repeatedly and somewhat forcefully on a jammed sheet of paper in the printer earlier that afternoon, the printer model has a documented history of failing in the same way in other departments, and he had previously emailed facilities about a grinding noise and has a pattern of promptly reporting equipment problems?\n\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This evidence strongly supports innocence.\n\n2. **Security footage showing Jamie forcefully pulling on jammed paper**: If Alex didn't break it, it's quite likely that someone else's rough handling (like Jamie's) could have caused or contributed to the failure. This provides an alternative explanation and is very consistent with Alex's innocence.\n\n3. **Documented history of this printer model failing similarly**: If Alex didn't break it, the printer failing due to a known mechanical defect would be entirely expected. This model has already failed twice in the same way without improper handling, making a third natural failure quite probable.\n\n4. **Alex's proactive email about grinding noise and history of reporting problems**: If Alex is innocent, this behavior pattern is exactly what we'd expect - someone who responsibly reports equipment issues and tries to prevent problems. The proactive warning about potential failure shows concern for preventing damage, not causing it.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are highly consistent with Alex being innocent. They create a coherent alternative narrative: Alex noticed problems and reported them responsibly, Jamie's forceful handling may have contributed to the failure, the printer failed due to known defects after Alex had already left, and the timing exonerates Alex completely.\n\n95"

This is possible but reduces the likelihood that Alex's actions were the cause.\n\n4. **Alex's proactive email and history of reporting problems**: If Alex broke the printer, having previously warned about problems and having a track record of responsible reporting would be contradictory behavior. Someone planning to break equipment typically wouldn't create a paper trail showing their concern for preventing damage.\n\nThe combination of these four pieces of evidence would be quite unlikely if Alex actually broke the printer. The timing evidence especially creates a nearly impossible scenario - Alex would have had to break the printer and leave, with the system only registering the failure 7 minutes later.
