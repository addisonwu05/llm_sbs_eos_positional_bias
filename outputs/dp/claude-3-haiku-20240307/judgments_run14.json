  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the finding of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is relatively likely, as these can be common findings in natural deaths or as a result of resuscitation attempts. The background information provided indicates that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a possible explanation for the deaths of Andy and Ben, and the frequency of SIDS in the UK is 1 in 4,000, which is relatively high.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively low. The background information suggests that these findings are more commonly associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n20",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the injuries found in Andy are likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts, as the background information suggests that such injuries are commonly associated with efforts to revive a person, especially a baby.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the injuries found in Andy are less likely to be consistent with resuscitation attempts and more likely to be the result of intentional harm. The background information suggests that the injuries, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, are not typical of those resulting from resuscitation efforts alone.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are likely if Jane is GUILTY is:\n\n70",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the absence of typical smothering-related injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively likely. The background information suggests that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are more commonly associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the absence of typical smothering-related injuries such as petechiae in Ben is less likely. The background information suggests that petechiae are a common finding in deaths due to smothering, and their absence would be unexpected if Jane had intentionally smothered Ben.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is GUILTY is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The background information suggests that the injuries, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, are commonly associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and may not have been immediately visible or noticeable to the nurses.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. If Jane had intentionally caused the injuries, it would be expected that they would have been visible and noticeable to the nurses upon admission.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is GUILTY, is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is relatively low. The background information suggests that these findings can also be associated with natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely to be consistent with smothering or other violent trauma. The background information suggests that these specific findings are strongly associated with intentional harm and not natural causes.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is GUILTY is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low. The background information suggests that these injuries can also be associated with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, and do not necessarily imply intentional harm.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n30",

  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. The background information suggests that the hypoxic damage could be associated with natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which may not have a clear timeline of events.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is high. The background information suggests that the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused shortly before death is consistent with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is GUILTY is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the similarities between the two incidents, such as the babies being of similar age, dying at similar times of day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are relatively likely. These similarities could be due to coincidence or natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is known to affect infants of similar ages and have a higher incidence at certain times of day.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents are likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the similarities between the two incidents, such as the babies being of similar age, dying at similar times of day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are highly likely. These similarities suggest a pattern of behavior that is consistent with intentional harm, rather than just coincidence or natural causes.\n\nGiven this information, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents are likely if Jane is GUILTY is:\n\n90",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the two counts of murder of her children, Andy and Ben, is:\n\n80",
  "Based on the overall assessment of the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
