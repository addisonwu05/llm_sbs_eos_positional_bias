  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are highly likely to be consistent with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or the result of resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm.\n\nThe case details suggest that the injuries found in Andy's autopsy, such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, could be explained by natural causes or as a result of the resuscitation efforts. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls, which aligns with the case details.\n\nGiven the lack of clear evidence of intentional harm and the plausibility of natural causes or resuscitation-related injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are highly likely to be the result of intentional harm, such as smothering.\n\nThe case details suggest that the injuries found in Andy's autopsy, including bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are more consistent with intentional harm rather than natural causes or resuscitation efforts. The subsequent finding of similar injuries in the second child, Ben, further supports the likelihood of Jane being responsible for the deaths of both children.\n\nGiven the pattern of injuries and the fact that both children died under suspicious circumstances, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in Ben is highly likely.\n\nThe case details indicate that while Ben had injuries to the ribs, spinal cord, and evidence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, the absence of other typical smothering injuries such as petechiae suggests that the cause of death may not have been intentional smothering.\n\nGiven the plausibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a potential explanation, and the lack of clear evidence of intentional harm, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in Ben is less likely.\n\nWhile the case details indicate that Ben had injuries to the ribs, spinal cord, and evidence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, the lack of other typical smothering injuries such as petechiae would be unusual if Jane had intentionally smothered both of her children.\n\nPetechiae are a common indicator of smothering, and their absence, despite the presence of other injuries, suggests that the cause of death may not have been intentional smothering as alleged.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the injuries found and the typical signs of smothering, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is very high.\n\nThe case details indicate that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation efforts. This suggests that these injuries do not necessarily point to intentional harm.\n\nGiven the plausibility of these injuries being the result of natural causes or the resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is lower.\n\nWhile the case details indicate that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, the presence of these injuries along with the other evidence suggesting intentional harm (such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages) makes it less likely that these injuries were solely the result of natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the context of the case and the potential for these injuries to be part of a pattern of intentional harm, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural causes or resuscitation is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe case details indicate that the injuries to Ben's ribs, spinal cord, and evidence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages were not noted by the nurses when he was brought in. This suggests that these injuries may have occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital, rather than being present beforehand.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence that these injuries were present when Ben arrived at the hospital, and the possibility of natural causes or resuscitation-related injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nThe case details indicate that the injuries to Ben's ribs, spinal cord, and evidence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages were not noted by the nurses when he was brought in. However, if Jane is guilty of intentionally harming Ben, it is more probable that these injuries were present at the time he was brought to the hospital, and simply went unnoticed by the medical staff.\n\nGiven the potential for Jane to have intentionally caused the injuries, and the lack of clear documentation that the injuries were not present initially, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is lower.\n\nThe case details indicate that these specific injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma. However, if Jane is not guilty, then these injuries are less likely to be the result of intentional harm and more likely to be due to other factors, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or complications from a medical condition.\n\nGiven the potential for natural causes or unintentional factors to explain these injuries, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high.\n\nThe case details indicate that these specific injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma. If Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her children, then these injuries are more likely to be the result of her actions, such as smothering Ben.\n\nGiven the strong link between these types of injuries and intentional harm, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is high.\n\nThe case details indicate that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death. If Jane is not guilty, then this timeline would be more likely, as the hypoxic damage could have resulted from natural causes or an unintentional incident, rather than being the result of intentional harm.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence of intentional harm if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n80%",

However, if Jane is guilty of intentionally harming Ben, it is more likely that the timeline of the hypoxic damage would not fit the narrative of a natural or accidental incident.\n\nGiven the potential for Jane to have intentionally caused the hypoxic damage, if she is guilty, the likelihood that it was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is lower.\n\nThe case details indicate that these injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death are characteristic of abuse and smothering. However, if Jane is not guilty, then it is more likely that these injuries were either due to natural causes, resuscitation attempts, or some other unintentional incident, rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the potential for alternative explanations if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is:\n\n30%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is high.\n\nThe case details outline several key similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, such as their ages, the time of day, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. \n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then these similarities could be explained by natural causes or unintentional factors, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which can affect infants of similar ages and often occurs after feedings. The timing and circumstances of the incidents may also simply be coincidental.\n\nGiven the potential for these similarities to have natural or accidental explanations if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is:\n\n80%",
