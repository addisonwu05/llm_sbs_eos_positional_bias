  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The nurses failed to detect these injuries, which suggests they were not visible at that time. Given the rarity of SIDS and the fact that Andy's death was attributed to natural causes, it is plausible that both deaths were due to SIDS, a sudden and unexplainable phenomenon. Therefore, the probability that the injuries on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. As the perpetrator, Jane would have likely inflicted the injuries, which were then overlooked or missed by the nurses. Given the nature of the injuries, it is improbable that they would have gone completely unnoticed. Therefore, the probability that the injuries on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben. The autopsy findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are common in natural infant deaths, such as SIDS, or can occur due to resuscitation attempts. Given that the initial cause of death for Ben was unknown, and SIDS is a common explanation for unexplained infant deaths, the presence of these findings does not necessarily indicate foul play. Therefore, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is moderately likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben. While these findings can occur in natural infant deaths or during resuscitation attempts, the presence of other suspicious injuries suggests the possibility of foul play. If Jane did intentionally harm Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could have been a result of the abuse or the attempts to cover it up. Therefore, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n60",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with the resuscitation attempts. The initial assessment attributed the injuries, such as the bruises and torn frenulum, to the efforts to revive the baby. Given the fragility of infants, these types of injuries are commonly seen during resuscitation, especially in cases of sudden and unexplained infant deaths like SIDS. Therefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to the resuscitation attempts is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is moderately likely that the injuries found in Andy were due to resuscitation attempts. While the initial assessment attributed the injuries to the attempts to revive the baby, the subsequent discovery of suspicious injuries in the second child, Ben, raises doubts about the cause of Andy's injuries. If Jane had intentionally harmed Andy, the injuries could have been inflicted prior to the resuscitation attempts, making them appear consistent with the reviving efforts. Therefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were due to the resuscitation attempts is:\n\n60",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is consistent with a natural death, such as SIDS. Petechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering or suffocation, but their absence does not necessarily rule out other causes of death, especially in the case of sudden infant death syndrome. Given the rarity of SIDS and the lack of clear evidence of foul play, the absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben is likely. Therefore, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is unlikely. Petechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering or suffocation, which is the alleged method of murder. The fact that these typical signs of suffocation were not present raises questions about the cause of Ben's death, especially if Jane is the perpetrator. The lack of these expected injuries would be unusual if Jane had indeed smothered Ben. Therefore, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is moderate. While these findings can be consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, they can also occur in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. Without clear evidence of intentional harm, the presence of these injuries does not definitively indicate that Jane is guilty. Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely. These injuries are commonly associated with smothering or other violent trauma, which are the alleged methods of murder. The presence of these specific findings, along with the other suspicious injuries, strongly suggests that Jane intentionally caused Ben's death. Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between both incidents are highly likely. The coincidences in the timing, circumstances, and manner of the deaths of both babies are consistent with a natural cause of death, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a leading cause of death in young infants, and the similarities between the two cases could be explained by the unpredictable and unexplainable nature of this syndrome. Therefore, the probability that the similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between both incidents are highly unlikely. The coincidences in the timing, circumstances, and manner of the deaths of both babies are highly suspicious and raise concerns about the possibility of intentional harm. If Jane is the perpetrator, the similarities between the two cases would be unlikely to occur naturally and would more likely be the result of a calculated and premeditated plan to commit the murders. Therefore, the probability that the similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n10",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is low. These injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, which would be inconsistent with a natural death such as SIDS. If Jane is not the perpetrator, the presence of these suspicious injuries raises doubts about the initial assessment of Andy's death and the possibility of an undetected underlying cause. Therefore, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are likely if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are highly likely. These injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, which would be consistent with the alleged method of murder. If Jane is the perpetrator, the presence of these suspicious injuries in the first child, Andy, would further support the case against her and the likelihood that she intentionally harmed both children. Therefore, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are likely if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is moderately likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. While the doctor's assessment suggests a recent injury, the underlying cause could still be a natural event, such as a sudden and unpredictable medical complication. Without clear evidence of intentional harm, the timeline of the brain damage is not conclusive in determining guilt. Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n60",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The doctor's assessment that the brain damage was a recent injury is consistent with the alleged method of murder, which would involve intentional suffocation or smothering. If Jane is the perpetrator, the timeline of the brain damage supports the claim that she caused the harm shortly before Ben's death. Therefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n90",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70",
  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe the defendant, Jane, is Guilty."
