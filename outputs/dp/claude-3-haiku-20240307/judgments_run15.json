  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely consistent with the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) explanation. The risk factors for SIDS, such as male gender and the timing of the death, align with the case details. Additionally, the initial assessment of Andy's injuries as being due to resuscitation attempts further supports this explanation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are likely if Jane is not guilty is 75%.\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are highly likely to be the result of intentional smothering or suffocation. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are all consistent with signs of asphyxiation and point to non-accidental injuries.\n\nGiven the evidence, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are likely if Jane is guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The absence of the injuries being noted by the nurses suggests they likely developed later, potentially due to natural causes or accidental factors.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The presence of injuries such as rib fractures, hypoxic brain damage, and hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids are consistent with intentional smothering or suffocation, and it is improbable that these severe injuries were not noticed by the medical staff upon admission.\n\nGiven the evidence, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is guilty is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely. Petechiae are often associated with smothering or suffocation, but their presence can be variable and depend on factors like the duration and method of the asphyxiation. The absence of these typical injuries does not necessarily rule out SIDS or other natural causes of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is not guilty is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is unlikely. Petechiae are a common finding in cases of intentional smothering or suffocation, as they are caused by the disruption of blood vessels due to the asphyxiation. The presence of other severe injuries in Ben, such as rib fractures and hypoxic brain damage, further suggests that the absence of petechiae would be unexpected if the cause of death was indeed intentional.\n\nGiven the evidence, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is likely if Jane is guilty is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, as indicated in the background information. Spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or as a result of resuscitation efforts, which do not necessarily point to intentional harm.\n\nGiven the context provided, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are likely if Jane is not guilty is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is moderate. While the background information suggests these injuries can be consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts, the presence of other severe injuries, such as the hypoxic brain damage, raises the possibility that the spinal bleeding and rib dislocations could also be related to the intentional smothering or suffocation of the child.\n\nGiven the evidence, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are likely if Jane is guilty is 60%.\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between both incidents, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, are likely. These factors can be coincidental and do not necessarily point to intentional harm. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) can occur in similar circumstances, and the timing and circumstances of the deaths could be reasonably explained by natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is not guilty is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between both incidents, such as the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them, are highly likely. The striking parallels between the two deaths, especially when considered alongside the other evidence of potential foul play, suggest a pattern of intentional harm rather than a coincidence. The similarities in the circumstances raise the probability that the deaths were not due to natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these similarities between both incidents are likely if Jane is guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These types of injuries are more commonly associated with intentional smothering or other violent trauma, as mentioned in the background information. If Jane is not guilty, these severe injuries would be unexpected and more likely to be the result of natural causes or an accidental incident.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is not guilty is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely. These types of injuries are consistent with intentional smothering or other violent trauma, as mentioned in the background information. Given the other evidence pointing to Jane's potential culpability, the presence of these severe injuries strongly suggests that they were the result of intentional harm rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are likely if Jane is guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case is low. These types of injuries are more characteristic of intentional abuse and smothering, as mentioned in the background information. If Jane is not guilty, these severe injuries would be unexpected and more likely to be the result of natural causes or accidental factors, such as the resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy are likely if Jane is not guilty is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's case are highly likely. These types of injuries are indicative of intentional abuse and smothering, as mentioned in the background information. Given the other evidence pointing to Jane's potential culpability, the presence of these severe injuries strongly suggests that they were the result of intentional harm rather than natural causes or accidental factors.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy are likely if Jane is guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The timing of the onset of the hypoxic damage is more consistent with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes, which can lead to hypoxic brain injury over a longer period of time, rather than an acute, intentional incident. Without clear evidence of Jane's involvement, the temporal relationship between the brain injury and the time of death is more ambiguous.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage must have occurred shortly before death is consistent with intentional smothering or suffocation, which would lead to an acute, severe lack of oxygen to the brain. Given the other evidence pointing to Jane's potential culpability, the timing of the brain injury supports the hypothesis that it was the result of an intentional, recent act rather than a gradual, natural process.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is guilty is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the nature and timing of the injuries found in both children, and the lack of a clear alternative explanation for the deaths, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is high.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that Jane is guilty is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
