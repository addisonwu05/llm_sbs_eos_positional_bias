  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries at the time of admission suggests that they were either not visible or not present. Given the sudden nature of SIDS and the lack of a clear mechanism or cause, it is plausible that the injuries found during the autopsy could have occurred after Ben's death or were not visible to the medical staff.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The autopsy findings of rib and spinal cord injuries, as well as hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids, suggest that these injuries were present and likely contributed to Ben's death. It is less plausible that such significant injuries would have gone unnoticed by the medical staff, especially if they were the result of intentional harm.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is highly likely. The presence of the other injuries found on Ben, such as rib and spinal cord injuries, as well as the lack of petechiae or other signs of smothering, suggests that the cause of death may not have been due to intentional suffocation. In cases of SIDS, the absence of such typical smothering injuries is common.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is unlikely. In cases of intentional suffocation, the presence of petechiae and other signs of asphyxiation are commonly observed. The lack of these typical smothering injuries, despite the other injuries found on Ben, reduces the likelihood that Jane is guilty of intentionally causing his death.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are highly likely to be consistent with the resuscitation attempts. Babies, especially newborns, are fragile, and the process of trying to revive them can often lead to injuries such as bruises and torn tissues. Given the initial assessment that Andy's death was due to natural causes, and the lack of other evidence pointing to foul play, the injuries found in Andy can be reasonably attributed to the resuscitation efforts.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are less likely to be solely due to the resuscitation attempts. The presence of additional injuries, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, may suggest a pattern of intentional harm. In a scenario where Jane is guilty, these injuries could have been inflicted before or during the smothering of Andy, and the resuscitation attempts may have exacerbated or revealed these preexisting injuries.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were not indicative of intentional harm. The information provided suggests that these injuries can commonly occur in natural deaths or as a result of resuscitation attempts, which is consistent with a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In the absence of other clear evidence of foul play, the presence of these injuries does not necessarily imply that Jane is guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were solely due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is lower. In a scenario where Jane is guilty of intentionally harming Ben, these injuries could have been the result of the alleged smothering or other forms of physical abuse. The presence of these injuries, along with the other findings from the autopsy, would be more consistent with a case of intentional harm rather than a natural death.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are highly likely. The information provided indicates that both babies were around the same age, died at similar times of day, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities are not necessarily indicative of foul play, and could simply be coincidental occurrences in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is more common in young infants. In the absence of clear evidence of intentional harm, these similarities do not necessarily imply that Jane is guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are less likely to be coincidental. The fact that both babies were around the same age, died at similar times of day, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, suggests a pattern that would be more consistent with intentional harm rather than natural causes. The likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance in two separate incidents of SIDS is relatively low, and would lend more support to the hypothesis that Jane is guilty of intentionally causing the deaths of both children.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. In cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), there can be a period of reduced oxygen supply to the brain prior to the sudden and unexplained death of the infant. This hypoxic damage is not necessarily indicative of intentional harm, but rather a potential precursor to the sudden and unexpected death. If Jane is not guilty, this finding is more likely to be consistent with a natural SIDS-related event rather than a result of intentional smothering.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is lower. In a scenario where Jane intentionally harmed Ben, the hypoxic damage could have been a result of the alleged smothering, rather than a precursor to a natural SIDS-related event. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death would be more consistent with an intentional act of harm than a natural cause of death.\n\n40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse or smothering is low. The information provided states that these injuries were found upon re-examination of Andy's death, which was initially attributed to natural causes. In the absence of other clear evidence of foul play, these injuries could have been caused by the resuscitation attempts or other non-abusive factors, rather than being the result of intentional harm. If Jane is not guilty, these findings are less likely to be characteristic of smothering.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is high. The presence of these specific injuries, which were not initially noted, suggests a pattern of intentional harm that was overlooked or missed during the initial investigation. In a scenario where Jane is guilty, these findings would be more consistent with a case of intentional smothering of the infant, rather than natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is relatively low. These findings, while potentially indicative of intentional harm, can also occur in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. Without clear evidence of intentional smothering or other forms of abuse, these medical findings are less likely to be the result of criminal actions if Jane is not guilty.\n\n30",
