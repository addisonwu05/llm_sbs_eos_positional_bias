Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a well-known phenomenon that can account for the unexplained deaths of infants, and the lack of definitive signs of smothering is not uncommon in SIDS cases.\n\nThe fact that the autopsy found injuries to Ben's ribs, spinal cord, and brain, as well as hemorrhages in the eyes and eyelids, is concerning. However, these injuries do not necessarily indicate intentional smothering, as they could potentially be caused by other factors, such as resuscitation attempts or underlying medical conditions.\n\nMoreover, the finding of similar injuries in the autopsy of the first child, Andy, suggests that there may be an underlying medical explanation for the deaths, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the cause of death and the possibility of SIDS, the absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben's case is quite likely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n80"

The absence of these telltale signs would be unusual if Jane had indeed intentionally smothered Ben.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the absence of petechiae could be explained by other factors, such as the timing or method of the alleged smothering, or the possibility that the injuries were not caused by smothering at all. Additionally, the presence of other injuries, such as those found in Ben's case, could suggest a more complex scenario that does not necessarily involve classic signs of smothering.\n\nNonetheless, the lack of petechiae in a case of alleged intentional smothering would be considered relatively unlikely, as this is one of the more reliable indicators of this form of asphyxiation.\n\n30"
