  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe case details suggest that SIDS is a plausible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben. SIDS is a relatively common phenomenon, occurring in 1 in 4,000 cases in the UK, and it is more common in boys. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are also common findings in natural infant deaths and can occur during resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to her actions is quite high.\n\nThe case details suggest that Jane may have smothered both of her children, and the autopsy findings for Ben indicate injuries that are not consistent with natural causes or resuscitation attempts. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, along with the other injuries found, point to a non-accidental cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben due to her actions is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high.\n\nThe case details indicate that the injuries, including the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were only discovered during the autopsy. If Jane is not guilty, it is possible that these injuries occurred after Ben was transported to the hospital, either during resuscitation attempts or due to some other natural or accidental cause.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is more likely that the injuries, including the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, were present when he was brought to the hospital, but were not detected or properly documented by the nurses. The autopsy findings suggest non-accidental injuries, which would have been present at the time of the emergency response.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe case details indicate that the initial autopsy of Andy found that his death was due to natural causes, and the injuries observed, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, were attributed to the resuscitation efforts. Given that SIDS is a relatively common occurrence, and the injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby, this explanation is plausible if Jane is not guilty.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, may have been caused by Jane's actions rather than the resuscitation efforts. The fact that the initial autopsy attributed the injuries to natural causes or resuscitation does not necessarily mean they were not inflicted by Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben is quite high.\n\nGiven that SIDS is a plausible explanation for Ben's death, the absence of additional injuries beyond the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be expected. Smothering-related injuries like petechiae are not always present in SIDS cases, and the lack of such injuries does not necessarily indicate foul play.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the absence of additional injuries beyond the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be unexpected. Smothering often leads to the development of petechiae and other characteristic injuries, which were not found in Ben's case. This could suggest that the cause of Ben's death was not smothering, or that the method used by Jane did not result in the typical smothering-related injuries.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low.\n\nThe case details indicate that these injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death are characteristic of smothering and abuse. If Jane is not guilty, it would be unexpected for these types of injuries to be present in a natural death such as SIDS. The initial autopsy had attributed Andy's death to natural causes, and the additional findings during the re-examination suggest a non-accidental cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is:\n\n30%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents is quite high.\n\nThe case details indicate several striking similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, including their young age, the timing of the incidents, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These parallels could be explained by the possibility of both deaths being the result of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is more common among boys and often occurs shortly after feeding.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities between both incidents is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between both incidents is quite high.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering her children, the similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, such as their young age, the timing of the incidents, and the circumstances in which they were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would be expected. These parallels could indicate a pattern of behavior and a modus operandi in Jane's alleged criminal actions.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities between both incidents is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe case details suggest that these injuries are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would be unexpected if Jane is not guilty. Given the plausibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as an explanation for Ben's death, these specific injuries would not be a typical finding in a natural death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n30%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nIf the cause of death is SIDS, as suggested by the case details, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain may not have been caused a matter of hours before death. SIDS is a sudden and unexplained death, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The timing of the brain damage in relation to the time of death may not be as clear-cut as the doctor's allegation suggests.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is quite high.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death would be consistent with this scenario. Smothering or other forms of intentional suffocation would likely result in the observed brain damage in the hours leading up to Ben's death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n80%",
  "Based on the given evidence, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n60%",
