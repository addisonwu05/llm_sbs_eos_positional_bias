  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy are likely due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or the resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional smothering. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls. Additionally, the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\n\nGiven this information, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy, if Jane is not guilty, is 75%.\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are very likely to be the result of intentional smothering rather than natural causes or resuscitation attempts. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are consistent with signs of asphyxiation and are not typical of injuries from resuscitation alone.\n\nGiven this, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy, if Jane is guilty, is 95%.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben is quite likely. The presence of injuries like bruises, rib fractures, and brain damage suggest a more complex scenario, possibly involving SIDS or other medical conditions, rather than simple smothering.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae in Ben is less likely. Petechiae are a common sign of suffocation, and their absence would be unexpected if Jane had intentionally smothered Ben.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben, if Jane is guilty, is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The absence of these injuries being noted by the nurses suggests they may have occurred or worsened later on, possibly due to medical complications or other factors not related to intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is not guilty, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. If Jane had intentionally harmed Ben, it is more probable that the injuries would have been visible and noted by the medical staff upon his admission.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, if Jane is guilty, is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm. The information provided suggests that these injuries are commonly associated with natural infant deaths and are not necessarily indicative of foul play.\n\nGiven this, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is lower. While these injuries can occur in natural deaths or during resuscitation attempts, their presence in conjunction with the other evidence against Jane would make it less likely that they were purely due to natural causes or medical interventions.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, if Jane is guilty, is 40%.\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between both incidents are quite likely. The coincidence of both babies being around the same age, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could be explained by natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, if Jane is not guilty, is 80%.\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between both incidents are less likely to be a coincidence. The repeated pattern of the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane's involvement when they were found unconscious suggests a deliberate course of action, rather than a natural explanation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, if Jane is guilty, is 70%.\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is lower. These types of injuries are more commonly associated with smothering or other forms of intentional harm, rather than natural causes or accidental occurrences.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, if Jane is not guilty, is 40%.\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are highly likely to be the result of intentional smothering or other violent trauma. These types of injuries are strongly indicative of asphyxiation and are consistent with the allegations against Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, if Jane is guilty, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is lower. These injuries are more commonly associated with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than natural causes or accidental occurrences.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, if Jane is not guilty, is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is very high. These injuries are characteristic of smothering and abusive behavior, which would be consistent with the allegations against Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, if Jane is guilty, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is lower. The timeframe suggested by the doctor is more indicative of intentional harm rather than a natural or accidental occurrence.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, is 40%.\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high. The doctor's assessment that the brain damage occurred shortly before death is more consistent with intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the information provided, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is guilty, is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the injuries found in both babies, and the timing of the brain damage in Ben's case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%\n\n70%",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
