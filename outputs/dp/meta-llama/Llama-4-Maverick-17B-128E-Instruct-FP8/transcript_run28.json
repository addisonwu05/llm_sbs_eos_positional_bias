Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to understand the context and the nature of the injuries.\n\nFirst, let's consider the injuries found on Ben: injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are significant and serious injuries.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not due to her actions (e.g., smothering). In that case, there are a few possibilities to consider regarding the injuries on Ben:\n\n1. **The injuries could have occurred accidentally or due to another cause** before he was brought to the hospital. However, the nature of the injuries (to the ribs, spinal cord, etc.) suggests a significant force or trauma, which might not be easily explained by accidental injury or SIDS.\n\n2. **The injuries might have been sustained during or after resuscitation efforts** by medical personnel. Some of the injuries, such as rib injuries, could potentially be consistent with vigorous resuscitation attempts, although this is not universally accepted and can be a subject of medical debate.\n\n3. **The observation by nurses might not have included a thorough examination for these specific injuries**, or the injuries might not have been apparent at the time of admission.\n\nGiven that Jane is not guilty, for the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, one would have to consider that they either occurred during medical handling or were not detectable at the time.\n\nThe probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, assuming Jane is not guilty, hinges on whether there is an alternative plausible explanation for the injuries. If we consider that the injuries could potentially be a result of vigorous resuscitation or not immediately apparent, this scenario becomes more plausible.\n\nHowever, without explicit information on the handling and examination of Ben at the hospital, or a clear alternative explanation for the injuries, we must rely on the context given.\n\nThe injuries found on Ben are serious and not typical of SIDS or normal medical handling. The fact that they were not noted by nurses could suggest they were either not present or not detectable at the time.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming there is an alternative explanation for the injuries or that they were not detectable, one might still be cautious in attributing their absence at the hospital to the scenario that they were not present.\n\nThe probability judgment: 20"

The injuries found on Ben are indicative of significant trauma, which, in the context of Jane's guilt, would likely be attributed to her actions.\n\nFor the injuries not to have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane's guilt, we would have to consider a scenario where Jane's actions causing the injuries occurred after she called the ambulance or after Ben was taken to the hospital. However, this is highly implausible because it would mean Jane inflicted the injuries after realizing Ben was unwell and after calling for medical help, which is not a logical or likely sequence of events if she were guilty of causing his death through smothering or similar.\n\nIf Jane is guilty and caused Ben's injuries, it is most likely that these injuries were already present when she called for medical assistance. The fact that the nurses did not note the injuries could be due to various factors, such as the nature of the examination at the time or the subtlety of the injuries initially.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, as it contradicts the most straightforward interpretation of her guilt (i.e., that she caused the injuries before calling for help).\n\nThe probability judgment: 5"
