Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the context and the nature of the injuries.\n\nFirst, let's establish that if Jane is not guilty, then the cause of the deaths of both Andy and Ben could be attributed to other factors such as SIDS or other natural causes, or potentially other accidental or external factors not related to Jane's actions.\n\nThe injuries found on Ben include injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are serious and significant injuries that are typically associated with non-accidental trauma in the context of infant deaths.\n\nThe fact that these injuries were not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is an important detail. Nurses are trained professionals who conduct thorough examinations as part of their care. However, it's also known that not all injuries, especially those that are internal or not immediately visible, may be detected during an initial examination.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, then the assumption is that Ben's death and injuries could have occurred due to other reasons, not due to her actions. In such a case, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital hinges on the plausibility of the injuries occurring post-mortem or being missed by the medical staff.\n\nFor the injuries to have occurred post-mortem and not be related to Jane's actions, they would have had to happen after Ben was pronounced dead or during the handling of the body in a way that doesn't implicate Jane in causing them before death. However, the nature of the injuries (e.g., hypoxic damage, hemorrhages) suggests they occurred before death.\n\nThe alternative explanation is that the injuries were present but not detected by the nurses. Medical professionals might miss certain injuries, especially if they are not immediately visible or if the examination did not include specific tests to identify them.\n\nGiven that the injuries are of a serious nature typically associated with non-accidental injury and assuming Jane is not guilty, it strains credibility to suggest these injuries occurred post-mortem without any implication of Jane or someone else causing them. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty and assuming the injuries are genuine and not fabricated, it is more plausible that they were present but perhaps not immediately obvious or detected during the initial examination.\n\nHowever, if we are to consider the probability that these significant injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we are essentially evaluating the likelihood of an alternative explanation that doesn't implicate Jane.\n\nThe probability judgment here is based on the reasonableness of the injuries being missed or occurring post-mortem without implicating Jane. Given the nature of the injuries and typical medical practices, it seems less likely that such significant injuries would be entirely missed.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

The fact that they were not noted by nurses could be due to several factors, such as the nature of the injuries (some might not be immediately visible without specific examinations or tests) or the focus of the medical staff on resuscitation efforts rather than a detailed examination at the time of admission.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital. If Jane is guilty and responsible for Ben's injuries, it is contradictory to suggest that the injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as her guilt implies she caused the injuries before his death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.

The presence of other significant injuries (e.g., to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages) could be attributed to other causes or mechanisms that might not necessarily include smothering.\n\nThe likelihood of the absence of petechiae or other typical smothering injuries if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because it supports the notion that Ben's death might not have been due to smothering by Jane. Other causes, potentially accidental or natural, could be considered, and the absence of petechiae might be more consistent with these alternative explanations.\n\nMoreover, it's worth noting that the presence of petechiae is not universal in cases of smothering, and their absence does not definitively rule out asphyxiation or smothering. However, in the context of Jane not being guilty, the absence of these injuries might be seen as more plausible or consistent with alternative explanations for Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries is somewhat more likely or at least not contradictory to this premise.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

However, it's essential to consider that the presence of petechiae is not a universal finding in cases of smothering or asphyxiation. The occurrence of petechiae can depend on various factors, including the method and force used in smothering, the position of the infant, and individual physiological responses.\n\nThe fact that Ben had significant injuries, including those to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, indicates severe trauma. The absence of petechiae in the context of these other significant injuries does not necessarily contradict the possibility of smothering. Smothering can occur without leaving behind the typical signs like petechiae, especially if the act was carried out in a manner that did not cause significant resistance or struggle from the infant.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae is still a plausible scenario because it is not a required or definitive marker for smothering. The variability in how smothering can manifest and the range of possible injuries (or lack thereof) means that the absence of petechiae does not rule out smothering.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
