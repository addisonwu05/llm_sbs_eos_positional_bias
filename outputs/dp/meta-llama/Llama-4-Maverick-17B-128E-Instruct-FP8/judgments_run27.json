  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe cumulative weight of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of both babies, the presence of injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma, and the pattern of behavior that suggests a deliberate act, supports this verdict.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in a real court of law, the verdict would depend on the totality of the evidence presented, the arguments of both the prosecution and defense, and the jury's assessment of the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt."
