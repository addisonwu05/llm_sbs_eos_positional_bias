Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This implies that if Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of spinal bleeding could be expected and is not necessarily indicative of foul play.\n\nSecond, the dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts.

The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs can be attributed to the resuscitation efforts.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes, it is reasonably likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

The autopsy findings initially suggested injuries that could be associated with non-accidental injury, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which might be consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxia.\n\nHowever, the specific findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs have been explained in a manner that does not necessarily implicate Jane's guilt directly:\n1. The spinal bleeding is considered a common finding in natural death.\n2. The dislocated ribs are likely due to post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the critical question is whether the autopsy findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are likely. The information given does not directly link these specific findings to smothering or to Jane's actions if she were guilty. Instead, it offers alternative explanations that are not directly related to her guilt.\n\nTherefore, given that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs are attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling, the presence of these findings does not directly support or refute Jane's guilt in terms of smothering. They are somewhat incidental to the primary cause of death as alleged (smothering).\n\nThus, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these specific findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) is still plausible because they are explained by factors other than the act of smothering itself.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
