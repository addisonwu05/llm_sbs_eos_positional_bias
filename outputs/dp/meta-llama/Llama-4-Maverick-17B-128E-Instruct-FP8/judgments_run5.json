  "Based on the evidence presented, I must emphasize that a definitive verdict requires a thorough examination of all the evidence, expert testimonies, and a deep understanding of the legal standards for proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhile the probabilities assessed suggest a likelihood of guilt, they do not reach the threshold of certainty required for a guilty verdict in a criminal trial.\n\nTherefore, my verdict for the defendant is: Not guilty.\n\nThis verdict is based on the principle that the prosecution has not met the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nProbability judgment is not directly used to determine the verdict. However, my previous probability judgment was: 65 \n\nIt is worth noting that a real court would consider many other factors, including the credibility of witnesses, the reliability of forensic evidence, and the defendant's alibi, among others."
