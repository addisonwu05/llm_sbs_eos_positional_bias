  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I would conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThis verdict is based on the cumulative effect of the evidence, including the presence of injuries indicative of potential abuse or smothering on both children, the suspicious similarities between the two incidents, and the medical evidence supporting asphyxiation. While there are alternative explanations for some findings, the totality of the evidence suggests that Jane is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
