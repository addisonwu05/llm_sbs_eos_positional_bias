  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis provided, I would conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe cumulative evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of both babies, the presence of injuries consistent with abuse and smothering, and the suspicious circumstances, strongly suggests that Jane was responsible for the deaths of her children.\n\nWhile there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations for certain findings, the overall pattern and the weight of the evidence support a verdict of Guilty.\n\nVerdict: **Guilty**"
