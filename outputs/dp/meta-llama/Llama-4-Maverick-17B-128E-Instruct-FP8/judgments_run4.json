  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I would conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**. The cumulative weight of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, the presence of significant injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma, and the medical expert testimony, supports this verdict.\n\nWhile there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations for certain aspects of the evidence, the overall pattern and nature of the evidence presented suggest that Jane is responsible for the deaths of her children.\n\nVerdict: **Guilty**"
