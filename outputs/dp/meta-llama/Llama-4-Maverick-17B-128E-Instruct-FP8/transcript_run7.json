Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

It is stated that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death. If Jane is not guilty, it implies that the death of Ben could be due to natural causes or SIDS, as suggested in the background. Therefore, if Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, and spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, it is reasonable to expect that spinal bleeding could be found in Ben.\n\nSecond, regarding the dislocated ribs, it is mentioned that they probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, the implication is that Ben's death was not due to her actions (like smothering), and thus, the dislocated ribs, if resulting from resuscitation attempts, would be a plausible outcome regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence since resuscitation attempts were made.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, and assuming Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the findings of spinal bleeding (being common in natural death) and dislocated ribs (potentially due to resuscitation attempts) are plausible and not unexpected.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that these findings would be present if Jane is not guilty is relatively high because they can be explained by factors unrelated to Jane's guilt (natural death or SIDS, and medical intervention).\n\n80"

Additionally, the dislocated ribs are attributed to either post-mortem handling or resuscitation attempts, which are actions not directly related to Jane's guilt in terms of smothering.\n\nTherefore, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben, given Jane's guilt, is not necessarily directly related to her guilt. The spinal bleeding could be seen as coincidental or related to natural causes, and the dislocated ribs could be a result of the medical attempts to save Ben.\n\nGiven this, even if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the presence of these specific findings does not necessarily directly correlate with her guilt. However, it's worth noting that if Jane is guilty, the prosecution's case might rely more heavily on other evidence directly linking her actions to the cause of death.\n\nThus, the likelihood of these findings (spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs) being present is not strongly dependent on Jane's guilt in smothering, as they can be explained by other factors.\n\n70"
