  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I would state that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**. \n\nThis verdict is based on the cumulative effect of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths of both Andy and Ben, the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma, and the similarities between the two incidents. While there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations for certain findings, the overall pattern and evidence suggest that Jane is responsible for the deaths of her children.\n\n**Guilty**"
