Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

A torn frenulum typically occurs when there is a significant force applied to the mouth, such as forcibly feeding or, in some contexts, smothering. Nevertheless, it's also possible for such injuries to occur during vigorous resuscitation attempts.\n\nGiven the initial attribution of Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts, if we assume Jane is not guilty (and thus, not responsible for the injuries), it's plausible that the injuries could have occurred during the attempts to revive Andy.\n\nTo quantify the likelihood of these injuries under the assumption that Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability that the injuries were either due to resuscitation or another accidental cause.\n\nThe exact probability is difficult to quantify without specific statistical data on the frequency of such injuries during resuscitation attempts.
