  "Let's carefully analyze the evidence regarding Andy's injuries:\n\n1. Initial autopsy suggested natural causes of death\n2. Injuries initially attributed to resuscitation attempts\n3. Subsequent review found:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs\n   - Torn frenulum\n   - Blood in the lung\n\nWhile resuscitation can indeed cause injuries, the comprehensive nature of these findings raises questions. Specifically:\n- Multiple bruises in different locations\n- Torn frenulum (which is less likely from resuscitation)\n- Lung bleeding\n\nThe context of a second child's death also increases suspicion. However, the standard is \"beyond reasonable doubt\", and there's a plausible alternative explanation of resuscitation-related trauma.\n\nSIDS statistics (1 in 4,000) suggest some baseline probability of unexpected infant death. The medical explanations for the injuries being consistent with resuscitation cannot be completely dismissed.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the need to interpret evidence favorably for a \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario, and considering the potential for resuscitation-related injuries, I assess the likelihood of the injuries being consistent with non-intentional causes as:\n\n60",
  "Analyzing the evidence from a perspective assuming guilt:\n\n1. Injuries found:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in the lung\n\n2.
