  "To assess the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty, I'll consider several factors:\n\n1. The autopsy revealed significant injuries to Ben's ribs, spinal cord, brain, and eyes, which are unusual for a natural death.\n\n2. While petechiae are often associated with smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out smothering or other forms of fatal trauma.\n\n3. The discovery of multiple injuries suggests intentional harm, rather than a natural cause like SIDS.\n\n4. The coincidence of two infant deaths in the same family is extremely rare. The probability of two natural infant deaths in one family is statistically very low.\n\n5. The specific injuries found on Ben (rib and spinal cord damage) are more consistent with non-accidental trauma.\n\nConsidering these factors, the absence of petechiae alone would not strongly support Jane's innocence, given the other evidence of trauma. The probability that the absence of petechiae indicates Jane's non-involvement in Ben's death is relatively low.\n\nGiven the comprehensive medical evidence suggesting intentional harm, I would assess the probability of Jane's non-involvement based on the absence of petechiae as:\n\n25",
  "When considering the likelihood of the absence of petechiae if Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, several forensic and medical factors are important:\n\n1. Petechiae are common but not universal in smothering cases. Their presence is not a mandatory diagnostic marker.\n\n2. The mechanism of smothering can vary, and not all smothering episodes will produce identical forensic evidence.\n\n3. Ben's autopsy already revealed significant trauma (rib and spinal cord injuries, brain hypoxia, eye hemorrhages), suggesting intentional harm.\n\n4. Medical literature indicates that the absence of petechiae does not exclude the possibility of smothering, especially if other trauma is present.\n\n5. Forensic pathologists recognize that smothering can cause death through various mechanisms that might not always produce classic petechial signs.\n\n6. The specific injuries found on Ben are more indicative of deliberate trauma than accidental death.\n\nConsidering these medical and forensic nuances, if Jane is indeed guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae would still be reasonably expected in a proportion of cases.\n\n50",
  "To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts if Jane is not guilty, I'll consider several medical and forensic factors:\n\n1. Resuscitation injuries are indeed real and can cause:\n- Bruising to arms and legs\n- Potential soft tissue damage\n- Potential minor tissue tears\n\n2. Specific details noted in Andy's case:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n\n3. Resuscitation on infants can be particularly aggressive due to their fragility, potentially causing more pronounced injuries.\n\n4. Standard CPR and emergency medical procedures can reasonably explain some of these findings, especially in a high-stress infant emergency scenario.\n\n5. The initial medical examination accepted these injuries as consistent with resuscitation attempts, suggesting professional medical judgment initially saw no suspicious signs.\n\n6. The injuries, while present, do not inherently suggest deliberate harm when viewed through a medical lens focused on resuscitation context.\n\nConsidering these factors, and assuming Jane's innocence, the probability that these injuries are consistent with genuine resuscitation attempts is:\n\n75",
  "To assess the likelihood of Andy's injuries being consistent with Jane's guilt, I'll consider several forensic and medical factors:\n\n1. Specific injuries noted:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n\n2. These injuries are atypical for standard resuscitation:\n- Bruising pattern suggests potential direct trauma\n- Torn frenulum could indicate forceful handling or deliberate compression\n- Blood in lung might suggest internal trauma beyond resuscitation effects\n\n3. The presence of multiple injury types increases suspicion of intentional harm.\n\n4.

Medical professionals initially accepted these as resuscitation injuries, but subsequent review suggested potential non-accidental trauma.\n\n6. The injury pattern is more consistent with deliberate physical assault than accidental or medical intervention.\n\n7. The context of Jane being charged with murder suggests forensic experts found these injuries highly suspicious.\n\nConsidering these comprehensive factors, if Jane is guilty, the probability that these injuries represent non-accidental trauma rather than resuscitation effects is:\n\n85",
