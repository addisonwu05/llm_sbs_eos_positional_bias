  "Let's carefully analyze the evidence for Andy's case:\n\n1. Initial autopsy suggested natural causes of death\n2. Injuries found later included:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs\n   - Torn frenulum\n   - Blood in the lung\n\n3. Critical considerations:\n   - Resuscitation injuries are a plausible explanation for these findings\n   - Medical professionals initially attributed the injuries to resuscitation attempts\n   - The autopsy originally concluded natural causes\n\n4. Factors supporting potential alternative explanation:\n   - SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 cases\n   - More common in male infants\n   - No definitive mechanism for cause\n\n5. Key uncertainties:\n   - Exact nature and severity of injuries\n   - Precise timing and extent of resuscitation efforts\n   - Possible underlying medical conditions\n\nThe evidence suggests a significant probability that the injuries could be consistent with legitimate medical intervention, rather than deliberate harm. While not conclusive, the initial professional assessment and plausible alternative explanations create reasonable doubt about intentional injury.\n\nProbability that the injuries are NOT due to intentional harm: 85",
  "Analyzing the evidence for Andy's case from a guilt perspective:\n\n1. Injuries found:\n   - Bruises to arms and legs\n   - Torn frenulum\n   - Blood in the lung\n\n2. Context of subsequent investigation:\n   - Second child (Ben) died with clear signs of trauma\n   - Medical experts later re-examined Andy's case\n   - Pattern of two infant deaths under mother's sole care\n\n3. Injury characteristics:\n   - Bruises in multiple locations suggest systematic trauma\n   - Torn frenulum indicates potential forceful action\n   - Blood in lung could indicate smothering or physical assault\n\n4. Medical considerations:\n   - Initial resuscitation explanation becomes less credible\n   - Subsequent forensic review challenges original autopsy\n   - Consistent pattern with second child's death\n\n5. Forensic interpretation:\n   - Injuries appear more consistent with intentional trauma\n   - Multiple sites of injury suggest non-accidental harm\n   - Systematic pattern across both children's deaths\n\nGiven the cumulative evidence, the likelihood that these injuries represent intentional harm appears high, with strong forensic indicators pointing towards deliberate action.\n\n90",

Alternative explanation credibility:\n   - Medical professionals suggest these findings are not necessarily indicative of deliberate injury\n   - Consistent with medical intervention or natural post-mortem processes\n   - No definitive proof of intentional trauma\n\n5. Probabilistic assessment:\n   - High likelihood that these injuries could have innocent explanations\n   - Expert testimony supports non-malicious origin of findings\n\nThe evidence suggests a strong probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs could be the result of natural processes or medical intervention, rather than deliberate harm.\n\n85",

  "Analyzing the absence of petechiae in Ben's case from a non-guilt perspective:\n\n1. Typical smothering indicators:\n   - Petechiae (tiny red/purple spots)\n   - Expected in cases of suffocation/smothering\n   - Typically result from pressure and oxygen deprivation\n\n2.
