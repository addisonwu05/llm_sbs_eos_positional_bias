  "The question asks for an estimation of the likelihood of Andy's injuries *if Jane is innocent*. The injuries include bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. The key information is that these injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts. If Jane is innocent, it means Andy died of natural causes, presumably SIDS, and resuscitation attempts were made. Given this context, it's reasonably likely that resuscitation attempts caused at least some of these injuries. However, resuscitation does not guarantee such injuries, and the extent of the injuries may vary significantly. It seems reasonable to estimate a fairly high probability.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are less likely to be solely attributable to resuscitation attempts. While there might have been some attempts to revive him, the injuries could also be a direct result of the smothering itself or Jane's actions. Smothering may cause some trauma and subsequent bleeding, however bruising may not occur. So it's not certain that all of the injuries would be present if she smothered him.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death was due to other causes, most plausibly SIDS given the information. SIDS deaths are not typically associated with petechiae. Therefore, the absence of petechiae would be highly likely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae becomes more questionable, as petechiae can sometimes be present in smothering cases. However, petechiae are not *always* present in smothering cases. The likelihood depends on the specific method and circumstances of the smothering. Therefore it is uncertain.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben died of natural causes, most likely SIDS. The information states that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it's quite likely to find these things.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the spinal bleeding could be a consequence of the smothering, or it could still be due to natural causes *coincidentally*. The dislocated ribs could have occurred during the smothering, resuscitation attempts (if any), or post-mortem. Since the spinal bleeding is also a common finding in natural death, finding these injuries even if she is guilty is possible.\n\n65\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death was due to natural causes (SIDS). Some of the injuries found, like the spinal bleeding, are common in natural death. The dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation. If the injuries developed around the time of death, it is likely that the nurses wouldn't have noticed them when brought into hospital.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, she inflicted the injuries before bringing Ben to the hospital. The injuries were thus *present* when he was brought to the hospital. So, the likelihood that the injuries were *not* present would be low.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities would be a matter of chance. SIDS typically occurs in the first few months of life, especially during sleep after feeding. Given that Jane was the primary caregiver, it's not entirely unusual that she'd be alone with them and find them. While the similarities are striking, chance occurrences do happen.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities become much more likely, as it suggests a consistent pattern of behaviour and method. The fact that both children died at a similar age, time of day, after being fed, and when alone with Jane, strongly indicates a deliberate act.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, Ben died of SIDS. Hypoxic damage (low oxygen) to the brain would likely occur in the process of dying from SIDS a matter of hours before the death. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic damage would be a direct result of the smothering. Smothering restricts oxygen flow, leading to hypoxic brain damage. Since the doctor alleged that hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before death, which would match the time window of the smothering event, it is very likely.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, these injuries need to be explained by something other than abuse or smothering. It was mentioned earlier that some injuries could be consistent with resuscitation attempts, and the question says that these injuries are 'indicative' of abuse, implying that there could be other causes. However, it also says they are 'characteristic of smothering', which is more damning. The likelihood is probably on the lower side, as they suggest abuse and it's inconsistent that abuse was performed during resuscitation.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries are explained by the smothering. The question states that these injuries are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" Thus, if she is guilty, the injuries are more likely to be present.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben died of natural causes, namely SIDS. The information states that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. Therefore it's quite unlikely these symptoms occur in SIDS or any natural cause of death.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering, the injuries are consistent with that action. The question specifically states that \"hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering.\" Thus, if Jane is guilty, it is highly likely these injuries are present.\n\n90\n",
  "The evidence presents a mixed picture. On one hand, there are similarities in the deaths, the presence of injuries consistent with smothering, and the doctor's assessment of the timing of the hypoxic brain damage. This points toward guilt. On the other hand, SIDS is a known risk, some injuries could be attributed to resuscitation, and the absence of petechiae in Ben's case could be seen as mitigating evidence.\n\nConsidering all the factors, the similarities in the deaths when Jane was alone with both children are striking. I would consider it likely that the defendant is guilty.\n\n75\n",
  "Based solely on the evidence provided, the verdict is: Guilty\n"
