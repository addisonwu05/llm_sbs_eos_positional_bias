Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

We are asked to assess how likely the *absence* of petechiae is if Jane is *not guilty* of smothering Ben, meaning Ben died of some other cause.\n\nLet's consider possible alternative causes of death besides smothering. SIDS is a primary alternative presented in the case. Other possibilities, while not explicitly mentioned, could include undetected genetic conditions, metabolic disorders, or even extremely rare infectious diseases that might not present with typical signs of smothering.\n\nIf Ben died of SIDS or one of these other causes, it's perfectly plausible that typical injuries of smothering, such as petechiae, would be absent. SIDS, by definition, is unexplained. The other conditions I mentioned also usually do not involve petechiae as a symptom. The injuries *that were* found (rib fractures, spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage, hemorrhages) *could* point to smothering, but they don't *require* it. Some of these injuries could potentially be the result of other factors, especially in a fragile infant.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is *not guilty* of smothering, the absence of petechiae is quite probable.

Factors like the precise method of smothering, the duration, and the infant's physiology could influence whether petechiae are present.\n\nWhile petechiae are often associated with smothering, their absence doesn't definitively rule it out. A skilled perpetrator might be able to smother an infant in a way that minimizes or avoids leaving such marks. Perhaps a soft pillow was used briefly, rather than prolonged pressure. It's also possible that petechiae *were* present but were subtle and not readily apparent during the autopsy. Furthermore, the specific way the baby was handled may have been different from what is generally known as smothering.\n\nGiven these considerations, the absence of petechiae if Jane is guilty is still possible, but less likely than if she were innocent.

The similarities in the deaths, the specific injuries on Andy indicative of abuse, and the timing of Ben's brain damage all contribute significantly.
