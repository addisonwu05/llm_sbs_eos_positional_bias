Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries described on Ben are: injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability:\n\n*   **Nature of the Injuries:** Some of the injuries, like hypoxic damage, might be more likely to develop or worsen after arrival at the hospital, especially if resuscitation attempts were prolonged or initially ineffective. Other injuries, like rib fractures or spinal cord injuries, are less likely to spontaneously appear or worsen after arrival at the hospital. Hemorrhages could develop post mortem.\n*   **Nurse Observation Skills:** The nurses' failure to notice the injuries is significant. This could mean the injuries were subtle or masked by other medical issues. However, it's also possible the injuries were present but overlooked.\n*   **Time Delay:** The longer the delay between the alleged injury and the examination by nurses, the greater the possibility the injuries were not yet fully apparent.\n*   **Alternative causes:** Given the information provided, it is possible that some injuries are related to the resuscitation efforts, and were not intentionally inflicted.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it is unlikely, but not impossible, that the injuries were not present, or not obvious, when Ben was brought to the hospital.
