  "The absence of petechiae in a potential smothering case involving an infant is not definitive proof of innocence, nor is its presence definitive proof of guilt. The likelihood of petechiae appearing in a smothering case depends on various factors, including the method of smothering, the duration, and the infant's individual physiology. Some studies suggest that petechiae are not always present in smothering cases. The question asks for the probability that Jane is NOT GUILTY given the absence of injuries such as petechiae. It is difficult to say with certainty, but the injuries found on Ben are indicators of foul play, and the absence of petechiae does not guarantee that Jane did not smother the baby.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of petechiae doesn't rule out smothering entirely. Petechiae are not always present in cases of smothering. The exact likelihood of their absence when smothering occurs can vary widely. I would estimate a moderate probability that petechiae may not be present.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found on Andy are explained by the resuscitation attempts. The question states that such injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts would be quite likely.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the injuries found could be a combination of injuries inflicted by Jane during the smothering and injuries resulting from the subsequent resuscitation attempts. The extent to which the injuries are due to one versus the other is difficult to determine. However, the injuries *are* consistent with resuscitation attempts. Therefore, it is *possible* that some or all of the injuries could be attributed to resuscitation, even if Jane is guilty of smothering. The probability of finding such injuries is not negligible.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then either Ben died of SIDS or some other natural cause, or he was harmed *after* being brought to the hospital. Since the injuries were not noted by the nurses upon arrival, the injuries not being present at that time means they developed sometime after arrival. If the death was due to natural causes, the injuries discovered during the autopsy could have happened post-mortem or during unsuccessful resuscitation attempts (though the prompt doesn't say this explicitly). If Jane is not guilty, it is reasonably likely the injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, it means she inflicted the injuries on Ben *before* he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses didn't notice the injuries means one of two things: either the injuries were subtle enough to be missed, or the injuries were inflicted very shortly before arriving and were not yet apparent, or the nurses were negligent. Given that the injuries were significant enough to be detected during autopsy, it is less likely that they were *not* present at all. Therefore, the probability of the injuries *not* being present when brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding is attributed to natural death and the dislocated ribs are attributed to post-mortem causes or resuscitation attempts. The prompt states that the spinal bleeding \"is a common finding in natural death\" and that the dislocated ribs \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Therefore, given the information, it is highly likely that these findings would be present.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, it means she inflicted some other form of injury that led to Ben's death (smothering). The fact that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs likely occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts means that these findings could *also* be present even if the primary cause of death was smothering. The findings are consistent with other causes, and the other cause could have been the ultimate way that the death occurred.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then Ben's death would likely be attributed to something like SIDS or another natural cause. However, the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are explicitly stated as being \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" This suggests that if Jane is not guilty, then it is *unlikely* that these findings would be present, as they point towards violent trauma, and not natural death.\n\n20\n",
  "The hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma. If Jane is guilty, it means she committed smothering, a violent trauma. Therefore, it's highly likely that these findings would be present.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then the deaths of both babies were due to independent natural causes, like SIDS. While SIDS deaths do share some characteristics, it would be quite unusual for two separate incidents to have *so many* similarities: same age range, same time of day after feeding, and Jane being the sole caregiver present. The likelihood of all these similarities occurring by chance is low.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are highly indicative of a pattern and deliberate actions on Jane's part. The age of the babies, the timing after feeding, and Jane being alone with them all point to a planned method. Therefore, it is highly likely that these similarities would exist if she is guilty.\n\n95\n",
  "The prompt states that the injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, then these findings would be highly unlikely.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, and the injuries are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, then it is highly likely that these injuries would be present.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, Ben's death would have been caused by something else, most likely SIDS or another natural cause. The doctor's statement alleges that the hypoxic damage occurred within hours of death, and hypoxic damage is often associated with a lack of oxygen, therefore, in the case of SIDS, such damage in such a timeframe is reasonably likely.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic damage would have been caused by the smothering. Smothering would cause oxygen deprivation leading to hypoxic damage, and the damage would occur in the timeframe that Ben was being smothered, which would be very shortly before his death. Thus, it is highly likely the damage would have been caused a matter of hours before death.\n\n95\n",
  "Based on the evidence, the similarities between the two deaths, the injuries discovered during the autopsies (particularly after the re-examination of Andy's case), and the doctor's allegation about the timing of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the probability of Jane being guilty is substantial.\n\n85\n",
  "Given the evidence presented, and weighing the probabilities, the most likely verdict is:\n\nGuilty\n"
