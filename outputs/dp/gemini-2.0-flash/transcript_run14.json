Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This implies we are exploring scenarios where the injuries occurred *after* Ben was brought to the hospital, or were somehow missed initially.\n\nHere's a breakdown of factors influencing the probability:\n\n*   **Nurses' observation skills:** Nurses are trained to observe and document injuries. It's possible, but less likely, they missed clear and obvious injuries. The injuries were serious (ribs, spinal cord, brain damage, hemorrhages). These would likely present symptoms a nurse would notice.\n*   **Subtlety of injuries:** Some injuries might be subtle or masked by the child's condition. But spinal and rib injuries are often not subtle. Eye hemorrhages might also have been observable.\n*   **Timing of injuries:** If injuries occurred very shortly before death (e.g., during resuscitation attempts), it's *possible* they weren't present upon arrival. *However*, the autopsy revealed hypoxic brain damage, indicating a period of oxygen deprivation *before* death.\n*   **\"Not guilty\" scenarios:** if Jane is not guilty, this could be because Ben was murdered by someone else (implying the injuries were inflicted before the ambulance was called); the injuries were the result of an accident, or that SIDS happened while Jane was nearby.\n*   **SIDS:** SIDS itself does not cause these types of injuries, so SIDS isn't a possible explanation.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems improbable that all of Ben's injuries were *not* present upon arrival. Some injuries might have been missed or occurred very close to the time of death, but the combination of injuries suggests inflicted trauma before arrival.\n\nProbability: 10\n"

It could be a different mechanism caused the injuries and death.\n*   **Presence of other injuries:** The existing injuries (ribs, spinal cord, brain damage, hemorrhages) are concerning and unusual in isolation. They suggest trauma, which makes a simple alternative explanation less likely.\n*   **Expert testimony:** Expert testimony could be crucial. Are there documented cases of similar injuries occurring without petechiae in other contexts? How common is it to *not* find petechiae when there are other signs of trauma?\n*   **Severity and mechanism of smothering:** The absence of petechiae might suggest a different mechanism from classic smothering. For example, if the child was suffocated in a way that didn't cause significant pressure on blood vessels in the head and neck, petechiae might be absent. This is less likely if the injuries are due to another cause of death.\n\nConsidering that Jane is *not guilty*, the absence of petechiae is moderately likely because something else caused the injuries.

Attributing the injuries to resuscitation is a way to do that.
