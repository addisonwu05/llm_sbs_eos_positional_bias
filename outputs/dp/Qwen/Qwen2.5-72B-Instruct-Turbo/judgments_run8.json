  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the injuries and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Andy and Ben, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis verdict is based on the high probability that the injuries and the striking similarities between the two incidents are indicative of intentional harm, aligning with the act of smothering. However, it is important to note that a final determination should be made by a court of law."
