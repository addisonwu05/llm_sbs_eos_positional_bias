Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben could be due to several factors. Petechiae are often, but not always, present in cases of smothering. The absence of petechiae does not definitively rule out smothering, as the pressure and duration of the smothering, the infant's state of health, and other variables can influence whether these marks appear.\n\nHowever, the absence of petechiae can also support the possibility of other causes of death, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which typically does not leave such marks. Given that SIDS is a recognized and not uncommon cause of infant death, the absence of petechiae in Ben would be more consistent with SIDS than with smothering.\n\nConsidering the above, if Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae in Ben is relatively likely, as it aligns with the possibility of SIDS, which does not typically cause these injuries. However, the presence of other injuries, such as rib and spinal cord injuries, hypoxic damage, and hemorrhages, complicates this assessment and makes it less certain.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with Jane not being guilty is estimated to be around 60%.\n\n60"

However, it is not a specific indicator of smothering and can be present in both natural and non-natural deaths.\n\n2. **Dislocated Ribs**: Dislocated ribs can occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, but they can also be a result of physical abuse.
