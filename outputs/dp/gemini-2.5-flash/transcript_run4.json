Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This could mean two things:\n    *   The injuries *were present* when Ben arrived but were internal, subtle, or required specific diagnostic procedures (like an autopsy) to be discovered. This is common for many internal injuries.\n    *   The injuries *were not present* when Ben arrived and developed sometime *after* his arrival at the hospital (e.g., during medical procedures like resuscitation efforts).\n\n4.  **Evaluating the likelihood of injuries developing *after* arrival (Scenario 2):**\n    *   **Resuscitation Efforts:** While vigorous resuscitation can sometimes cause injuries like rib fractures, it is highly improbable for resuscitation alone to cause the entire constellation of injuries described, especially:\n        *   **Spinal cord injuries:** While possible in extreme cases of mishandling, it's not a typical outcome of standard resuscitation.\n        *   **Hypoxic brain damage:** This condition usually occurs *before* resuscitation is needed, and is the reason for resuscitation. While resuscitation might fail to reverse it or even worsen it if prolonged and ineffective, it's not the primary cause of the initial hypoxic damage itself.\n        *   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids (especially retinal haemorrhages):** These are considered strong indicators of non-accidental trauma, such as abusive head trauma or traumatic asphyxia (smothering), and are very rarely, if ever, attributed solely to standard resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the specific and severe nature of the combined injuries, particularly the eye haemorrhages and spinal cord trauma, it is highly unlikely that they *all* developed as a consequence of medical intervention *after* Ben arrived at the hospital.\n\nTherefore, the most probable scenario is that these injuries were already present when Ben was brought to the hospital but were internal or not immediately apparent, and thus \"not noted by nurses.\" If the injuries *were* present upon arrival, then the probability that they were *not present* is very low.\n\nConsidering the remote possibility of some injuries being caused or exacerbated by resuscitation (though unlikely for the full spectrum), a very small probability can be assigned.\n\n5\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$"

If spinal bleeding is a *common* finding in natural death, then it's highly likely to be present if Ben died naturally.\n2.  \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Ben died and underwent resuscitation efforts.

Trauma, especially around the head and neck, can lead to spinal injuries, including bleeding. The initial autopsy report already mentioned \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord.\" Spinal bleeding is a specific manifestation of spinal cord injury. Therefore, even in a case of death by smothering (traumatic), spinal bleeding could be present either as a direct result of the trauma or as a co-occurring finding.\n\n2.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben would still have undergone resuscitation attempts. Resuscitation efforts are a well-known cause of rib injuries, including dislocations. Such injuries occurring during resuscitation are independent of the cause of death itself but are a consequence of the medical attempts to save the child. Post-mortem changes could also occur regardless of the cause of death.\n\nGiven that resuscitation attempts would have occurred regardless of Jane's guilt, and these attempts \"probably\" cause dislocated ribs, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly likely. Similarly, while spinal bleeding is common in natural death, it doesn't exclude its presence in a traumatic death like smothering, especially since the initial report indicated spinal cord injuries.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, these findings are still very likely to be present and reported.\n\n90"

Therefore, their *absence* (even if possible) would be a less expected or less common outcome if smothering indeed occurred.\n\nWhile it is known that petechiae are not present in 100% of smothering cases (factors like the duration of asphyxia or the child's response can influence their appearance), their description as \"typical\" suggests that they are present in a significant majority of cases. If they are present in, for example, 70-80% of smothering cases, then they would be absent in 20-30% of cases.\n\nThus, if Jane is guilty, the absence of a \"typical\" finding like petechiae is possible but not the most probable scenario. The probability should reflect that it is less likely for this typical sign to be absent when the cause of death is indeed smothering.\n\n25"

If this is a fatal event, the child will quickly become unresponsive and may die within minutes. However, it is also very common in cases of severe traumatic asphyxia or head injury (which can lead to hypoxia) for an infant to suffer severe brain damage but not die instantly. In such scenarios:\n1.  The initial hypoxic insult (the smothering event) might occur.\n2.  The child might then suffer severe brain damage but survive for a period.\n3.  The child is then discovered, an ambulance is called, and they are transported to the hospital.\n4.  Resuscitation efforts might be attempted and eventually fail.\n5.  Death is pronounced hours after the initial causative event, or the irreversible hypoxic damage is medically assessed as having occurred hours before the final pronouncement of death.\n\nTherefore, even if the act of smothering is relatively acute, the resulting irreversible hypoxic damage (which is what the doctor would be assessing) could indeed be determined to have been caused \"a matter of hours before death\" due to the progression of brain injury, the period of medical intervention, or the time elapsed between the initial insult and the final cessation of life. This timeframe is entirely consistent with severe inflicted injury leading to a protracted decline or a period of survival with severe damage.\n\nGiven that Jane is guilty and caused the hypoxic damage, it is highly likely that this damage, particularly severe damage leading to death, would be diagnosed as having occurred \"a matter of hours before death\" by medical professionals, even if the precise act of smothering was more acute.\n\n90"
