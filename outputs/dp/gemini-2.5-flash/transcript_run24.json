Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This tells us that petechiae were *absent* in Ben.\n\nThe question asks: \"If Jane is GUILTY, how likely is the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben?\" This is asking for the probability of observing no petechiae, given that smothering occurred.\n\nSince petechiae are described as \"typical injuries\" of smothering, their absence is an *atypical* finding. An atypical finding means it occurs less frequently than the typical finding (presence of petechiae). Therefore, the probability of petechiae being absent, given that smothering occurred, should be relatively low, but not zero (as it did happen in Ben's case, suggesting it's possible).\n\nIf petechiae are \"typical,\" they would be present in a majority of smothering cases (e.g., 70-90%). Consequently, their absence would occur in a minority of cases (e.g., 10-30%).\n\nConsidering that the absence of petechiae is noted as a specific detail that goes against the \"typical\" pattern, it suggests a probability towards the lower end of this range.\n\n20"

    "content": "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben died due to smothering. We need to evaluate the likelihood of finding both spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs under this assumption.\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" The case background clearly indicates that \"Ben could not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead,\" meaning resuscitation attempts *did* occur. Therefore, regardless of whether the death was natural or due to smothering, the dislocated ribs are highly probable due to these resuscitation efforts. We can assign a high probability to this, e.g., around 90%.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text explicitly states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death.\" If Ben was smothered (i.e., Jane is guilty), his death was not a natural death. If spinal bleeding is a \"common finding\" in natural death, it implies that it is *less common* or *less typical* in deaths caused by smothering. While not impossible, its presence would be less expected in a smothering case compared to a natural death. Therefore, the probability of finding spinal bleeding, given that Ben was smothered, would be relatively low, but not zero (as it was found). Let's estimate this as significantly lower than the probability for natural death, perhaps in the range of 20-30%.\n\nCombining these two probabilities (assuming they are largely independent, as one is linked to post-mortem/resuscitation events and the other to the cause of death relative to natural causes):\nProbability (Dislocated Ribs | Guilty) ≈ 0.90\nProbability (Spinal Bleeding | Guilty) ≈ 0.25 (as it's less expected than in natural death)\n\nThe joint probability would be approximately 0.90 * 0.25 = 0.225.\n\n23"

The text states that \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" The question asks about the likelihood that these injuries were *not present* at the time Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nLet's break down the injuries:\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text explicitly states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Since Ben could not be resuscitated, resuscitation attempts definitely occurred. These attempts would have taken place either en route to the hospital or after arrival. Therefore, it is highly probable that the dislocated ribs were *not present* when Ben was initially brought to the hospital, but rather developed during or after these attempts.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding and hypoxic damage to the brain:** These are internal injuries. Even if they were present upon arrival (which is likely if the death was natural and the baby was \"unwell\"), they would not typically be \"noted by nurses\" during an initial visual assessment upon arrival in an emergency situation. The question, however, asks if they were \"not present.\" If Jane is not guilty and Ben died of natural causes, these internal pathologies (spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death, and hypoxic damage being a consequence of a terminal event) would likely have been developing or present internally at the time of arrival, even if not externally noted. So, for these specific injuries, it is less likely that they were \"not present.\"\n\n3.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These can be external (eyelids) or internal (retinal). Similar to spinal bleeding and hypoxic damage, they might have been present (e.g., as part of the natural terminal event or even subtle and missed) but not noted, or they could have developed/worsened during the acute phase or resuscitation. It's less definitive that they were \"not present\" compared to the ribs.\n\nThe question refers to \"the injuries found on Ben\" (plural). If even one significant injury (like the dislocated ribs) was highly likely not present upon arrival, then the *full set* of injuries as identified at autopsy was not present. Given the very high probability that the dislocated ribs were not present when Ben arrived at the hospital, this significantly increases the likelihood that \"the injuries found on Ben\" were not present at that specific time. While other internal injuries might have been present but simply not noted, the strong evidence regarding the ribs makes the overall statement very likely.\n\n90"

Therefore, these specific injuries *would have been present* when Ben was brought to the hospital, as they are the direct consequences of the lethal act.\n\n2.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" The background confirms that Ben \"could not be resuscitated either,\" indicating resuscitation attempts were made.
