    "content": "Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of\nthe case:\nAfter Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.\nWhen Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to\nbed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "The question asks for the likelihood of the absence of petechiae in Ben, *given that Jane is NOT GUILTY*.\n\nLet's break down the implications:\n\n1.  **\"Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: This is a stated fact from the case background: \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\"\n\n2.  **\"If Jane is NOT GUILTY\"**: This means that Jane did not smother Ben. If Jane did not smother Ben, then Ben's death was caused by something else. There are two main possibilities for Ben's death, consistent with Jane being not guilty of smothering:\n    *   **Scenario A: Ben was not smothered at all.** This could be due to SIDS (which is explicitly mentioned as an alternative explanation), another natural cause, or an accident not involving smothering.\n    *   **Scenario B: Ben was smothered, but by someone else.**\n\nNow let's evaluate the likelihood of \"absence of petechiae\" under these two scenarios:\n\n*   **Under Scenario A (Ben was not smothered at all)**: If Ben was not smothered, then petechiae (a typical sign of smothering) would not be expected. Therefore, the absence of petechiae is 100% likely in this scenario.\n\n*   **Under Scenario B (Ben was smothered by someone else)**: The text states that petechiae are \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering\". If an injury is typical, its absence in a case where the cause *did* occur means it's an atypical presentation. So, if Ben was smothered (even by someone else), the absence of petechiae would be less likely (i.e., less than 50% likely, as \"typical\" implies presence in the majority of cases).\n\nThe question essentially asks us to consider how plausible the observed absence of petechiae is, given the hypothesis of Jane's innocence.\n\nThe absence of petechiae is a finding that **weakens the evidence for smothering** (whether by Jane or anyone else). If smothering is less likely to have occurred, then it is more likely that Jane is not guilty of smothering. Conversely, if Jane is not guilty, it implies that the evidence for smothering (by her) was not convincing. The absence of a \"typical\" sign like petechiae would contribute significantly to that lack of convincing evidence.\n\nTherefore, the observed absence of petechiae **aligns well** with the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty. It makes the \"not guilty\" verdict more plausible, especially if the reason for \"not guilty\" is that Ben was not smothered at all (Scenario A).\n\nWhile the other severe injuries found on Ben (ribs, spinal cord, hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages) make a pure SIDS/natural death explanation difficult without further clarification, the question specifically focuses on the *absence of petechiae*. The absence of this \"typical\" smothering injury provides reasonable doubt regarding smothering as the cause of death. If smothering did not occur, then Jane is not guilty, and the absence of petechiae is 100% expected.\n\nGiven that the absence of petechiae is a finding that directly supports a \"not guilty\" verdict (by weakening the case for smothering), it is highly likely that such a finding would be present if Jane is indeed not guilty. It would be a significant factor contributing to reasonable doubt.\n\nConsidering that the absence of petechiae makes the \"not smothered at all\" scenario more likely, and that this scenario leads to 100% likelihood of petechiae absence, the overall probability, given Jane is not guilty, is high. It's not 100% because the alternative (smothering by someone else, where absence is atypical) is still possible, but the very fact of the absence of petechiae supports the not guilty hypothesis.\n\n85"
