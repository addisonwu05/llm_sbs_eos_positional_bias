Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

This sequence of events means that resuscitation attempts would almost certainly have been made by emergency personnel and hospital staff. The text states: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Therefore, the injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts are highly likely to occur.\n\n2.  **Direct Effect of Smothering/Struggle**: While the injuries are \"consistent with resuscitation,\" it is also plausible that some of these injuries could be a direct result of the act of smothering itself or the baby's struggle against it.\n    *   **Bruises to arms and legs**: Could occur if the baby struggled against being held down or restrained during smothering.\n    *   **Torn frenulum**: Could result from trauma to the mouth area, perhaps from a hand being pressed firmly over the mouth during smothering, or the baby biting down hard in distress.\n    *   **Blood in the lung**: Could be related to the severe asphyxia (lack of oxygen) caused by smothering, leading to pulmonary hemorrhage, or aspiration of blood during the struggle.\n\nThe fact that these injuries were identified in a *subsequent* review of Andy's autopsy photographs, after Ben's clear signs of trauma were found, and that this led to Jane being charged with murder by smothering, suggests that these injuries *can also be interpreted* as consistent with abuse or the act of smothering, even if they initially had an innocent explanation.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of finding these injuries is high because:\n*   Resuscitation attempts would still occur and are known to cause such injuries.\n*   The act of smothering itself and the associated struggle could also contribute to or directly cause some of these injuries.\n\nHaving two potential mechanisms (smothering/struggle *and* resuscitation) makes the presence of these injuries *more* likely than if only one mechanism (resuscitation after natural death) were at play.\n\n95"

In this scenario, emergency services would have been called and resuscitation attempts would have been made.\n\nLet's break down the likelihood of each type of injury being \"not present\" when Ben was brought to the hospital, given Jane is not guilty:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs**: The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" In either case, these injuries would occur *after* Ben was brought to the hospital (resuscitation happens after arrival, and post-mortem means after death, which occurred at or after arrival). Therefore, it is highly likely that the dislocated ribs were *not present* when Ben was initially brought to the hospital.\n2.  **Spinal bleeding**: The text states this \"is a common finding in natural death.\" If it's a finding in a natural death, it would likely be present *at the time of the natural death event* or shortly after, meaning it would likely *be present* when Ben was brought to the hospital. So, it is unlikely this specific injury was *not present* at arrival.\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This is a direct consequence of the lack of oxygen that leads to death. If Ben died of natural causes, this damage would have occurred or been occurring *before or at the time* he was brought to the hospital. So, it is highly likely this injury *was present* at arrival.\n4.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These can result from the terminal event of natural death (e.g., severe physiological stress) or from resuscitation efforts. If caused by resuscitation, they would not be present upon initial arrival. If caused by the natural terminal event, they would be present. Therefore, it is plausible that some or all of these haemorrhages were *not present* at the exact moment of arrival.\n\nConsidering \"the injuries found on Ben\" as a collective set, if Jane is not guilty:\n*   At least one significant injury (dislocated ribs) was almost certainly *not present* at the time of arrival.\n*   Other significant injuries (spinal bleeding, hypoxic brain damage) were likely *present* at the time of arrival.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood that \"the injuries... were not present.\" Since a key finding, the dislocated ribs, was highly likely *not present* at arrival, this contributes significantly to the overall likelihood that the *full picture* of injuries discovered at autopsy was not yet formed or complete upon initial presentation. The fact that nurses \"noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\" also supports that the injuries were not obvious or fully developed at that initial stage.\n\nTaking into account that some injuries were likely present, but a significant, physically traumatic one (dislocated ribs) was likely not present upon arrival, the probability is moderately high that the complete set of injuries found at autopsy was not fully present when Ben was first brought to the hospital.\n\n70"

Following this, she would have called an ambulance, and Ben would have been taken to the hospital where resuscitation attempts would have occurred.\n\nLet's consider each type of injury mentioned:\n\n1.  **Injuries to the ribs (dislocated ribs)**: The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben would still have undergone resuscitation at the hospital. Therefore, it is highly likely that the dislocated ribs would *not* have been present when Ben was initially brought to the hospital, as they would develop during the resuscitation process.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding**: The text states this \"is a common finding in natural death.\" While Ben's death would be due to smothering (not natural), severe asphyxia (lack of oxygen) from smothering could potentially cause similar physiological stress and internal bleeding. If caused by the act of smothering itself, this injury *would* be present when Ben was brought to the hospital. However, as an internal injury, it would not be \"noted by nurses\" upon initial visual examination.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to the brain**: This is a direct consequence of the lack of oxygen caused by smothering. This damage *would* be present when Ben was brought to the hospital, having occurred during the act of smothering. As an internal injury, it would not be \"noted by nurses.\"\n\n4.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These can result from the increased venous pressure during asphyxiation (smothering), meaning they would be present upon arrival. Alternatively, they can also be caused by vigorous resuscitation efforts (e.g., intubation, chest compressions), in which case they would *not* be present upon arrival.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood that \"the injuries found on Ben were *not present* when he was brought to the hospital.\"\n\n*   The dislocated ribs, a major traumatic injury, were almost certainly *not present* upon arrival as they occur during resuscitation.\n*   Some of the eye/eyelid haemorrhages might also not have been present, depending on their cause.\n*   The spinal bleeding and hypoxic brain damage *would* have been present upon arrival, having been caused by the smothering. However, these are internal injuries and would not typically be \"noted by nurses\" on initial assessment.\n\nThe fact that \"nurses when he was brought to the hospital\" did *not note* these injuries is significant. If Jane is guilty, the most externally obvious traumatic injury (dislocated ribs) would not yet have occurred. The internal injuries (hypoxic brain, spinal bleeding) would be present but not externally visible. Therefore, it is highly likely that the injuries, *as they would later be fully identified in the autopsy and particularly the traumatic ones that would have been noticeable if present*, were either not present yet (ribs) or not externally observable and thus not \"noted by nurses\" upon Ben's arrival.\n\nGiven that at least one significant injury (dislocated ribs) was highly likely not present at arrival, and the internal nature of others means they wouldn't be 'noted' externally, it's very likely that the full picture of injuries, or at least the externally identifiable ones, were not present/noted upon arrival.\n\n80"

The question asks how likely it is to find these specific similarities between the two incidents under this assumption.\n\nLet's analyze each similarity in the context of SIDS:\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died (Andy 11 weeks, Ben 8 weeks):** The peak incidence of SIDS occurs between 2 and 4 months (8 to 16 weeks). Both Andy and Ben fall squarely within this high-risk age window. If two SIDS deaths occurred, it is quite likely they would be in this common age range.\n2.  **They both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed:** SIDS deaths frequently occur during sleep, and infants are often put to bed after a feeding. This circumstance is also very common for SIDS fatalities.\n3.  **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** If Jane is the primary caregiver, it is highly probable that she would be the one to discover an unconscious child, and it is common for a parent to be alone with their child at home, particularly during sleep periods.\n\nWhile each of these similarities individually aligns with common characteristics of SIDS, the co-occurrence of *all three* highly specific similarities in two separate, rare events (SIDS has a frequency of 1 in 4,000, and two SIDS deaths in one family are exceptionally rare) makes the combination statistically unlikely to happen purely by chance. The term \"astonishing\" in the prompt explicitly indicates that these similarities are considered highly improbable if they are merely coincidental. If something is astonishing, its likelihood of occurring by chance is low.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, these highly similar circumstances represent a profound and statistically improbable coincidence for two independent natural deaths.\n\n20"
