Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Following this, Ben would have been found unconscious, and resuscitation attempts would have been made by Jane, paramedics, and hospital staff.\n\nLet's analyze the likelihood of each injury in this scenario:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben died and resuscitation attempts *definitely* occurred (\"Ben could not be resuscitated\"). Post-mortem changes also *definitely* occurred. Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly probable in this scenario.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states this \"is a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was *not* natural; it was caused by smothering. This implies that while spinal bleeding is common in natural death, its presence is *less likely* if the death is unnatural (e.g., due to smothering) than if it were natural. However, \"common\" does not mean exclusive, and severe hypoxia (from smothering) or vigorous resuscitation efforts could still potentially lead to spinal bleeding or contribute to it. Furthermore, the fact that \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\" were among the findings that led to the murder charge suggests these injuries are considered by the prosecution to be consistent with, or at least not contradictory to, death by smothering.\n\nConsidering both injuries:\n*   The dislocated ribs are highly probable due to the certain occurrence of resuscitation attempts.\n*   The spinal bleeding is less probable than in a natural death, but not impossible, as severe hypoxia or resuscitation trauma could contribute.\n\nGiven that these findings (including \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\") led to the murder charge, they are presented as being consistent with Jane's guilt. Therefore, the likelihood of finding them if Jane is guilty should be moderate to high, but lower than if the death was natural (as in the \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario, where spinal bleeding is explicitly \"common\").\n\nTaking these factors into account, the overall likelihood is reduced from the \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario (which was 90), but remains plausible.\n\n65"

It would not be externally visible or noted by nurses upon arrival.\n*   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These can be caused by asphyxia (smothering). While they *could* be present upon arrival, they can be subtle, or develop/worsen during resuscitation. Given the chaotic nature of an emergency resuscitation, and the focus on vital signs, subtle hemorrhages might easily be overlooked by nurses.
