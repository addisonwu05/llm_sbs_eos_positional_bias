Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The injuries found on Ben (injuries to ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) must therefore have an alternative explanation.\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood that these injuries were *not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital. This implies they developed *after* arrival at the hospital, most likely due to resuscitation attempts, as no other post-arrival trauma is suggested.\n\nLet's consider the likelihood of each type of injury developing during resuscitation:\n*   **Rib injuries:** Resuscitation efforts, especially CPR on an infant, can cause rib fractures. So, it is plausible these were *not present* on arrival and developed in the hospital.\n*   **Spinal cord injuries:** While less common than rib fractures, spinal cord injuries can potentially occur during vigorous resuscitation of a fragile infant. So, it is possible these were *not present* on arrival.\n*   **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** Ben was described as \"unwell\" and \"could not be resuscitated.\" This indicates he suffered severe oxygen deprivation *before* or *during* transport to the hospital. Hypoxic damage is a consequence of this deprivation. While the full extent of the damage might only be confirmed post-mortem, the *process* of hypoxia and the onset of damage would have almost certainly begun *before* he arrived at the hospital. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this specific type of \"injury\" was entirely *not present* upon arrival.\n*   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These are often associated with severe anoxia, increased pressure (e.g., during asphyxia), or trauma. While some resuscitation maneuvers might contribute, it is less common for *all* such haemorrhages to appear de novo *during* standard resuscitation efforts. It's more likely they would be a result of the initial event causing the collapse.\n\nGiven that \"the injuries\" (plural) are in question, and some of them (specifically the hypoxic brain damage and likely the eye haemorrhages) are highly improbable to have been entirely absent upon arrival and then developed solely within the hospital, the overall likelihood that *all* of \"the injuries\" were *not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital is low. It is more probable that at least some of these injuries were already present (even if not noted by nurses due to the emergency context or their internal nature) and others (like rib fractures) could have been a result of resuscitation.\n\n25"

The injuries found on Ben (injuries to ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids) are the direct or indirect consequences of this smothering.\n\n1.  **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** This is a primary consequence of smothering (asphyxia). The process of oxygen deprivation and subsequent brain damage would begin during the act of smothering and persist until death or successful resuscitation (which didn't happen here). Therefore, this damage would undeniably be present when Ben was brought to the hospital, as it's the result of the initial fatal event.\n2.  **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These are also typically associated with asphyxia and increased pressure that occurs during smothering. They would be expected to be present at the time Ben collapsed due to smothering.\n3.  **Injuries to ribs and spinal cord:** While these could potentially be caused by forceful resuscitation attempts, they could also be inflicted during the act of smothering itself (e.g., forceful restraint). If they are part of the evidence for smothering, they would have been caused prior to hospitalization.\n\nGiven that Jane is GUILTY, she caused these injuries (or the events that led to them) *before* Ben was brought to the hospital.

It implies the damage was not long-standing.\n2.  **Period of Insult:** The \"hours\" could encompass the entire period of the acute hypoxic insult, from the initial act of smothering, through any struggle, to the moment of brain death, even if the final moments were rapid.\n3.  **Pathological Development:** It's possible for some pathological changes in the brain resulting from acute hypoxia to become evident or datable over a few hours post-insult, even if the insult itself was shorter.\n\nGiven that hypoxic damage is a direct and expected consequence of smothering, and \"a matter of hours\" signifies a recent, acute event, it is plausible that a medical expert would make such an allegation even in a smothering case. While \"minutes\" might seem more precise for an instantaneous fatal act, \"hours\" is consistent with an acute event leading to death and distinguishes it from chronic conditions.\n\nTherefore, it is quite likely that this allegation would be made and considered consistent with smothering.\n\n75"
