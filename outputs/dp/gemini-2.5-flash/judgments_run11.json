  "The question asks for the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were *not present* when he was brought to the hospital, *given that Jane is not guilty*.\n\n1.  **Nature of the injuries:** The injuries found on Ben include \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\" These are severe, acute injuries typically associated with significant trauma, suffocation, or a catastrophic event.\n2.  **Timing of injuries:** These types of injuries do not spontaneously develop or manifest significantly *after* a child has been brought to the hospital and pronounced dead, but *before* an autopsy.\n    *   **Rib and spinal cord injuries:** These are structural injuries resulting from physical force. If they caused or contributed to Ben's collapse, they would have been present at that time.\n    *   **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** This is the result of a period of severe oxygen deprivation. If this led to his death, the deprivation occurred before or during his collapse, meaning the damage would be established by the time he arrived at the hospital. It wouldn't develop post-admission unless a separate, severe hypoxic event occurred *within* the hospital, which is not suggested.\n    *   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These are acute signs often associated with trauma or suffocation and would typically be present when the injury occurred.\n3.  **Nurses' observation:** The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" This fact indicates that the nurses *failed to detect or document* the injuries at the time, not that the injuries *did not exist*. In an emergency, nurses' primary focus is resuscitation and life-saving measures, not a detailed forensic examination. Subtle or internal injuries can easily be missed in such circumstances.\n4.  **\"If Jane is NOT GUILTY\" premise:** This premise means that Jane did not cause the injuries. However, it does not alter the medical reality of when these types of injuries would have been present if they were genuinely sustained and contributed to Ben's death. If the injuries were caused by another party, or by an accident, they would still have been present when Ben was brought to the hospital. If the injuries were erroneously identified by the autopsy (i.e., they weren't truly injuries), that would contradict the premise that \"injuries... were discovered.\"\n\nGiven that the autopsy discovered these severe, acute injuries directly linked to the cause of death, it is overwhelmingly probable that they were present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital. The scenario where these specific, extensive injuries developed or occurred *after* admission to the hospital but *before* the autopsy (without any indication of further trauma or medical incident in the hospital) is medically highly improbable.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that these injuries were *not* present when Ben was brought to the hospital is extremely low.\n\n1",
