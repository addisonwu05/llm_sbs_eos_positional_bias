Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The description of spinal bleeding's commonality in natural death serves to offer an alternative explanation for the finding, rather than to make its presence highly improbable in a smothering case.\n\n75"

However, this case involves two children dying in similar, suspicious circumstances. The \"not guilty\" scenario relies on both children dying of SIDS or natural causes. The text mentions \"The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK.\" The probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is exceedingly rare (often estimated as 1 in many millions, even accounting for potential shared risk factors). This makes the prior probability of innocence (P(NG)) very low for such a scenario.\n\nGiven Jane is charged, and the highly unusual circumstances of two infant deaths, it's reasonable to assume that the overall evidence (even before the specific forensic details) creates a significant initial suspicion of guilt. A neutral prior of 50% for guilt (P(G)=0.5, P(NG)=0.5) is a common starting point in Bayesian analysis when specific base rates are difficult to apply to the precise scenario.\n\n**Calculate Posterior Probability:**\nPrior Odds = P(G) / P(NG) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1\n\nPosterior Odds = Prior Odds * Product LR = 1 * 46.54 = 46.54\n\nPosterior Probability P(G|E) = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)\nP(G|E) = 46.54 / (1 + 46.54) = 46.54 / 47.54 ≈ 0.9789\n\nThis calculation indicates a very high probability of guilt based on the combined weight of the evidence.\n\n98"
