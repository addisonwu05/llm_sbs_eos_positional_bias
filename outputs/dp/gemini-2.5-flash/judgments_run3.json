  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Andy's death was due to natural causes (such as SIDS). In such a scenario, Andy would have been found unconscious, and resuscitation attempts would have been made by Jane, paramedics, and hospital staff. The provided text explicitly states: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Given that resuscitation efforts are known to cause injuries, especially in fragile infants, and such attempts definitely occurred in Andy's case, the presence of injuries consistent with these attempts is highly probable.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she murdered Andy by smothering him. Following the act of smothering, Andy would have been found unconscious, leading to emergency services being called and subsequent resuscitation attempts by paramedics and hospital staff. The text explicitly states that Andy's injuries (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and are \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n\nTherefore, even if Jane is guilty, the fact that resuscitation attempts would have occurred makes these injuries highly probable. Furthermore, the re-evaluation of Andy's autopsy photographs and the subsequent murder charge implies that these injuries are also considered potential indicators or direct consequences of the smothering itself. If the act of smothering contributed to these injuries (e.g., through struggle or direct trauma), in addition to the injuries caused by resuscitation efforts, the overall likelihood of finding these specific injuries becomes even higher than in a scenario where only resuscitation is the cause.\n\nGiven that these injuries are consistent with resuscitation (which would definitely occur if Jane were guilty) AND potentially indicative of the smothering itself (as suggested by the re-evaluation leading to murder charges), the likelihood of finding these injuries if Jane is guilty is very high.\n\n95",

  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben died by smothering. Following this, Ben would have been found unconscious, and resuscitation attempts would have been made by Jane, paramedics, and hospital staff.\n\nLet's analyze the likelihood of each injury in this scenario:\n\n1.  **Dislocated ribs:** The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben died and resuscitation attempts *definitely* occurred (\"Ben could not be resuscitated\"). Post-mortem changes also *definitely* occurred. Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs is highly probable in this scenario.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The text states this \"is a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was *not* natural; it was caused by smothering. This implies that while spinal bleeding is common in natural death, its presence is *less likely* if the death is unnatural (e.g., due to smothering) than if it were natural. However, \"common\" does not mean exclusive, and severe hypoxia (from smothering) or vigorous resuscitation efforts could still potentially lead to spinal bleeding or contribute to it. Furthermore, the fact that \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\" were among the findings that led to the murder charge suggests these injuries are considered by the prosecution to be consistent with, or at least not contradictory to, death by smothering.\n\nConsidering both injuries:\n*   The dislocated ribs are highly probable due to the certain occurrence of resuscitation attempts.\n*   The spinal bleeding is less probable than in a natural death, but not impossible, as severe hypoxia or resuscitation trauma could contribute.\n\nGiven that these findings (including \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord\") led to the murder charge, they are presented as being consistent with Jane's guilt. Therefore, the likelihood of finding them if Jane is guilty should be moderate to high, but lower than if the death was natural (as in the \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario, where spinal bleeding is explicitly \"common\").\n\nTaking these factors into account, the overall likelihood is reduced from the \"NOT GUILTY\" scenario (which was 90), but remains plausible.\n\n65",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, Ben's death was natural (e.g., SIDS). In this scenario, Ben would have been found unwell, and subsequent to being brought to the hospital, extensive resuscitation attempts would have been made by paramedics and hospital staff. The text states:\n\n*   \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death...\" This suggests it could be present upon arrival.\n*   \"...and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts and post-mortem changes would occur *after* Ben was brought to the hospital. Therefore, if the dislocated ribs were caused by these events, they would *not* have been present when Ben was first brought in.\n*   The \"hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain\" is a consequence of the dying process. While the *process* of hypoxia would have begun, the *damage* itself is an internal finding typically confirmed at autopsy, not something nurses would visually note as an injury on arrival.\n*   \"Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\" could be present on arrival due to natural causes, but depending on their subtlety and the emergency situation, nurses might not note them during initial assessment.\n\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" This implies that either the injuries were not physically present yet, or they were not externally visible/obvious enough to be documented by nurses during the chaotic resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven that the dislocated ribs are explicitly stated to \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\" (events happening *after* being brought to the hospital), it is highly likely that these specific injuries were *not* present when Ben was initially brought in. Other internal injuries like spinal bleeding and hypoxic damage would also not typically be noted externally by nurses, even if they were present.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that these injuries (or at least the significant ones like dislocated ribs, and the non-visible nature of others) were not present or not discernable by nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital is very high.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means Ben died by smothering. Following this, Ben would have been found unresponsive, leading to emergency resuscitation attempts by paramedics and hospital staff.\n\nLet's analyze the likelihood of the found injuries (or lack thereof) being noted by nurses upon Ben's arrival:\n\n*   **Dislocated ribs:** The text states these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, resuscitation attempts definitely occurred after Ben was brought to the hospital. Therefore, it is highly likely these ribs were *not present* when Ben was initially brought in.\n*   **Spinal bleeding:** This is an internal injury. Regardless of whether it was caused by smothering, resuscitation, or was a pre-existing condition, it would not be externally visible or palpable for nurses to \"note\" upon arrival.\n*   **Hypoxic damage to the brain:** This is also an internal, microscopic finding from oxygen deprivation. It would not be externally visible or noted by nurses upon arrival.\n*   **Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These can be caused by asphyxia (smothering). While they *could* be present upon arrival, they can be subtle, or develop/worsen during resuscitation. Given the chaotic nature of an emergency resuscitation, and the focus on vital signs, subtle hemorrhages might easily be overlooked by nurses. Furthermore, the case background states \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae,\" which implies a lack of obvious external signs of smothering.\n\nConsidering all these points, even if Jane is guilty, it is highly probable that the injuries found on Ben were either not physically present yet (like the dislocated ribs), or were internal and not externally discernible (spinal bleeding, hypoxic damage), or were subtle enough to be overlooked by nurses during initial assessment (eye/eyelid haemorrhages). Therefore, the fact that these injuries were \"not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\" is very likely.\n\n90",
