Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me consider what this means for the absence of petechiae:\n\nPetechiae are small hemorrhagic spots that can occur during smothering due to increased pressure and compromised circulation. However, they are not always present even in confirmed smothering cases - they appear in only a subset of smothering deaths.\n\nIf Ben died from natural causes (SIDS):\n- Petechiae would typically not be expected as a primary feature\n- SIDS deaths generally don't involve the mechanical trauma and pressure changes that cause petechiae\n- The absence of petechiae would be consistent with a natural death\n\nIf Ben died from smothering:\n- Petechiae might be present, but are not always present\n- Their absence doesn't rule out smothering, but their presence would be more indicative of it\n\nGiven that we're assuming Jane is not guilty (meaning natural death/SIDS), the absence of petechiae would be quite consistent with this scenario. Natural infant deaths typically would not produce these types of hemorrhagic spots.\n\nThe absence of petechiae, while not definitive evidence either way, is more consistent with natural death than with smothering.\n\n85"

Research on infanticide by smothering shows:\n\n- Petechiae occur in smothering deaths but are not always present\n- The absence of petechiae does not rule out smothering\n- Factors affecting petechiae formation include duration of asphyxia, method used, and individual physiological responses\n- In infant smothering cases, petechiae may be less frequently observed than in adult asphyxiation cases\n- Other injuries were found in Ben (rib injuries, spinal cord damage, brain hypoxia, eye hemorrhages) that are consistent with violent assault\n\nThe presence of other significant injuries (rib fractures, spinal cord injuries, brain hypoxia, eye hemorrhages) suggests severe trauma occurred. The absence of petechiae in this context, while somewhat unexpected, is still plausible in a smothering case.\n\nGiven that smothering can occur without petechiae formation, especially in infants, and considering the other injuries present, the absence of petechiae would be moderately likely even if Jane is guilty.\n\n40"
