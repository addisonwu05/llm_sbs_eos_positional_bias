  "Given the initial diagnosis of the injuries being due to resuscitation attempts, it is possible that the injuries found in Andy were not caused by smothering. However, without more conclusive evidence, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of the injuries being found in Andy if Jane is not guilty.\n\nProbability Judgment: 50",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it is highly likely that the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were the result of deliberate harm inflicted by Jane.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Given the absence of typical injuries of smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben, if Jane is not guilty, it is possible that the injuries found on Ben were not caused by smothering.\n\nProbability Judgment: 60",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is less likely for there to be an absence of typical injuries of smothering, such as petechiae. The lack of petechiae in Ben may suggest alternative causes of death in this scenario.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is more likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, especially if they were not initially noted by the nurses. This could suggest that the injuries occurred after Ben was already in the hospital.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. In this case, it would be more probable that the injuries were inflicted before or during the time he was in Jane's care.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is more likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were not indicative of foul play. The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death and the dislocated ribs possibly occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts could support the innocence of Jane in this case.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is less likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were solely due to natural causes or post-mortem occurrences. These findings may suggest physical trauma inflicted by Jane.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is less likely for there to be such striking similarities between both incidents. These consistencies in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of both babies could raise suspicions, but without Jane being guilty, the occurrence of these similarities is less likely.\n\nProbability Judgment: 50",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it is more likely for there to be such similarities between both incidents. These consistent patterns in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Andy and Ben could indicate a deliberate and premeditated action on Jane's part.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely for the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung to have been present in Andy. These findings are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, and without Jane being guilty of such actions, the likelihood of these specific injuries decreases significantly.\n\nProbability Judgment: 10",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being present in Andy is very high. These injuries are highly indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering in cases where foul play is involved.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. In the absence of foul play by Jane, other explanations for the timing of the brain damage would need to be considered.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. In cases of smothering where oxygen is restricted, this type of brain damage would be consistent with the actions of the perpetrator.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were present. These specific injuries are highly indicative of violent trauma, and without Jane's involvement in causing harm to Ben, the likelihood of these findings occurring decreases significantly.\n\nProbability Judgment: 10",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is very likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by her actions. These injuries are consistent with the consequences of violent trauma, such as smothering.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the specific injuries found on both children, the similarities in the circumstances surrounding their deaths, the patterns of abuse consistent with smothering, and the medical assessments indicating foul play, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty appears to be:\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
  "Guilty"
