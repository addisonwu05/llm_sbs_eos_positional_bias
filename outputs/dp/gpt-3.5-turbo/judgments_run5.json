  "It is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts without further evidence or expert testimony. However, if Jane is not guilty and the injuries were indeed caused by resuscitation attempts, it is possible that the likelihood of this explanation could be fairly high, potentially around 70-80%. \n\n### 80 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being intentional and caused by smothering rather than resuscitation attempts would be higher. In this case, the probability of the injuries being consistent with smothering could be around 90-95%.\n\n### 95 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being consistent with natural causes or occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts could be fairly high. In this scenario, the probability of these findings being unrelated to foul play might be around 70-80%.\n\n### 75 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being related to intentional harm or smothering would be higher. In this case, the probability of these findings being consistent with foul play could be around 90-95%.\n\n### 92 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be moderate. In such a scenario, the probability of these injuries not being noted by nurses initially might be around 50-60%.\n\n### 55 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital could be lower. In this case, the probability of these injuries not being noted by nurses initially due to intentional actions or foul play could be around 40-50%.\n\n### 45 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries of a death due to smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben could suggest other causes of death. In this case, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae might be moderately high, around 70-80%.\n\n### 75 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries such as petechiae in Ben despite the presence of other injuries could be unusual. In this scenario, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae might be lower, around 40-50%.\n\n### 45 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be low. In this situation, the probability of these findings being unrelated to foul play might be around 20-30%.\n\n### 25 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be much higher. In this case, the probability of these findings being related to foul play could be around 90-95%.\n\n### 92 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these striking similarities between both incidents could be coincidental or due to other factors. In this scenario, the probability of these similarities occurring by chance might be around 30-40%.\n\n### 35 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents being intentional and related to her actions could be significantly higher. In this case, the probability of these similarities being due to foul play might be around 80-90%.\n\n### 85 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death could be related to factors other than Jane's actions. In this case, the probability of this damage not being caused by Jane shortly before death might be around 50-60%.\n\n### 55 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death due to intentional harm or neglect could be higher. In this case, the probability of this damage being caused by Jane shortly before death might be around 70-80%.\n\n### 75 ###",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present could be due to reasons other than smothering or violent trauma. In this case, the probability of these findings not being related to foul play might be around 40-50%.\n\n### 45 ###",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present due to smothering or violent trauma could be significantly higher.

  "Based on the evidence provided, considering the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, and the potential indications of foul play, the probability that the defendant is guilty could be reasonably high.\n\n### 80 ###",
