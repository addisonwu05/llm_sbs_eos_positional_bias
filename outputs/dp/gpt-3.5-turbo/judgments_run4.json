  "Without further information or evidence suggesting otherwise, it is difficult to accurately determine the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to the resuscitation attempts. However, given that such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, there may be a possibility that they are indeed a result of the resuscitation efforts and not indicative of foul play. \n\nBased on this limited information, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts is estimated to be around 60.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being intentional and not solely due to resuscitation attempts would be higher. Given the specific injuries discovered, including bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, there is a higher probability that these injuries were caused by smothering rather than just resuscitation efforts. \n\nIn this scenario, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being due to intentional harm by Jane is estimated to be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of specific injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae, on Ben may suggest that foul play was not involved in his death. This could indicate that the injuries found on Ben were not consistent with smothering and may have another explanation.\n\nIn this case, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae on Ben suggesting Jane's innocence is estimated to be around 70.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben despite the presence of other injuries consistent with smothering may be due to various factors. It is possible that the smothering technique used by Jane did not result in the typical signs of petechiae, or that the examination missed these particular injuries. \n\nIn this scenario, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben being a factor in establishing guilt is estimated to be around 40.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it would be crucial to consider the possibility that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the injuries were not noted by the nurses upon his arrival raises questions about the timing and origin of these injuries. \n\nIn this case, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be around 60.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the scenario in which the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital aligns with a potential pattern of concealment or delayed discovery of the injuries. The fact that these injuries were not noted by the nurses upon Ben's arrival at the hospital despite their severity raises suspicions of intentional harm.\n\nIn this situation, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is important to consider the possibility that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben could have occurred due to natural causes or post-mortem changes. The presence of spinal bleeding in cases of natural death and the potential for ribs to become dislocated during resuscitation attempts are factors that must be taken into account when evaluating the evidence.\n\nIn this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is estimated to be around 50.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben may indicate a pattern of intentional harm and possibly violent actions towards the child. While these findings could potentially be attributed to other causes, in the context of Jane being guilty of smothering her children, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben as a result of her actions is higher.\n\nIn this scenario, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben is estimated to be around 70.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the remarkable similarities between both incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben may be attributed to mere coincidences or shared circumstances that are not indicative of foul play. Factors such as the ages of the babies, the timing of their deaths, and Jane being alone with them at the time of the incidents could potentially align due to natural occurrences or routine procedures.\n\nIn this context, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents being coincidental is estimated to be around 40.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of significant similarities between both incidents involving the deaths of Andy and Ben raises concerns about a potential pattern of deliberate actions on Jane's part. The consistent factors such as the age of the babies, the timing of their deaths shortly after feeding, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious may indicate a calculated approach to the alleged crimes.\n\nIn the scenario where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents indicating intentional actions on her part is estimated to be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung upon re-examination of Andy's death could potentially be attributed to factors other than abuse or smothering. These injuries may have alternative explanations or could have been overlooked during the initial investigation, leading to a reassessment that suggests a different cause of death.\n\nIn the scenario where Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy not being indicative of abuse or smothering is estimated to be around 30.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy upon re-examination of his death would align with the pattern of abuse and smothering. These specific injuries are often considered indicative of intentional harm, especially in cases of smothering where physical signs of struggle and trauma are present.\n\nIn the context where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy indicating abuse and smothering is estimated to be around 90.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids would need to be explained by factors other than smothering or violent trauma. These specific injuries are commonly associated with asphyxiation or physical harm and would require alternative explanations if they were to exist in the absence of guilt on Jane's part.\n\nIn the scenario where Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids having causes other than smothering or violent trauma is estimated to be around 20.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids would align with the pattern of deliberate harm and potential smothering or violent trauma inflicted by her. These specific injuries are commonly associated with actions such as asphyxiation, which may have resulted from intentional suffocation or other abusive acts.\n\nIn the context where Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being the result of smothering or violent trauma is estimated to be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death would be subject to scrutiny. Alternative explanations or potential medical conditions that could account for such damage within the specified timeframe would need to be considered if Jane is not responsible for the actions leading to Ben's death.\n\nIn the scenario where Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be around 40.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death would likely strengthen the case against her. This timing aligns with the notion that intentional harm, such as smothering or deliberate asphyxiation, could have led to the hypoxic damage observed in Ben's brain shortly before his passing.\n\nIn the context where Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be around 70.\n\n100",
  "Given the detailed evidence presented, the patterns of injuries, circumstances surrounding both incidents, and the consistency with smothering and deliberate harm, the probability that the defendant Jane is guilty based on the information provided is estimated to be around 85.\n\n100",
