  "Since the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it is unlikely that the injuries were not present when he was brought in. \n\n**Probability Judgment: 15**",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as they were indicative of deliberate harm rather than a natural cause.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 5**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben could indicate that smothering was not the cause of death, as these are often characteristic signs of asphyxiation.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 20**",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben might still be possible depending on the specific circumstances of the smothering, as not all cases of smothering exhibit petechiae.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 40**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy could indeed be consistent with resuscitation attempts and may not necessarily indicate foul play.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 30**",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy are more likely to be associated with smothering rather than resuscitation attempts.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 70**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is possible that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben could be attributed to natural causes or post-mortem changes.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 25**",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben is more likely to be connected to intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than natural causes or post-mortem changes.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 75**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, as this would suggest a sudden onset of an event leading to such damage.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 10**",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is more probable that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death as a result of deliberate actions leading to his demise.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 80**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these striking similarities between both incidents, considering the circumstances mentioned, may be relatively low.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 20**",
  "If Jane is guilty, there is a higher probability that these similarities between both incidents, such as the age of the babies, the timing of their deaths, and being alone with Jane when they were found unconscious, are more than just coincidental and are linked to intentional harm.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 80**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present without the involvement of smothering or violent trauma is relatively low.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 15**",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be more likely to be associated with smothering or violent trauma.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 90**",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death not being indicative of abuse or characteristic of smothering could be relatively low.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 20**",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering would be high.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 90**",
  "Given the evidence presented, including the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, and the patterns that suggest intentional harm, the probability of the defendant being guilty appears to be significant.\n\n**Probability Judgment: 80**",
  "Guilty"
