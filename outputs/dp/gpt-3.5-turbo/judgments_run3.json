  "It is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, considering the severity and nature of the injuries. The fact that nurses did not note them upon arrival also raises concerns about their visibility or detectability. Therefore, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital is estimated to be around 15. \n\n***15***",
  "If Jane is guilty, given the nature and severity of the injuries found on Ben, it is highly unlikely that these injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that nurses did not note them upon arrival also raises suspicions that someone may have intentionally concealed or caused these injuries. Therefore, the probability that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, if Jane is guilty, is estimated to be around 5.\n\n***5***",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries found on Andy were initially explained as being caused by resuscitation attempts, it is quite likely that these injuries were indeed a result of the attempts to revive him. In cases of resuscitation, especially for babies, such injuries are not uncommon due to the delicate nature of their bodies. Therefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were a result of resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, is estimated to be around 80.\n\n***80***",
  "If Jane is guilty and considering the new evidence that suggests injuries on Andy consistent with smothering, it is highly unlikely that these injuries were solely due to resuscitation attempts. The presence of bruises, torn frenulum, and other signs of trauma on Andy's body indicate something more sinister may have occurred. Hence, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were not solely from resuscitation attempts, if Jane is guilty, is around 90.\n\n***90***",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the information provided that spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are common findings in natural death or can occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, it is plausible that these findings in Ben could indeed be attributed to natural causes or medical interventions rather than foul play. Hence, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is around 70.\n\n***70***",
  "If Jane is guilty, considering the new evidence of injuries consistent with smothering found in Ben and the severity of these injuries, it is highly unlikely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were solely due to natural causes or post-mortem occurrences. The presence of such injuries in conjunction with other signs of trauma suggests a more sinister explanation related to foul play. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is estimated to be around 95.\n\n***95***",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the absence of typical injuries like petechiae (which can indicate suffocation or smothering) on Ben despite the other injuries found, it raises questions about the cause of his death and the presence of other signs consistent with smothering. In the absence of such tell-tale signs, the likelihood of the injuries being solely related to smothering decreases. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be around 50.\n\n***50***",
  "If Jane is guilty and the injuries found on Ben are indeed a result of smothering, the absence of typical injuries like petechiae, which can be indicative of suffocation or smothering, raises some doubt. It is unusual for such injuries to be absent in cases of smothering. Given this discrepancy, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be around 30.\n\n***30***",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids that are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, one would expect such injuries to be present in cases where foul play is involved. In the absence of guilt, it would be unusual for these specific injuries to be present without a sinister cause. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is approximately 90.\n\n***90***",
  "If Jane is guilty and considering the presence of injuries such as hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids that are consistent with smothering or violent trauma, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring as a result of her actions increases significantly. It is probable that such injuries would be associated with intentional harm in the case of guilt. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is estimated to be around 95.\n\n***95***",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the astonishing similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being about the same age when they died, passing away at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would appear to be more coincidental or circumstantial rather than evidence of intentional harm. In the absence of guilt, the likelihood of these similarities occurring between both incidents is approximately 35.\n\n***35***",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of astonishing similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being around the same age when they died, passing away at a similar time of day after feeding, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would strongly suggest a pattern of intentional harm or consistent modus operandi. These similarities would be indicative of a deliberate and calculated approach. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities between both incidents is estimated to be around 90.\n\n***90***",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the alleged timeframe provided by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have occurred a matter of hours before death, it would be suggestive of a sudden or acute event rather than a prolonged or deliberate act of harm. In the absence of guilt, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be around 70.\n\n***70***",
  "If Jane is guilty, and considering the alleged timeframe provided by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have occurred a matter of hours before death, it is highly probable that this damage was a result of deliberate and intentional actions leading up to his demise. The notion of the damage occurring within hours before death aligns with the concept of harm being inflicted close to the time of death. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be around 95.\n\n***95***",
  "If Jane is not guilty and considering the findings of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung during the re-examination of Andy's death, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it would be unusual for these specific signs of trauma to be present in the absence of foul play. In the context of innocence, the presence of these injuries points towards a more concerning underlying cause. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is around 80.\n\n***80***",
  "If Jane is guilty, and considering the significant findings of bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung during the re-examination of Andy's death, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it is highly likely that these injuries were a result of intentional harm inflicted by Jane. These specific signs of trauma strongly suggest foul play, specifically smothering, as the cause of Andy's death. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is estimated to be around 95.\n\n***95***",
  "Based on the given evidence, including the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, the alleged findings related to smothering, and the patterns observed, the probability that the defendant is guilty appears to be quite high.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant is guilty is estimated to be around 90.\n\n***90***",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence and probabilities assessed, the verdict for the defendant is:\n\n**Guilty**"
