  "It is difficult to provide a precise probability judgment without more information on the specific circumstances of Ben's injuries and the timeline of events. However, based on the fact that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital and the possibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) being a potential explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben, it is reasonable to consider that there is a moderate likelihood (around 40-50%) that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty.\n\nProbability judgment: 45",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. Given the autopsy findings of injuries to the ribs, spinal cord, brain, and eyes, it is reasonable to believe that these injuries were likely present prior to Ben being brought to the hospital.\n\nProbability judgment: 5",
  "Considering the information that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, there is a moderate likelihood (around 30-40%) that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben.\n\nProbability judgment: 35",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben would likely be more indicative of abuse or physical trauma rather than natural causes or post-mortem occurrences.\n\nProbability judgment: 85",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which are common and can result in injuries consistent with such efforts, especially in the case of a baby.\n\nProbability judgment: 60",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the injuries found in Andy might not solely be attributed to resuscitation attempts, and there may be a higher likelihood that these injuries were intentionally caused.\n\nProbability judgment: 75",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of injuries, such as petechiae, commonly associated with deaths due to smothering in Ben suggests that the cause of death may not have been related to smothering.\n\nProbability judgment: 70",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben could either suggest a different method of smothering employed by Jane or could raise some doubts about the evidence linking her to the crime.\n\nProbability judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death might be indicative of a medical condition or other factors not related to intentional harm or smothering.\n\nProbability judgment: 25",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy would strongly support the evidence of abuse and smothering.\n\nProbability judgment: 85",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and considering the possibility of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or natural causes in Ben's case, it is unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. Other factors could have contributed to this damage.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, given the circumstances surrounding the act of smothering and the effects it can have on oxygen levels.\n\nProbability judgment: 95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids found could potentially have been caused by factors other than smothering or violent trauma, such as underlying health conditions or accidental occurrences.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would strongly suggest that these injuries were indeed caused by the act of smothering or violent trauma.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the occurrence of these striking similarities between both incidents, including the age of the babies, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane finding them unconscious when alone, would likely be coincidental or have alternative explanations unrelated to any criminal activity by Jane.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the presence of these striking similarities between both incidents, such as the age of the babies, the timing of their deaths after feeding, and Jane finding them unconscious when alone, would strongly indicate a pattern of deliberate actions on Jane's part.\n\nProbability judgment: 85",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the autopsy findings, injuries to both children, patterns of similarities in the incidents, and the lack of natural explanations for the injuries, it seems that the probability that the defendant is guilty is high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "Guilty"
