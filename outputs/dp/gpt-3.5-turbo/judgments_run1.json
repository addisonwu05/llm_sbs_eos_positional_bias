  "Given that initial assessments attributed Andy's injuries to resuscitation attempts, there is a likelihood that these injuries could have been a result of those efforts. Considering this, and the lack of a conclusive cause of death, the probability that Jane is not guilty of the murder of her children based solely on the injuries found in Andy may be 70. \n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the injuries found in Andy could be more likely attributed to smothering rather than resuscitation attempts. Given the pattern of injuries found in both children and the suspicions raised, the probability that Jane is guilty of the murder of her children based on the injuries found in Andy might be 90.\n\n100",
  "Considering the absence of typical indicators of smothering, like petechiae, in Ben despite the severe injuries found, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of such injuries could be around 60.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of her children through smothering, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben could be less likely explained, possibly due to the specific circumstances surrounding the acts. In this scenario, the probability of the absence of petechiae in Ben if Jane is guilty might be around 30.\n\n100",
  "Given that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and dislocated ribs could potentially occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that these findings in Ben were not related to criminal actions might be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of her children through smothering, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben could be more suggestive of foul play. In this context, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these findings being related to her actions might be around 70.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as noted by the nurses, could be around 50.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital and were possibly inflicted by Jane could be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring due to reasons other than smothering or violent trauma could be around 20.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by her actions could be around 90.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being present in Andy and indicative of abuse or smothering could be around 30.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being signs of abuse and indicative of smothering could be around 90.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these striking similarities between both incidents occurring by mere coincidence could be around 10.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these remarkable similarities between both incidents not being coincidental but rather indicative of a pattern of intentional harm could be around 80.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was not caused a matter of hours before death could be around 40.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death due to intentional harm could be around 80.\n\n100",
  "Based on the evidence provided, including the nature and pattern of injuries found in both children, the similarities between the incidents, and the suspicions raised, the probability that the defendant is guilty could be around 90.\n\n100",
