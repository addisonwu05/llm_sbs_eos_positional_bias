  "Given the information provided, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly unlikely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were related to foul play. Therefore, the likelihood of these findings being present in a natural death scenario would be approximately **5%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben would likely be indicative of foul play such as smothering or physical abuse. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these findings being present due to her actions would be approximately **90%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the injuries found in Andy, including bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, could indeed be consistent with resuscitation attempts to revive a baby. In such cases, the injuries may be accidental in nature. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being linked to resuscitation attempts would be approximately **80%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the injuries found in Andy, including bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, may be more indicative of intentional harm or abuse rather than solely accidental injuries from resuscitation attempts. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these injuries being related to her actions would be approximately **95%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite the other injuries found, could suggest that smothering was not the cause of death. In cases of smothering, petechiae are often seen due to the lack of oxygen and pressure applied during the act. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben would be approximately **70%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite the presence of other injuries, may suggest a different mechanism of harm or concealment of evidence. In cases where smothering or suffocation occurs, the presence of petechiae is more common due to the physiological response to oxygen deprivation. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben would be approximately **80%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and considering that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it suggests that these injuries may have occurred after Ben was initially brought in for medical help. In cases where injuries are not observed or documented upon arrival but later become apparent, it could indicate a different timeline or cause for those injuries. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital would be approximately **60%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and considering that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, it could indicate a deliberate attempt to conceal or delay the discovery of those injuries. In cases of foul play, perpetrators may try to hide signs of abuse or harm until they are brought to light during medical examination. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital would be approximately **85%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and considering the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, it suggests that there could have been a sudden, acute event leading to this damage rather than a prolonged period of oxygen deprivation. In cases where hypoxic damage is linked to a more immediate cause, the timeline becomes crucial in determining the circumstances surrounding the injury. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death would be approximately **75%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and considering the doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, it could suggest a deliberate act leading to oxygen deprivation, such as smothering or suffocation. In cases where intentional harm is inflicted, the timing of the hypoxic damage becomes a key factor in establishing the cause of death and the culpability of the individual responsible. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death would be approximately **90%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and considering that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it suggests that these findings may have an alternative explanation or cause that is not related to intentional harm. In cases where injuries are initially attributed to abuse but later determined to have different origins, it could point to a different narrative surrounding the circumstances of the death. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being present for reasons other than abuse and smothering would be approximately **40%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and considering that the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, it suggests a strong link between Jane's actions and the injuries observed. In cases where these specific injuries align with abusive behavior, the likelihood of intentional harm or smothering leading to these findings would be significant. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being a result of abuse and smothering would be approximately **95%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the similarities between both incidents, including the babies being about the same age when they died, passing away at a similar time of the day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could be attributed to unfortunate coincidences or common patterns in infant deaths. In cases where no foul play is involved, these similarities could be explained by factors such as routine feeding schedules, infant vulnerability, and environmental circumstances. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents occurring due to reasons other than deliberate actions would be approximately **60%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being about the same age when they died, passing away at a similar time of the day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could suggest a pattern of intentional harm or neglect. In cases where these similarities align with a deliberate course of action, the likelihood of these incidents sharing common characteristics due to Jane's actions would be indicative of a higher degree of intentionality. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents being a result of intentional actions would be approximately **85%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and considering that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, it raises the possibility of alternative explanations or underlying medical conditions that could account for these findings. In cases where no foul play is involved, these specific injuries may have origins unrelated to intentional harm, potentially pointing towards a different cause of death or contributing factors. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present for reasons other than smothering or violent trauma would be approximately **50%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and considering that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, it indicates a higher probability of intentional harm or abuse leading to these specific injuries. In cases where these injuries align with clinical findings typical of smothering or violent trauma, the likelihood of these injuries being the result of deliberate actions would be significant. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being linked to smothering or violent trauma would be approximately **90%**.\nBased on the given information, this probability judgment is made.\n\n100",
