  "Let's analyze the probabilities carefully:\n\n1. Age similarity:\n- Both children died around 8-11 weeks old\n- This is a very specific and narrow age range, not typical across all infant deaths\n\n2. Time of day similarity:\n- Both died shortly after being fed\n- This suggests a specific pattern rather than random occurrence\n\n3. Circumstantial similarities:\n- Jane was alone in both incidents\n- She discovered the babies unconscious\n- Both incidents occurred within the family's immediate living environment\n\n4. Statistical context:\n- SIDS frequency is 1 in 4,000\n- Probability of SIDS occurring twice in same family is extremely low\n- Statistically, multiple infant deaths in same family are rare\n\n5. Medical evidence:\n- Second child (Ben) showed clear signs of potential trauma\n- Retrospective examination of first child (Andy) revealed previously undetected injuries\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that these strikingly similar incidents could occur naturally (by chance) without deliberate intervention is very low.\n\nThe cumulative likelihood of such precise matching circumstances occurring independently appears to be extremely improbable.\n\n***50***",
  "If Jane is guilty of intentionally causing both children's deaths, the similarities would be highly consistent with deliberate, repeated behavior:\n\n1.
