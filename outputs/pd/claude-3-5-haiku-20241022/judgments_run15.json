  "To assess the probability of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty, I'll break down the key coincidences:\n\n1. Age at death:\n- Andy: 11 weeks old\n- Ben: 8 weeks old\n(Very close in age, unusual but not impossible)\n\n2. Time of day:\n- Both died after being fed and put to bed\n- Both found unconscious when Jane was alone\n(Highly specific and unusual combination)\n\n3. Cause of death:\n- First child: Initial finding of natural causes\n- Second child: Clear evidence of potential trauma\n(Statistically extremely rare)\n\nAdditional context considerations:\n- SIDS frequency is 1 in 4,000\n- Two SIDS deaths in one family is extraordinarily rare\n- Repeated infant deaths under nearly identical circumstances\n- Presence of physical injuries in second child\n\nStatistical experts have studied repeated infant deaths and found that while rare, they can occur naturally. However, the specific similarities here make pure coincidence extremely unlikely.\n\nThe combination of these precise, matching circumstances suggests a very low probability of random occurrence.\n\nProbability judgment (if Jane is NOT GUILTY): 5",
  "If Jane is guilty of intentionally causing both children's deaths, the striking similarities become much more explicable:\n\n1. Age at death:\n- Both very young infants\n- Similar vulnerability\n- Consistent with a repeated method of assault\n\n2. Time of day:\n- Choosing a time when babies are typically sleepy\n- Minimizing potential witnesses\n- Recreating similar circumstances to previous incident\n\n3. Cause of death:\n- Smothering as a consistent method\n- Similar timing and context\n- Learned/repeated approach to hiding criminal act\n\nPsychological factors:\n- Potential underlying psychiatric condition\n- Repeated pattern of behavior\n- Consistent modus operandi in infanticide\n\nForensic considerations:\n- Physical evidence supports intentional harm\n- Repeated nature of incident suggests deliberate action\n- Highly specific circumstances point to planned behavior\n\nThe precise matching of circumstances strongly suggests intentional, repeated action rather than coincidence.\n\nProbability judgment (if Jane is GUILTY): 95",
