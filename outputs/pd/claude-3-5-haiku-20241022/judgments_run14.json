  "To assess the probability of such striking similarities occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty, I'll consider multiple factors:\n\n1. Both children died at very similar ages (around 2 months old)\n2. Both died after being fed and put to bed\n3. Both were discovered unconscious by Jane when she was alone\n4. Both deaths occurred under seemingly identical circumstances\n\nThese coincidences are extremely unlikely to happen naturally. While SIDS does occur, the precise matching of circumstances between two separate incidents is statistically improbable.\n\nKey statistical considerations:\n- SIDS frequency is 1 in 4,000\n- Probability of two independent SIDS deaths in same family is (1/4000)²\n- Additional compounding factors of identical circumstances further reduce this probability\n\nThe extreme specificity of these matching details strongly suggests these are not random occurrences. The chances of such precise replication by pure coincidence are vanishingly small.\n\nWhile absolute certainty is impossible without definitive proof, the overwhelming improbability of these circumstances occurring naturally points to a non-random explanation.\n\nTaking into account the detailed forensic evidence, autopsy findings, and the statistically improbable similarities, the likelihood of these being coincidental deaths is extremely low.\n\nProbability Judgment: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty of intentionally causing both children's deaths, the similarities would be highly likely and consistent with her method and opportunity:\n\n1. Same perpetrator (Jane) using consistent method of smothering/causing oxygen deprivation\n2. Similar age of children when attacked (vulnerable period)\n3. Choosing times when alone with children to commit the act\n4. Replicating similar circumstances to make deaths appear natural\n5. Pattern of behavior suggests premeditation and deliberate strategy\n6. Forensic evidence supports intentional harm (bruises, injuries)\n7. Modus operandi (method of killing) remains consistent across both incidents\n\nThe similarities would be almost an expected outcome if Jane deliberately caused both deaths, as she would likely use a familiar and previously \"successful\" approach.\n\nThe forensic findings, matching circumstances, and Jane being the common factor all strongly suggest intentional, repeated actions if she is guilty.\n\nHer isolation with the children, the precise matching of circumstances, and the forensic evidence all point to a deliberate pattern of behavior rather than coincidence.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these striking similarities occurring would be extremely high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
