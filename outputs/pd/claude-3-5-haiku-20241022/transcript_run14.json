Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both children died at very similar ages (around 2 months old)\n2. Both died after being fed and put to bed\n3. Both were discovered unconscious by Jane when she was alone\n4. Both deaths occurred under seemingly identical circumstances\n\nThese coincidences are extremely unlikely to happen naturally. While SIDS does occur, the precise matching of circumstances between two separate incidents is statistically improbable.\n\nKey statistical considerations:\n- SIDS frequency is 1 in 4,000\n- Probability of two independent SIDS deaths in same family is (1/4000)²\n- Additional compounding factors of identical circumstances further reduce this probability\n\nThe extreme specificity of these matching details strongly suggests these are not random occurrences. The chances of such precise replication by pure coincidence are vanishingly small.\n\nWhile absolute certainty is impossible without definitive proof, the overwhelming improbability of these circumstances occurring naturally points to a non-random explanation.\n\nTaking into account the detailed forensic evidence, autopsy findings, and the statistically improbable similarities, the likelihood of these being coincidental deaths is extremely low.\n\nProbability Judgment: 5"
