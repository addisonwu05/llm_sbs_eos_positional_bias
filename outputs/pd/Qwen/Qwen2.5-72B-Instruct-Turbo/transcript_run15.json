Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

These findings suggest non-accidental trauma, which is not typically associated with SIDS.\n\nGiven the specific and unusual nature of these coincidences, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring naturally is very low.

The specific circumstances—both babies dying at a similar age, around the same time of day, and being found by Jane when she was alone with them—could be consistent with a deliberate act.\n\nIn cases of infanticide, especially if the perpetrator is the same person in both instances, it is not uncommon to see a pattern in the timing and circumstances of the deaths. This can be due to the perpetrator's routine, the baby's routine, or the specific method used to cause the death. For example, smothering, which is a common method in such cases, can be carried out more easily when the baby is asleep or quiet, which often happens after feeding.\n\nThe presence of injuries and other medical findings in both Ben and Andy's cases, such as rib injuries, hypoxic damage, and hemorrhages, further supports the possibility of a deliberate act. These findings are consistent with non-accidental trauma and can be explained by the same method being used in both deaths.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring is relatively high, as they are consistent with a deliberate and repeated pattern of behavior.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"
