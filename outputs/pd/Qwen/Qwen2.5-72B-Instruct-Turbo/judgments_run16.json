  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, my verdict for the defendant is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability (85%) that the defendant, Jane, is responsible for the deaths of her children, Andy and Ben, given the consistent and highly indicative injuries and the unusual pattern of events."
