Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

These injuries are less likely to be explained by natural causes or SIDS.\n\n3. **Injuries to Andy**: The re-examination of Andy's death revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which are also indicative of non-accidental trauma. While some of these injuries could be attributed to resuscitation, the combination and nature of the injuries are more consistent with abuse.\n\n4. **Lack of Petechiae**: The absence of petechiae in Ben, while less common in smothering, does not definitively rule out the possibility of smothering, especially given the other consistent injuries.\n\n5. **Post-Mortem and Resuscitation**: The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben can be explained by both natural causes and resuscitation efforts, but the combination with other injuries still supports the hypothesis of abuse.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall evidence strongly suggests that Jane is guilty of the murders of her children. However, it is important to consider that the legal standard for guilt is \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and the final determination would be made by a court based on all the evidence presented.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is estimated to be **85%**.\n\n85"
