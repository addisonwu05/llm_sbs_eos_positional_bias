  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the injuries, similarities, and circumstances, my verdict for the defendant is:\n\n**Guilty**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the high probability that the injuries and the pattern of events are more consistent with deliberate harm than with natural causes or accidental death."
