Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

These specific injuries are strongly indicative of physical trauma that can result from smothering or other forms of abuse. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n1. **Bruises to the Arms and Legs**: These are often signs of restraint or force being applied to the baby, which can occur during an act of smothering or physical abuse.\n2. **Torn Frenulum**: This injury can result from forceful manipulation of the mouth, which might occur if the baby was struggling or if the perpetrator was attempting to prevent the baby from making noise.\n3. **Blood in the Lung**: This can be a result of asphyxiation, where the baby's airways are obstructed, leading to hypoxia and subsequent bleeding.\n\nGiven the specific and characteristic nature of these injuries, they are highly consistent with the act of smothering and other forms of physical abuse.

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Jane is guilty of the murders of her children, Andy and Ben, can be assessed by considering the following key points:\n\n1. **Specific and Severe Injuries**: The injuries found in both Andy and Ben, including bruises, torn frenulum, hypoxic brain damage, and haemorrhages, are highly indicative of smothering or other forms of violent trauma.\n2. **Consistent Circumstances**: The striking similarities in the circumstances of both deaths, such as the age of the infants, the time of day, and the fact that Jane was alone with them when they were found unconscious, suggest a pattern of behavior.\n3. **Medical Explanations**: While some of the injuries can be explained by natural causes or resuscitation efforts, the specific and severe nature of the injuries, particularly in Ben, is less likely to be explained by natural causes alone.\n4. **Post-Mortem Findings**: The re-examination of Andy's injuries, which revealed bruises and other signs of trauma, further supports the hypothesis that the deaths were not natural.\n5. **Probability of Coincidence**: The likelihood of both infants dying under such similar and suspicious circumstances by natural means is very low.\n\nGiven the cumulative weight of the evidence, the probability that Jane is guilty is estimated to be **85**.\n\n85"
