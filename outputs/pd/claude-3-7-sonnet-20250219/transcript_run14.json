Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Andy was 11 weeks (approximately 2.5 months) and Ben was 8 weeks (approximately 2 months) when they died. While both deaths occurred within this high-risk window, many SIDS cases do occur in this timeframe.\n\nRegarding similar times of day after feeding: SIDS deaths commonly occur during sleep periods, often after feeding when babies are put down. This pattern is well-documented in SIDS literature, as feeding and subsequent sleep are routine daily activities.\n\nRegarding both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them: This could reflect common childcare patterns in the household - if Jane was the primary caregiver who typically cared for the children during certain times of day.\n\nHowever, multiple SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare. While SIDS recurrence in families exists, the estimated risk of a second SIDS death is only about 3-5 times higher than the general population. With a baseline SIDS rate of 1 in 4,000, even with this increased risk, a second SIDS death remains very unlikely.\n\nThe combined probability of two children in the same family dying of natural causes or SIDS with these specific similarities is quite low.\n\n20"
