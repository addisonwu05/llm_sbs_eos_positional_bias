  "Given Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung being present in Andy becomes more complex. It means we must consider explanations other than intentional smothering or abuse. These findings, while suggestive of abuse, could potentially be explained by other factors, although they are less common. Possibilities could include undetected medical conditions, mishandling (accidental injury), or misinterpretation of post-mortem findings. Given SIDS as another explanation, the evidence is less indicative of murder and could be potentially downplayed. However, these findings are still suspicious, but are less likely to be the cause of death in the case of innocence.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung becomes much more likely. These findings are consistent with inflicted trauma related to smothering or other forms of abuse. The likelihood of these specific injuries being present in a case of intentional smothering would be relatively high, although not guaranteed in every case.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two infant deaths are striking and statistically improbable if due to entirely independent, natural causes. While SIDS can occur, the convergence of factors like age, time of day after feeding, and Jane being the sole caregiver present during both events significantly decreases the likelihood of pure chance. There could be an underlying, undiagnosed medical condition affecting both children that manifests around the same age and under similar circumstances, but this is still improbable. It might be suggested that Jane is being unfairly targeted due to the misfortune.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents become far more likely. A perpetrator often repeats patterns of behavior. The similarities in age, timing, and circumstances point to a deliberate act repeated in a similar fashion. The common denominator is Jane's presence and the specific context around feeding and subsequent death.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death becomes a critical point. It suggests a rapid, unforeseen event that led to oxygen deprivation. It is possible that an undiagnosed medical condition, a severe allergic reaction, or some other sudden, naturally occurring event caused the hypoxia. While SIDS is a possibility, the hypoxic damage suggests something more acute and rapid. It would be more likely a sudden medical emergency than simply a peaceful passing. However, with no evidence of direct cause other than natural explanation, the probability is reduced as the allegation is still very specific.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death aligns perfectly with a scenario where she intentionally suffocated Ben. The short timeframe strongly suggests an external cause of oxygen deprivation, consistent with smothering. The hypoxic brain damage occurred shortly before the ambulance was called, fitting a smothering scenario where she acted relatively shortly before raising the alarm.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, typically consistent with smothering or trauma, becomes significantly more challenging to explain. While rare, some medical conditions or unforeseen events might mimic these symptoms, it would be unlikely, but possible. The probability isn't zero because there *could* be an extremely rare medical explanation that wasn't discovered.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids aligns strongly with smothering or other forms of violent trauma. These findings are highly indicative of a deliberate act of suffocation or inflicted injury.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries were genuinely present at the time Ben was brought to the hospital, it becomes problematic that the nurses didn't notice them. It could be because the injuries were subtle or masked by other issues. Or that the focus was on resuscitation, not detailed examination. However, the scenario also suggests that maybe the injuries occurred after death, and during the post-mortem investigation. There are possibilities that make it less likely that she is guilty.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of inflicting the injuries, it becomes more likely that the injuries were present when Ben was brought to the hospital, but perhaps not immediately obvious or noticed during the initial emergency response. Nurses might have been focused on resuscitation efforts, potentially overlooking more subtle signs of trauma. Also, the injuries may have been internal and not immediately visible.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of petechiae alongside the other injuries found on Ben introduces a complicating factor. The lack of petechiae may support the notion of SIDS, where those injuries aren't typical. Or, this could suggest that these injuries occurred during other processes, such as resuscitation attempts, or simply a very rare event.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of petechiae, while potentially mitigating, doesn't entirely negate the possibility of smothering. Smothering doesn't always result in petechiae, and the presence of other indicators like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages can still point to foul play. It just makes it less certain, and is a factor against it.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of Andy's injuries being solely due to resuscitation attempts increases. It's plausible that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were caused by aggressive or improperly administered CPR. Resuscitation on infants is known to cause such injuries sometimes.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the assertion that Andy's injuries were solely due to resuscitation becomes a convenient explanation to mask her actions. While resuscitation *can* cause injuries, a guilty Jane might have inflicted the injuries beforehand, knowing that resuscitation could later be blamed. Resuscitation could have exacerbated the original injuries, making it more likely they were discovered, although originally caused by her.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the finding of spinal bleeding as a common occurrence in natural death, and the dislocated ribs likely being post-mortem or due to resuscitation, weakens the case against her. It would be likely for such findings to occur.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the spinal bleeding being common in natural death and dislocated ribs possibly resulting from post-mortem events or resuscitation attempts become confounding factors that complicate the interpretation of the evidence. They don't necessarily exonerate her, but they provide alternative explanations for these specific findings. These findings were still caused naturally, and they were still present.\n\n65\n",
  "Considering all the evidence, the similarities between the deaths, the injuries to both children, the lack of a clear alternative explanation, and the allegation of hypoxic damage happening shortly before death, it seems more likely than not that Jane is guilty. However, there are alternative explanations that would point to her innocence.\n\n70\n",
  "Based solely on the provided information and the derived probability, my verdict is:\n\nGuilty\n"
