  "Given that Jane is *not guilty* and the injuries to Ben are still present, we need to consider the likelihood of those injuries occurring through other means besides her direct actions. SIDS is mentioned, but it's described as \"sudden and unexplainable death\" and doesn't directly *cause* the specific injuries described. The injuries are more consistent with *violent trauma* or *smothering*. If Jane is not guilty, then some other factor *must* have caused these injuries.\n\nIt's difficult to assign a precise probability without knowing what those factors might be. It depends entirely on the likelihood of another, unknown, cause for the injuries. Since the prompt describes the injuries as consistent with smothering or violent trauma, the chance that they are present *without* smothering or trauma (caused by Jane or another person) would be low, given the available information.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, then the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be highly likely. The injuries are described as *consistent* with smothering and/or other violent trauma. Therefore, if smothering or violent trauma *did* occur (caused by Jane), we'd expect these injuries to be present.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty* and the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death, it implies an alternative cause that acted rapidly. Since we don't know what that alternative cause is, we can only estimate based on the information given. It's alleged to have happened hours before death, so the time frame is fixed. However, since Jane is not guilty, it would point to some kind of unknown medical event or accidental event that is not smothering. Given we don't know what this event is, we will assign a probability that it occurred.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben and the doctor alleges the hypoxic damage occurred hours before death, this statement directly supports the prosecution's case. Smothering is a rapid act and if the damage occurred shortly before death, it strongly suggests that smothering was the cause.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, the similarities between the two incidents become highly suspicious. The babies being the same age, dying at similar times after feeding, and Jane being alone with them each time, strongly suggests a common underlying factor beyond mere chance. If Jane didn't cause it, this would be an extraordinary coincidence. While SIDS is mentioned as a possibility, it wouldn't account for Jane being present for both events. The probability of these coincidences happening independently seems low.\n\n5\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents become much more likely. A perpetrator often exhibits patterns in their crimes. The similarities in age, time of day, feeding schedule, and Jane's presence point to a consistent method and opportunity. It doesn't guarantee guilt, but it makes it much more plausible if she *is* guilty.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung on Andy becomes problematic. These findings, described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" strongly suggest that *something* harmful happened to Andy. If Jane is not responsible, it means another cause had to produce these injuries, and that cause would have to mimic abuse/smothering. Since the findings are described as *characteristic* of smothering, it's less likely these injuries would occur without it or another form of abuse.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung becomes highly probable. The statement explicitly states these findings are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" Thus, if smothering occurred, one would expect to find these signs.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, the explanation that Andy's injuries were due to resuscitation attempts gains credibility. The injuries are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, it's more probable that the injuries *were* caused by resuscitation. The injuries themselves are still present, but this statement provides an alternative explanation for them.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of harming Andy (smothering), the injuries *could* be explained away as resuscitation efforts, but this explanation becomes less convincing. While the injuries *are* consistent with resuscitation, it provides a convenient cover for the abuse. It's still possible the injuries were from resuscitation, even if she's guilty, but the likelihood is reduced.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, the absence of petechiae (other typical injuries) in Ben is more consistent with that innocence. If the injuries were caused by something other than smothering (or a different mechanism of smothering that doesn't cause petechiae), it would be expected that some typical signs of smothering are absent. Therefore, their absence would be more likely if she is not guilty.\n\n60\n",
  "If Jane *is guilty* of smothering Ben, the absence of typical injuries like petechiae is somewhat unusual, but not impossible. Smothering can manifest in different ways, and the absence of one particular sign doesn't necessarily negate the possibility of smothering altogether. It's less likely than if she were innocent, but still possible.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is *not guilty*, the fact that spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs could be post-mortem or due to resuscitation, supports her innocence. It suggests an alternative explanation for these specific injuries.\n\n70\n",
  "If Jane *is guilty* of smothering Ben, the finding of spinal bleeding (which is common in natural death) and dislocated ribs (potentially from post-mortem or resuscitation) becomes less incriminating. It allows for a plausible alternative explanation for those specific injuries, even if she *did* contribute to his death through smothering. The injuries, in this case, aren't as strong of an indicator of her guilt, as they could plausibly be explained by other factors.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and the injuries were not noted by nurses at the hospital, then there are two possibilities:\n\n1.  The injuries were *never* present.\n2.  The injuries *were* present but missed.\n\nIt is stated that the injuries were *found*. Therefore, the injuries *were* present, but not noted. This would suggest some kind of error by the nurses. However, there is no indication in the background whether this is likely or not. We will assume they are reasonably competent, but errors are possible.\n\n20\n",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, and the injuries were not noted by the nurses, this suggests that she inflicted the injuries so close to the point of the ambulance being called, that they were not yet obviously visible to the nurses. It is possible that the injuries were subtle at the point that Ben arrived at the hospital.\n\n60\n",
  "The evidence presents a mixed picture. The initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes, but subsequent examination revealed signs of abuse. Ben's autopsy revealed injuries consistent with smothering, and the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage happened shortly before death. The similarities between the two deaths (age, time of day, Jane's presence) are highly suspicious. However, SIDS is a possible explanation, and some injuries could be attributed to resuscitation. Additionally, some typical signs of smothering were absent in Ben, and some findings are consistent with natural death or resuscitation.\n\nWeighing these factors, the evidence leans towards guilt, but there remains a degree of uncertainty. The similarities between the deaths and the evidence of abuse are damaging, but the possibility of alternative explanations cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\n70\n",
  "Based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively determine guilt or innocence. A real-world verdict requires a thorough evaluation of all evidence, witness testimony, and legal arguments, which is beyond my capabilities. However, based on the probabilities I have assigned throughout the previous questions, the evidence appears to lean toward a guilty verdict.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this limited information, my answer would be: **Guilty**\n"
