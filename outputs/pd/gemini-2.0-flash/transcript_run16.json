Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

SIDS is presented as the main alternative explanation.\n\nSIDS, by definition, is unexplained. However, some associated factors could indirectly lead to hypoxic damage. For example, an undiagnosed medical condition causing respiratory distress could lead to hypoxia in the hours leading up to death. The bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung and injuries to the ribs and spinal cord are the major issue, as they point to a violent act, rather than a disease.\n\nIf Jane is innocent, we need to consider that the doctor's assessment of the timing of the hypoxic damage might be incorrect, or that the hypoxic damage was caused by other means. The injuries on the autopsy report are major evidence of a violent act.\n\nGiven the autopsy findings (injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids), it is unlikely the hypoxic damage was caused shortly before death if Jane is not guilty. Some other scenario would have had to occur, such as misinterpreting the autopsy report, or unknown circumstances causing the hypoxia, while the injuries are from another accidental cause.\n\nLet's assume a low probability for this.\n\n10\n"

Both babies being around the same age when they died makes SIDS a plausible, albeit still statistically unlikely, explanation.\n*   **Time of day:** Babies often have feeding and sleeping routines.
