  "If Jane is not guilty, it means the hypoxic brain damage was caused by something other than her actions. This could be related to SIDS or another, yet unidentified, medical issue. The doctor's assertion links the hypoxic damage to a short period before death, which *could* still align with a sudden, acute event related to SIDS. Given that SIDS is unexplainable, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. However, the doctor's statement doesn't inherently rule out a non-Jane-inflicted cause of the hypoxic damage, even if it occurred shortly before death. We don't have enough information to say the doctor's allegation completely rules out other possibilities.\n\n40\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it's highly probable that the hypoxic damage to his brain occurred in the hours immediately preceding his death. Smothering would directly lead to oxygen deprivation and the resulting hypoxic brain damage. The doctor's statement aligns very well with this scenario.\n\n95\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, then the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung must have originated from another source than abuse/smothering. It would have to be some other, rarer explanation. While medical conditions could potentially mimic some of these signs individually, having all three together makes it less likely to be something else.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, then the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, all indicators of abuse and characteristic of smothering, become highly probable.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities are either due to coincidence, some shared but unknown risk factor related to the babies or their environment, or a rare underlying medical condition affecting both. The likelihood of *all* these specific similarities occurring by chance is relatively low, even if SIDS is a possibility. It would be a significant coincidence.\n\n15\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities become far more likely. They suggest a consistent method and opportunity.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages would have to be explained by another cause *despite* them being consistent with smothering/trauma. This suggests another, rarer medical explanation or combination of events. Given that those findings are *consistent* with violent trauma, their likelihood under a not-guilty scenario is reduced.\n\n10\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering or inflicting violent trauma, the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids become highly likely.\n\n90\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries such as petechiae is more likely. It suggests the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages might stem from another cause.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering, the *absence* of typical findings like petechiae makes the scenario slightly less straightforward. While smothering often presents with petechiae, it's not always the case. There could be variations in the technique used or the baby's physiology that explain why they weren't present. However, it is still more likely to be present than absent, given a smothering.\n\n30\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding being common in natural death and the dislocated ribs likely occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation make their presence more probable. This aligns with a scenario where some other natural cause or resuscitation attempts led to Ben's death.\n\n80\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the spinal bleeding, while common in natural death, could still be present alongside the inflicted trauma. The dislocated ribs, explained by post-mortem events or resuscitation, are less directly related to Jane's actions, although the need for resuscitation would be caused by Jane's smothering. Because the spinal bleeding *can* happen in natural death, and resuscitation attempts were made which *can* dislocate ribs, it does reduce the probability a little, compared to injuries that are *only* seen in abuse scenarios.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts makes them more likely. This aligns with the initial assessment that the injuries were caused during the attempt to revive Andy.\n\n75\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of injuries that *could* be explained by resuscitation is a mixed bag. It's plausible that some injuries were indeed inflicted during the smothering, and then further compounded by resuscitation efforts. Alternatively, Jane may have inflicted injuries that mimic those caused by resuscitation to mask the true cause of death. Since the prompt tells us the injuries are CONSISTENT with resuscitation, it does reduce the likelihood because there are other explanations for the injuries.\n\n50\n",
  "If Jane is not guilty, and the injuries truly developed *after* Ben arrived at the hospital (perhaps related to resuscitation or post-mortem changes), then it's very likely the nurses wouldn't have noted them upon arrival.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is guilty, and the injuries were inflicted *before* Ben arrived at the hospital, the fact that nurses didn't notice them suggests the injuries were either subtle, overlooked in the emergency, or perhaps not yet fully developed. It's less likely, but still possible.\n\n30\n",
  "Given the totality of the evidence - the similarities between the deaths, the injuries found in both children, the timings, and the mother being alone with the children at the time of death, balanced against the possibility of SIDS and potential alternative explanations for some injuries - it appears more likely than not that Jane is guilty. The evidence paints a concerning picture, and while not all facts point definitively to guilt, the weight of them leans in that direction.\n\n70\n",
  "Based solely on the provided information and the probabilities assessed, my simulated verdict is: Guilty.\n"
