Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Here's a breakdown of why a specific probability is difficult to assign and my reasoning:\n\n**Arguments for Guilt:**\n\n*   **Similarities in Deaths:** The age of the babies, the time of day, and Jane being alone with them each time are highly suspicious. The likelihood of these coincidences occurring naturally is low.\n*   **Injuries Inconsistent with SIDS:** The injuries to both babies, particularly the re-examined injuries to Andy and the injuries to Ben, are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" which makes SIDS less likely.\n*   **Hypoxic Damage:** The hypoxic damage occurring shortly before death is consistent with smothering.\n\n**Arguments for Innocence/Reasonable Doubt:**\n\n*   **Initial SIDS Diagnosis:** Andy's initial death being attributed to natural causes creates a seed of doubt.\n*   **Resuscitation Explanation:** The injuries could have been caused by resuscitation attempts, though this seems less plausible for all of them.\n*   **Conflicting Medical Evidence:** The spinal bleeding being linked to natural death and dislocated ribs to post-mortem or resuscitation events weakens the prosecution's case. The absence of petechiae.\n*   **Lack of Motive:** No information about motive is provided, which is important in murder cases.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe biggest factor arguing for guilt is the improbable pattern of deaths and the injuries to both babies, which are strongly suggestive of abuse. However, alternative explanations for some of the injuries and the initial SIDS diagnosis for Andy mean it's not a slam-dunk case. The lack of a stated motive also introduces uncertainty.\n\nA probability near 50/50 means that there is no strong evidence leaning one side or the other. Given that there are some injuries that are indicative of abuse, then the probability should be higher than 50/50, but the evidence that is suggestive of potential causes other than abuse, makes the probability less than, say, 90/100.\n\n75\n"
