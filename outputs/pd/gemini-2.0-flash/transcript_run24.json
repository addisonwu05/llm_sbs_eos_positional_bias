Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "Let's analyze the likelihood of these similarities occurring by chance if Jane is innocent, considering SIDS and other potential factors.\n\n*   **Age:** The babies died at roughly similar ages (11 weeks and 8 weeks). SIDS is most common between 2 and 4 months of age. This makes the timing relatively likely if SIDS is involved.\n\n*   **Time of day/After feeding:** Babies are often put to bed or rest after feeding. It's not uncommon for SIDS to occur during sleep. Thus, this similarity increases the probability somewhat.\n\n*   **Jane was alone:** This is the most problematic similarity. If SIDS occurred in both cases, statistically it would be less likely for Jane to be the *only* person present each time. However, this assumes Frank was available each time. If Frank worked odd hours, it is more probable.\n\n*   **SIDS Frequency:** The baseline SIDS frequency is 1 in 4000. Having it occur twice in the same family, while improbable, isn't impossible. This is especially true if the family has any risk factors associated with SIDS (e.g., smoking in the household, premature birth).\n\n*   **Medical Findings (Initial Autopsies):** The initial autopsy for Andy suggesting natural causes, followed by the later review discovering more, suggests there was uncertainty at the beginning.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is improbable, but not entirely impossible, that these similarities occurred by chance with SIDS. This is particularly the case if Frank was not available at those times, and that the initial Autopsy for Andy suggested natural causes.\n\nProbability: 2\n"

A mother might be more likely to act when the child is most helpless.\n\n*   **Time of day/After feeding:** This could be a deliberate choice to mask the act. Feeding and then putting the baby to bed creates a plausible narrative for a sudden death.\n\n*   **Jane was alone:** This is a crucial factor. A guilty party would need to engineer a situation where they are alone with the child.\n\n*   **Consistency:** A perpetrator would likely aim for consistency in their actions to reduce the risk of detection and create a pattern that, if noticed, could be explained as a tragic coincidence.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the similarities are quite likely.\n\nProbability: 90\n"
