Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

While SIDS is defined as \"sudden and unexplainable,\" the injuries found during the autopsies require explanation regardless of whether the death was caused by SIDS, smothering, or other factors.\n\nThe doctor alleges the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurred a matter of hours before his death. If Jane is not guilty, there needs to be a plausible mechanism for this hypoxic damage that doesn't involve her intentional actions.\n\nGiven that SIDS is considered, it is possible that some other underlying medical condition or event caused both the injuries and the hypoxic event. If SIDS is not the direct cause of death, then some unidentified underlying medical condition is to blame. It could also be that mishandling the baby caused injury, but this is speculative.\n\nIt is likely that the finding by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death is accurate; the question is the mechanism that caused this. Assuming the doctor's assertion is reasonably accurate, regardless of Jane's guilt, the hypoxic damage *did* occur shortly before death.

Let's break down the similarities:\n\n*   **Age:** Both babies died around the same age (8-11 weeks). Infant mortality rates are highest in the first few months of life, so it's not entirely unusual for two infants in the same family to die at a similar young age due to natural causes.\n\n*   **Time of day after feeding:** Feeding is a regular event in a baby's life. So, two babies dying shortly after feeding isn't completely surprising, especially if a potential underlying cause (like SIDS or another medical issue) is triggered or exacerbated by feeding or the post-feeding period (e.g., reflux).\n\n*   **Jane being alone:** This is the most crucial point. If Jane is innocent, it's either an incredibly unfortunate coincidence, or there's something about the babies' care routine or her role as a caregiver that makes her presence more likely when something goes wrong (without her actively causing it).\n\nGiven the similarities, it would be statistically quite rare for this to happen if SIDS is the cause. SIDS is rare (1 in 4000). The odds of this happening twice to the same parents is even lower. If something else is to blame, like another underlying health condition, then there is no data to determine how likely this is to happen. Considering how similar the circumstances are, the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty is low, but not impossible due to potential shared genetics or environmental factors.\n\n10\n"
