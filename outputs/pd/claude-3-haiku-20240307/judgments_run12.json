  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in the case of Andy's death is quite unlikely. These findings are typically indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse, which would be inconsistent with a natural, unexplained death like SIDS.\n\nGiven the statistics provided, the frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls. In the absence of any evidence of intentional harm, the presence of these injuries is not what one would typically expect to find in a SIDS case.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these injuries would be present if Jane is not guilty is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is unlikely.

  "If Jane is not guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are quite unlikely. The fact that both babies were about the same age, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them is highly suspicious and would be expected if Jane had intentionally harmed the children.\n\nIn the absence of any clear evidence of foul play, the probability of these striking similarities occurring by chance in two unrelated SIDS cases is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents are highly likely. The fact that both babies were about the same age, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them is consistent with a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nGiven the details provided in the case, these striking similarities would be expected if Jane had indeed murdered both of her children.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. In cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the precise cause and timing of the brain damage leading to death is often unclear and can be difficult to pinpoint.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, the assertion that the brain damage was caused just hours before death would be speculative and unlikely to be the case in a SIDS scenario.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is highly likely. The doctor's assertion that the brain damage must have been caused just hours before death is consistent with a scenario where Jane intentionally caused harm to the child, such as through smothering.\n\nGiven the details of the case and the charges against Jane, this timing of the brain damage would be expected if she had committed the alleged crimes.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries at the time suggests they may have developed or worsened after the initial hospital visit.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is innocent, the injuries being missed or not yet visible during the initial assessment would be a plausible explanation.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries at the time suggests they may have been deliberately hidden or overlooked, rather than not yet visible.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of harming her child, the injuries being missed or not yet apparent during the initial assessment would be less plausible, as she may have deliberately concealed the evidence of her actions.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found in Andy's case were consistent with the resuscitation attempts, as initially assessed. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung can all be plausibly explained by the emergency medical interventions to try to revive the baby.\n\nIn the absence of evidence of intentional harm, these injuries would be expected to be present in a case of sudden infant death, where resuscitation efforts were made.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy's case being solely due to resuscitation attempts is low. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are more indicative of intentional harm, such as smothering, rather than just the result of emergency medical interventions.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the pattern of injuries across both children, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case were caused by Jane's actions is relatively high.\n\nProbability judgment: 70",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were the result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts, as suggested. These types of injuries are not necessarily indicative of intentional harm in a sudden infant death scenario.\n\nWithout clear evidence of foul play, the probability that these specific findings were simply due to natural processes or medical intervention, rather than Jane's actions, is quite high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were solely the result of natural causes or resuscitation attempts is lower. While these types of injuries can occur in natural deaths or during medical intervention, their presence alongside the other evidence of intentional harm (such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages) suggests a more complex scenario.\n\nGiven the charges against Jane and the overall pattern of evidence, the probability that these specific injuries were simply due to natural processes or medical intervention, rather than being part of Jane's actions, is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 40",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is highly likely. In cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes, the absence of these specific injuries would be expected, as they are more characteristic of intentional suffocation.\n\nWithout clear evidence of foul play, the probability that Ben's death occurred due to natural causes or other non-intentional factors, and thus lacked the presence of petechiae, is quite high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, is less likely. The presence of other injuries indicative of intentional harm, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, suggests that the lack of petechiae may be due to factors other than natural causes.\n\nIn a scenario where Jane is guilty of murdering her child, the probability that Ben's death would lack the presence of petechiae and other smothering-related injuries is relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented in the case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is high.\n\nThe key factors that contribute to this assessment are:\n\n1. The presence of injuries on both children, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and hypoxic brain damage, that are highly indicative of intentional harm like smothering.\n\n2. The striking similarities between the two incidents, including the timing and circumstances of the deaths, which is unlikely to occur by chance in unrelated SIDS cases.\n\n3. The doctor's assessment that the brain damage in Ben's case was caused just hours before death, consistent with intentional harm.\n\n4. The lower likelihood that the injuries would be present if Jane was not guilty, as opposed to the higher probability if she is guilty.\n\nConsidering the overall weight of the evidence, the probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\nProbability judgment: 80",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
