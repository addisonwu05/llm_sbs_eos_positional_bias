  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low. These findings are typically associated with smothering or other forms of abuse, which would be inconsistent with a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS (1 in 4,000 in the UK) and the lack of a clear mechanism or cause, the presence of these specific injuries is not a common or expected outcome in a true SIDS case. Therefore, the probability that these findings would be present in Andy's case if Jane is not guilty is relatively low.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high.\n\nThese findings are highly indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse, which would be consistent with a case of homicide. The presence of these specific injuries, along with the subsequent death of the second child, Ben, strongly suggests a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these findings would be present in Andy's case if Jane is guilty is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively high.\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a condition that can result in rapid and unexpected infant death, and it is often associated with hypoxic damage to the brain. The medical examiner's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused just prior to Ben's death is not necessarily consistent with a SIDS case, as SIDS can involve a gradual process of oxygen deprivation.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n75",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe medical examiner's statement that the hypoxic damage must have been caused just prior to Ben's death is consistent with a case of intentional smothering or other form of asphyxiation. In a situation where the caregiver is responsible for the child's death, the hypoxic damage would likely be the result of a deliberate and sudden act, rather than a gradual process as seen in SIDS cases.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is relatively low.\n\nThe coincidence of both babies being around the same age, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would be quite remarkable if the deaths were truly due to natural causes or SIDS.\n\nThe rarity of SIDS and the highly unusual nature of these specific similarities between the two incidents make it improbable that these would occur by chance if Jane is not guilty of intentionally harming the children.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these similarities would exist between the two incidents if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is very high.\n\nThe striking similarities in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the two children, such as their ages, the timing of the incidents, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, would be highly consistent with a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering both children, the presence of these specific similarities in the incidents would be expected, as they could indicate a modus operandi or a recurring method of committing the crimes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these similarities would exist between the two incidents if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThese specific injuries are strongly associated with smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be inconsistent with a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the lack of a clear mechanism or cause for this condition, the presence of these types of injuries is not a common or expected outcome in a true SIDS case. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these injuries being present is relatively low.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high.\n\nThese specific injuries are highly indicative of smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be consistent with a case of intentional harm. The presence of these types of injuries, along with the subsequent death of the first child, Andy, strongly suggests a pattern of abuse and murder.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being present is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe injuries, such as bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, can commonly occur as a result of the vigorous and forceful techniques used in attempting to revive an infant. These types of injuries are not necessarily indicative of abuse or smothering, especially if the initial autopsy had attributed them to the resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven that Jane called an ambulance and the baby was transported to the hospital, the presence of these injuries is plausible if the death was due to natural causes or SIDS, and not intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the subsequent death of the second child, Ben, and the medical examiner's findings of abuse and smothering, the injuries to Andy's body are more likely to be indicative of intentional harm rather than merely being the result of resuscitation efforts.\n\nThe presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, when considered in the broader context of the case, suggests a pattern of abuse that is inconsistent with a natural or accidental death. If Jane is guilty, these injuries are more likely to have been caused by intentional actions rather than being an artifact of the resuscitation attempts.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note any injuries when Ben was first brought in suggests that the injuries, such as the rib fractures, spinal cord damage, and internal hemorrhages, likely occurred sometime after he was admitted to the hospital, rather than before.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, it would be reasonable to expect that the medical staff would have observed and documented any visible injuries when he was first brought in for treatment. The absence of these findings initially supports the idea that the injuries were not present at that time.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane is responsible for Ben's death through intentional harm, such as smothering or other violent acts, it is more likely that the injuries observed during the autopsy, including the rib fractures, spinal cord damage, and internal hemorrhages, were already present when Ben was first brought to the hospital.\n\nThe medical staff's failure to observe and document these injuries at that time could suggest a deliberate attempt to conceal the evidence of abuse. If Jane is guilty, she may have been able to hide the injuries from the initial medical examination, only for them to be discovered during the more thorough autopsy.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe medical examiner's statements indicate that these specific injuries are not necessarily indicative of intentional harm. Spinal bleeding can occur in cases of natural death, and dislocated ribs can result from the vigorous resuscitation efforts performed on an infant.\n\nGiven the lack of other clear evidence of abuse, and the possibility of these injuries being caused by legitimate medical interventions, it is plausible that they were not the result of any intentional actions by Jane, if she is indeed not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the other evidence of intentional harm, such as the hypoxic brain damage and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are more likely to have been caused by the same pattern of abuse, rather than being the result of natural processes or medical interventions.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the presence of these specific injuries, in addition to the other evidence of trauma, would be consistent with a deliberate and violent act that led to Ben's death. The medical examiner's statements about the potential for natural or post-mortem causes would carry less weight in the context of the broader evidence against Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high.\n\nPetechiae are a common sign of smothering or other forms of asphyxiation, as they are caused by the burst blood vessels in the skin due to increased pressure. However, their absence does not necessarily rule out smothering as the cause of death, as they can sometimes be absent even in cases of intentional suffocation.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, the lack of petechiae or other typical smothering injuries would be more expected. The medical examiner's finding of hypoxic damage and other injuries could have alternative explanations that do not involve intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low.\n\nPetechiae are a common and expected finding in cases of smothering or other forms of asphyxiation, which is consistent with the evidence of intentional harm against Ben, such as the hypoxic brain damage and other injuries.\n\nThe absence of these typical smothering injuries, while not conclusive, would be less expected if Jane is indeed guilty of murdering Ben. The medical examiner's inability to find petechiae or similar indicators of suffocation could suggest that the method of killing was not a straightforward case of smothering, or that there were other factors that prevented these types of injuries from manifesting.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n30",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented in this case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n75",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
