  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with SIDS is relatively high.\n\nSIDS is a leading cause of infant mortality, and the medical examiner's findings in Ben's case, such as the hypoxic brain damage and retinal hemorrhages, can occur in some SIDS cases. While these findings can also be associated with smothering or other forms of trauma, they are not pathognomonic (uniquely diagnostic) for homicide.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the fact that the first child's death was attributed to natural causes, if Jane is indeed not guilty, the likelihood of the observed findings in Ben's case being consistent with SIDS is approximately 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is very high.\n\nThe medical examiner's findings, including the hypoxic brain damage and retinal hemorrhages, are strongly suggestive of asphyxiation or severe trauma, which are common in cases of intentional smothering or other forms of physical abuse. These types of injuries are not typically associated with SIDS.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood of the observed findings in Ben's case being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is approximately 95%.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's re-examination being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low.\n\nWhile these findings can be associated with intentional harm, they can also occur in some natural or accidental deaths, particularly in young infants. Torn frenulums, for example, can happen during normal feeding or handling of a baby. Bruises and pulmonary hemorrhages can also result from resuscitation attempts or other medical interventions.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the fact that Andy's initial autopsy attributed his death to natural causes, if Jane is indeed not guilty, the likelihood of the observed findings in Andy's case being consistent with smothering or abuse is approximately 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in Andy's re-examination being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is very high.\n\nThese types of injuries, especially when found in conjunction, are strongly suggestive of intentional harm and are commonly associated with cases of smothering or other forms of physical abuse in infants. The presence of these findings, after the initial autopsy had attributed Andy's death to natural causes, further supports the likelihood of foul play.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood of the observed findings in Andy's case being consistent with smothering or abuse is approximately 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is relatively low.\n\nIn cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a possible explanation if Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic brain damage can occur over a longer period of time, not necessarily just a few hours before death. SIDS is often characterized by a gradual deterioration of the infant's condition leading to death, rather than a sudden catastrophic event.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the possibility of SIDS as an explanation if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is approximately 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is very high.\n\nIn cases of intentional smothering or other forms of acute trauma, the hypoxic brain damage would typically occur in a short timeframe, often just hours before the infant's death. This is because the interruption of oxygen supply during the act of smothering or other violent actions would lead to rapid deterioration of the brain's condition.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death is approximately 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between the two incidents is relatively high.\n\nThe factors mentioned, such as the babies being of similar ages, dying at similar times of day after being fed, and both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are not necessarily indicative of foul play. These circumstances can be coincidental and may align with the natural progression and timing of events in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the information provided, and the possibility of SIDS as an explanation if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is approximately 70%.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe factors mentioned, such as the babies being of similar ages, dying at similar times of day after being fed, and both being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are highly indicative of a pattern of intentional behavior. In cases of child murder, the perpetrator often exhibits a repetitive modus operandi, which can result in these types of similarities between the incidents.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is approximately 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely due to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, rather than an indication of intentional harm. These types of findings are not necessarily inconsistent with a natural or accidental cause of death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is approximately 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are not necessarily indicative of intentional harm, but rather can be associated with natural deaths or resuscitation efforts. In cases of intentional smothering or other forms of abuse, these specific findings would be less likely to be present.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben's case is approximately 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is very high.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the bruises, torn frenulum, and pulmonary hemorrhage found in Andy's case can be attributed to the resuscitation efforts made to try to revive him, rather than being indicative of abuse or smothering. This is a plausible explanation if Jane is indeed not guilty.\n\nGiven the context provided, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is approximately 90%.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the bruises, torn frenulum, and pulmonary hemorrhage found in Andy's case are characteristic of abuse and smothering, rather than being solely attributable to resuscitation efforts. If Jane is guilty of harming her children, these injuries are more likely to be the result of intentional harm rather than medical intervention.\n\nGiven the context provided, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is approximately 30%.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high.\n\nPetechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering or other forms of asphyxiation, but their absence does not definitively rule out SIDS as a cause of death. Some infants who die of SIDS may not exhibit these types of injuries, as the exact mechanisms and pathophysiology of SIDS are not fully understood.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the possibility of SIDS as an explanation if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is approximately 80%.\n\n80",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note the injuries, such as the hypoxic brain damage and retinal hemorrhages, when Ben was initially brought to the hospital suggests that these injuries may have developed or worsened after the initial medical intervention. This would be more consistent with a natural or accidental cause of death, such as SIDS, rather than intentional harm.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the possibility of SIDS as an explanation if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nIn cases of intentional harm, such as smothering, the injuries would be expected to be present and observable by the medical staff when the child is first brought in for treatment. The fact that the nurses did not note these injuries at that time suggests that they may have developed or worsened later, which would be less likely if Jane is guilty of causing them.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is indeed guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is approximately 30%.\n\n30",
