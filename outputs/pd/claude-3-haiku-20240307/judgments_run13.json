  "If Jane is not guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of SIDS rather than smothering is relatively high.\n\nSIDS is a complex and not fully understood phenomenon, and the specific findings in Andy's case could potentially be explained by the natural mechanisms underlying SIDS, rather than intentional abuse. While the presence of these findings may raise suspicion, they are not necessarily conclusive evidence of smothering.\n\nGiven the information provided, and the understanding that SIDS is a relatively common occurrence, the probability that these findings are consistent with SIDS, rather than intentional harm, is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of smothering is very high.\n\nThese findings are characteristic of intentional suffocation or smothering, and would be highly consistent with Jane having committed the alleged crimes.\n\nGiven the presented evidence, if Jane is guilty, the probability that these findings are indicative of smothering rather than SIDS is:\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that there would be these striking similarities between the two incidents is relatively low.\n\nThe coincidence of both babies dying at a similar age, time of day, and when Jane was alone with them would be quite unusual if these were truly natural, unrelated SIDS deaths. The similarities raise significant suspicion and make it less likely that Jane is innocent.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents would occur is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that there would be these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe striking parallels in the circumstances of the two deaths, including the age of the babies, the time of day, and Jane being alone with them, would be highly consistent with a premeditated pattern of behavior. These similarities strengthen the case that the deaths were not natural or accidental, but rather intentional acts committed by Jane.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents would occur is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively high.\n\nHypoxic brain injury can occur due to various natural and unintentional causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, or other medical conditions. The timing of the hypoxic damage does not necessarily imply intentional harm, and could be consistent with a sudden and unexpected medical event leading to the infant's death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe medical evidence suggesting that the hypoxic damage occurred shortly before Ben's death would be highly consistent with Jane intentionally causing harm to the infant, such as by smothering or suffocating him. This timing of the brain injury supports the hypothesis that Jane's actions directly led to Ben's death, rather than it being a natural or unintentional occurrence.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is relatively low.\n\nWhile these medical findings can be indicative of intentional harm, they can also potentially be explained by natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other unintentional medical events. Without clear evidence of deliberate actions by Jane, the probability that these injuries are the result of smothering or trauma is diminished.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is very high.\n\nThese medical findings are highly characteristic of intentional suffocation or physical abuse, and would be strongly supportive of the hypothesis that Jane committed these acts. The presence of these injuries, along with the other evidence presented, would significantly increase the likelihood that Jane is guilty of the alleged crimes.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case are consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the initial autopsy concluded Andy's death was due to natural causes, and the injuries found were attributed to the resuscitation efforts made by medical personnel. Given the fragile nature of an infant's body, such injuries are commonly seen in cases of attempted resuscitation, and do not necessarily imply intentional harm.\n\nAssuming Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case are consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case are consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the similarities between the two incidents and the subsequent discovery of additional evidence of abuse in Andy's case, it becomes less likely that the injuries were solely the result of resuscitation efforts. The presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung suggest a pattern of intentional harm that would be more consistent with Jane being guilty of smothering or otherwise causing Andy's death.\n\nAssuming Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy's case are consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n40%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided suggests that spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred either during the resuscitation efforts or post-mortem, without necessarily implying intentional harm. Given the lack of clear evidence of foul play, these medical findings would be more consistent with an accidental or natural death scenario if Jane is not guilty.\n\nAssuming Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the other evidence suggesting that Jane intentionally caused harm to her children, the presence of these specific injuries would be more likely to be the result of her actions rather than natural causes or resuscitation efforts. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, in the context of the overall case, would be more indicative of deliberate trauma inflicted by Jane.\n\nAssuming Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively high.\n\nThe lack of these specific injuries, which are often associated with suffocation or smothering, would be more consistent with a natural or accidental death, rather than an intentional act of harm. The information provided suggests that the other injuries found, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, can have other explanations besides smothering.\n\nAssuming Jane is not guilty, the probability that the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane is truly guilty of intentionally harming or smothering her children, the lack of these characteristic injuries would be unexpected and less likely. The presence of other injuries associated with suffocation, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, but the absence of petechiae or similar indicators, would be unusual in a case of intentional smothering.\n\nAssuming Jane is guilty, the probability that the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe fact that the nurses did not note these injuries at the time Ben was admitted suggests they may have occurred or worsened after he arrived at the hospital, potentially during resuscitation efforts or other medical interventions. If Jane is not guilty, this would be a more likely explanation for the presence of the injuries discovered later during the autopsy.\n\nAssuming Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane intentionally harmed Ben, it is more likely that the injuries discovered during the autopsy would have been present prior to his arrival at the hospital, rather than occurring later during medical treatment. The lack of observation of these injuries by the nurses would be less consistent with Jane's guilt, as it suggests the injuries may have developed or worsened after the initial admission.\n\nAssuming Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%\n\nThe key factors that contribute to this assessment are:\n\n1) The striking similarities between the two incidents, including the ages of the infants, the timing, and Jane's presence alone with the babies when they died - these similarities make it less likely the deaths were unrelated natural causes.\n\n2) The medical evidence of injuries and trauma in both cases, particularly the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages in Ben's case, which are highly indicative of intentional suffocation or smothering.\n\n3) The inability to fully explain all the evidence, such as the missing petechiae in Ben's case, if Jane is assumed to be innocent.\n\nWhile there are some factors that could support Jane's innocence, the overall weight of the evidence, especially the medical findings and the parallels between the two incidents, suggests there is a substantial probability that Jane is guilty as charged.",
  "Based on the evidence and my probability assessment, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
