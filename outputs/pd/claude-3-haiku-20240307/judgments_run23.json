  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is quite low. The sudden and unexplained deaths of two children in the family, both at a similar age and under similar circumstances, would be highly unusual and raise significant suspicion, even in the context of SIDS.\n\nGiven the additional medical evidence found in the autopsy of the second child, Ben, which suggests non-natural causes of death, the probability that these similarities would occur by chance if Jane were not guilty is relatively small.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is very high.\n\nThe similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of the two children, such as the age at death, the time of day, and the fact that Jane was alone with the babies when they died, would be expected if she had intentionally smothered both of them.\n\nAdditionally, the medical evidence found in the autopsy of the second child, Ben, further corroborates the suspicion of foul play, as the injuries and hemorrhages are consistent with non-natural causes of death.\n\nGiven the overall pattern of events, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities occurring is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe medical evidence of these specific injuries is more consistent with non-natural causes of death, such as smothering or other forms of violent trauma, rather than sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes.\n\nGiven the context of the two similar deaths within the family, the presence of these severe injuries in the autopsy of the second child, Ben, would be highly unusual and unlikely to occur by chance if Jane were not responsible.\n\n20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nThe medical evidence suggesting the hypoxic damage occurred shortly before Ben's death would be highly unusual and unlikely in a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. SIDS typically does not involve such acute and recent brain injury.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances surrounding Ben's death, including the previous unexplained death of the first child, the doctor's assertion that the brain damage was caused just hours before death would raise significant doubts about the possibility of natural causes if Jane was not responsible.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe medical evidence suggesting the hypoxic damage occurred shortly before Ben's death would be highly consistent with a deliberate and recent act of smothering or other violent trauma inflicted by Jane. This timeline of the brain injury would align with Jane being responsible for Ben's death.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances surrounding both of the children's deaths, the doctor's assertion that the brain damage was caused just hours before Ben's death would be a strong indicator of Jane's guilt, as it points to a non-natural and intentional cause of the infant's demise.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is very low.\n\nThese types of injuries are highly indicative of abuse, particularly smothering, rather than natural causes of death. Their presence, even upon re-examination of the initial autopsy, would be highly unusual and concerning in the absence of clear evidence of foul play.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances surrounding both of the children's deaths, the discovery of these characteristic signs of abuse in the first child's case would be very unlikely to occur if Jane was not responsible for their deaths.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high.\n\nThese types of injuries are highly characteristic of smothering or other forms of abusive behavior, which would be expected if Jane intentionally caused the death of her first child, Andy. The discovery of these signs of trauma upon re-examination of the initial autopsy would strongly corroborate the suspicion of foul play.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances surrounding both children's deaths, the presence of these clear indicators of abuse in the first child's case would be a strong piece of evidence supporting the conclusion that Jane was responsible for the deaths of both Andy and Ben.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high.\n\nThe medical examiner's assessment that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and that the dislocated ribs were likely due to post-mortem or resuscitation efforts, suggests these injuries are not necessarily indicative of foul play.\n\nIn the context of a potential Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) case, where the cause of death is unexplained, the presence of these types of injuries would not be considered highly unusual or suspicious if Jane was not responsible for Ben's death.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively low.\n\nWhile the medical examiner has indicated that the spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs may have occurred during resuscitation efforts, these injuries would not be the primary focus if Jane had intentionally caused Ben's death through smothering or other non-accidental trauma.\n\nGiven the other evidence of hypoxic brain damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages that are more indicative of intentional suffocation, the presence of the spinal bleeding and rib dislocations would be less central to the case against Jane if she were guilty of Ben's murder.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is very high.\n\nThe medical examiner's initial assessment that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were likely the result of the resuscitation efforts to revive Andy is a plausible explanation, especially for a baby. These types of injuries are common consequences of CPR and other lifesaving measures performed on infants.\n\nGiven the lack of other evidence pointing to abuse or foul play, and the fact that the initial autopsy concluded Andy's death was due to natural causes, the injuries found would be expected if Jane was not responsible for his death. Their presence alone does not necessarily indicate any wrongdoing on Jane's part if she is not guilty.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is low.\n\nIf Jane intentionally smothered or harmed her first child, Andy, the injuries found - including the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung - would be more likely to be the result of that abusive behavior rather than simply the consequences of resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances surrounding both of the children's deaths, and the presence of additional evidence of non-natural causes in the case of the second child, Ben, the injuries found in Andy's initial autopsy would be viewed with much more scrutiny if Jane were guilty.\n\nThe medical examiner's initial assessment may have been mistaken, and the injuries could in fact be indicative of smothering or other forms of abuse perpetrated by Jane.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very high.\n\nThe fact that the medical staff at the hospital did not note or observe the injuries to Ben's body, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, suggests these injuries likely occurred after he was brought in and potentially after resuscitation efforts.\n\nIf Jane was not responsible for harming Ben, and his death was due to natural causes or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), it would be plausible that the injuries detected during the autopsy were not visible or present when he was initially transported to the hospital.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is low.\n\nIf Jane intentionally caused the injuries to Ben, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, it is unlikely that these would have gone unnoticed by the medical staff upon his arrival at the hospital. The severity of these injuries would have been observable and documented.\n\nThe fact that the hospital staff did not note the presence of these injuries indicates they likely occurred either during or after the failed resuscitation efforts, suggesting Jane may have inflicted the harm prior to Ben being brought in.\n\nGiven the suspicious circumstances and the other evidence pointing to Jane's potential guilt, the likelihood that the injuries were not present when Ben arrived at the hospital is relatively low if Jane is in fact responsible for his death.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is high.\n\nThe lack of typical smothering-related injuries, like petechiae, would be more consistent with a natural or unexplained death, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), rather than an intentional act of suffocation.\n\nGiven that the other injuries found, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, can also occur in natural infant deaths, their presence without the more definitive signs of smothering would make it more plausible that Jane was not responsible for Ben's death if she is not guilty.\n\nThe absence of the expected petechiae or other telltale signs of suffocation would support the possibility that Ben's death was not due to intentional smothering by Jane.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low.\n\nThe lack of typical smothering-related injuries, like petechiae, would be unexpected if Jane had intentionally caused Ben's death by suffocation. Petechiae are a common finding in cases of smothering or asphyxiation, and their absence would be unusual.\n\nGiven the other medical evidence of non-natural causes, such as the hypoxic brain damage and hemorrhages, the absence of petechiae or other definitive signs of suffocation would be concerning and cast doubt on the possibility of Jane's guilt if she had indeed smothered Ben.\n\nThe lack of these telltale smothering injuries, despite the presence of other suspicious findings, would make it less likely that Jane is guilty of Ben's murder.\n\n30",
  "Based on the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is 70.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, the medical evidence of non-natural causes of death in the case of Ben, and the additional injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's case all point to a strong likelihood of Jane's guilt.\n\nWhile some of the evidence, such as the spinal bleeding and lack of petechiae in Ben's case, could be consistent with natural causes, the overall pattern and timeline of events, as well as the specific injuries observed, suggest a high probability that Jane is responsible for the deaths of both of her children.\n\n70",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
