  "If Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of finding the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low, as these findings are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of physical abuse.\n\nGiven the frequency of SIDS being 1 in 4,000 in the UK, and the fact that SIDS is more common among boys than girls, the likelihood of these findings in a case of SIDS is relatively low.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that some of these findings, such as bruises or minor injuries, could potentially occur in SIDS cases due to resuscitation efforts or other natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is estimated to be:\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty of murdering her children, the likelihood of finding the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high, as these findings are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of physical abuse.\n\nGiven the background information provided, which suggests that the injuries to Ben were indicative of abuse and that further investigation of Andy's case found similar evidence, it is highly likely that the findings in Andy's case were also the result of abuse and smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is relatively low.\n\nGiven the information provided about sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a sudden and unexplainable death of infants during their first year of life, it is possible that the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages observed in Ben's case could be the result of natural causes or other factors not related to smothering or abuse.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is very high.\n\nThe background information provided indicates that the injuries to Ben, including the hypoxic damage and haemorrhages, were discovered during the autopsy and were characteristic of abuse and smothering. Given this evidence, and the fact that Jane is being charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, it is highly likely that these injuries were the result of her actions.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is relatively high.\n\nGiven the information provided, the similarities between the two incidents, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could potentially be coincidental.\n\nWhile the similarities are striking, they do not necessarily indicate that Jane is guilty of murdering her children. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a real phenomenon that can occur without any clear cause, and the provided information suggests that SIDS is more common among boys.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these similarities between both incidents are purely coincidental is estimated to be:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents is very high.\n\nThe background information provided suggests that the similarities, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at a similar time of day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are indicative of a pattern of behavior.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder, the similarities between the two incidents are more likely to be the result of a deliberate and premeditated action on her part, rather than mere coincidence.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that these similarities between both incidents are the result of her intentional actions is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively high.\n\nWithout concrete evidence of Jane's involvement in the death of her children, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain could have been caused by a variety of factors, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes. The information provided does not rule out the possibility that the hypoxic damage occurred shortly before Ben's death due to natural circumstances.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the doctor alleged the hypoxic damage must have been caused a matter of hours before Ben's death. This suggests that the damage was recent and not the result of a more gradual or natural process.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused shortly before his death is more consistent with an intentional act of smothering or other forms of abuse, rather than natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the initial post-mortem on Andy suggested natural causes of death, and the injuries found (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts. This is a plausible explanation, as such injuries can be common in the process of reviving an infant, especially one who has suffered a sudden and unexplained death.\n\nWithout clear evidence of foul play, and given the possibility of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the injuries found in Andy's case could reasonably be explained by the resuscitation efforts alone.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n75%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe background information provided indicates that further investigation of Andy's case found additional evidence of abuse, such as bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These findings are more characteristic of smothering or other forms of physical trauma, rather than resuscitation attempts alone.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, the injuries found in Andy's case are more likely to be the result of intentional harm rather than accidental causes. The initial attribution of the injuries to resuscitation efforts may have been an attempt to cover up the true nature of the infant's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries, including the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids, were only discovered during the autopsy. The fact that these injuries were not noted by the nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital suggests that they may have developed or become more severe after he was admitted.\n\nWithout clear evidence of Jane's involvement in Ben's death, it is plausible that the injuries observed during the autopsy could have occurred due to natural causes or other factors not related to intentional harm. The lack of observable injuries at the time of admission supports the possibility that the injuries were not present when Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be:\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, it is more likely that the injuries observed during the autopsy, including the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids, were the result of intentional harm inflicted by Jane.\n\nThe fact that these injuries were not noted by the nurses when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest that Jane took steps to conceal or downplay the severity of the injuries, or that the injuries were inflicted shortly before Ben's death in an attempt to cover up the true nature of the incident.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural death or resuscitation efforts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely caused either post-mortem or due to the resuscitation attempts. This suggests that these injuries are not necessarily indicative of intentional harm or abuse.\n\nGiven the possibility of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as a potential cause of Ben's death, and the fact that Jane is not guilty, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs can reasonably be attributed to natural causes or the medical interventions performed to try and revive Ben.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural death or resuscitation efforts is estimated to be:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural death or resuscitation efforts is relatively low.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, the injuries observed in Ben's case, including the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, are more likely to be the result of intentional harm or abuse, rather than natural causes or medical interventions.\n\nThe information provided suggests that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are not necessarily indicative of foul play on their own, but when considered in the context of the other evidence and Jane's guilt, these injuries are more likely to be the result of the same intentional actions that led to Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were the result of natural death or resuscitation efforts is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that while Ben's autopsy revealed certain injuries, such as hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, it did not find other typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae.\n\nGiven the possibility of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other natural causes as the explanation for Ben's death, the absence of petechiae or other smothering-related injuries would be more consistent with a non-intentional cause of death. The lack of these specific injuries does not align with the assumption of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the injuries found in Ben's autopsy, including the hypoxic damage to the brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxiation. The absence of other typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be unexpected if Jane is guilty of intentionally causing Ben's death.\n\nGiven that Jane is charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of her children, the lack of petechiae or similar smothering-related injuries would be more likely to occur if the cause of death was not intentional harm, but rather natural causes or an accidental incident. The absence of these injuries is less consistent with Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of murdering her two children is estimated to be:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
