  "If Jane is not guilty of the murders of her two children, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents occurring by chance is relatively low.\n\nThe similarities, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at similar times of the day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, are quite striking. The fact that both babies also died of unexplained causes (initially for the first child, and then later revealed injuries for the second child) further adds to the suspicious nature of the incidents.\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS, the probability of these two highly similar incidents occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty is quite low. The frequency of SIDS in the UK is around 1 in 4,000, which means the chances of two SIDS deaths in the same family are exceedingly rare.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities between the two incidents is estimated to be:\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murders of her two children, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe similarities, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at similar times of the day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, would be expected if Jane had intentionally caused the deaths of both children.\n\nThe fact that the first child's death was initially attributed to natural causes, while the second child's death revealed injuries, is also consistent with a guilty scenario. Jane may have intentionally smothered or harmed the children in a way that would not immediately be detected as murder, and the similarities between the incidents would make it more plausible that they were both accidental or due to natural causes.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities between the two incidents is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThe autopsy findings of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma, which would suggest intentional harm to the child. If Jane is truly not guilty, then these specific injuries would be less likely to have occurred, as they are not typically associated with natural causes of death or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nThe presence of these injuries, which point towards a non-accidental cause of death, would be surprising if Jane is innocent. The more likely explanation for such findings would be that Jane had indeed harmed or smothered the child, leading to these specific injuries.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is estimated to be:\n\n20%",

If Jane is indeed guilty of murdering her son Ben, then these specific injuries would be the expected result of her actions.\n\nThe presence of these injuries, which point towards a non-accidental cause of death, would be highly likely if Jane had intentionally harmed or smothered the child. These types of injuries are strongly associated with cases of intentional suffocation or asphyxiation, which aligns with the alleged crime.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is estimated to be:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is low.\n\nThe findings of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, as mentioned in the background information. If Jane is truly not guilty of harming her children, then these types of injuries would be unexpected and unlikely to be present.\n\nThe re-examination of Andy's death revealing these signs of potential abuse would be surprising if Jane had not intentionally caused harm to the child. These injuries are not typically associated with natural causes of death or SIDS, which is the more plausible explanation if Jane is innocent.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case is estimated to be:\n\n20%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nThe doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused just hours before Ben's death would suggest a more acute and intentional cause of the injury, such as smothering or other violent trauma. If Jane is truly not guilty, then this specific timing of the brain damage would be less likely, as it is not typically associated with natural causes of death or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nThe presence of this acute brain damage, with a narrow time frame before the child's death, would be surprising if Jane is innocent. The more likely explanation for such a finding would be that Jane had indeed caused the harm to the child, leading to the hypoxic damage just prior to the death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be:\n\n30%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is relatively high.\n\nThe absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be more expected if Jane had not intentionally caused harm to the child. Petechiae are often seen in cases of asphyxiation or suffocation, and their absence could suggest that the death was not due to smothering.\n\nIf Jane is truly innocent, then the lack of these additional injuries, despite the presence of other findings like hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, would be more plausible. The cause of death may have been due to natural or unintentional factors, rather than intentional smothering.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is estimated to be:\n\n70%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe background information states that the initial injuries found in Andy, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts made to revive the child. These types of injuries are often seen in cases where emergency medical procedures are performed, especially on infants.\n\nIf Jane is truly not guilty of harming her child, then the explanation that these injuries were caused by the resuscitation efforts would be the more plausible scenario. The presence of these injuries would not necessarily indicate intentional abuse or smothering, but rather the expected consequences of the attempts to save the baby's life.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n80%",

However, if Jane is indeed guilty of harming her child, then these injuries may not be solely the result of the resuscitation efforts.\n\nIf Jane had intentionally caused harm to Andy, such as by smothering or abusing the child, then the presence of these injuries would be more likely to be indicative of that abusive behavior, rather than being solely the consequence of the medical interventions to try and save the baby's life.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high.\n\nThe background information states that the spinal bleeding found in Ben is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely the result of post-mortem changes or the resuscitation attempts. If Jane is truly not guilty of harming her child, then these injuries would be more plausibly explained by natural causes or the emergency medical interventions, rather than intentional abuse.\n\nThe presence of these injuries, which are not typically associated with smothering or other forms of intentional harm, would be expected if Jane had not caused the death of her child. The medical examiner's assessment that these findings are consistent with natural causes or resuscitation efforts would support the conclusion that Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is estimated to be:\n\n80%",

However, if Jane is indeed guilty of harming her child, then these injuries may not be solely the result of natural causes or medical interventions.\n\nIf Jane had intentionally caused harm to Ben, such as by smothering or abusing the child, then the presence of these specific injuries may not be as readily explained by the provided information. The medical examiner's assessment that these findings are consistent with natural causes or resuscitation efforts may not align with the scenario of Jane being guilty of the child's murder.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is estimated to be:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe background information states that the injuries found on Ben during the autopsy, such as the hypoxic damage to his brain and the hemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids, were not noted by the nurses when he was initially brought to the hospital. This suggests that these injuries may have occurred or worsened after he was admitted, rather than being present from the start.\n\nIf Jane is truly not guilty of harming her child, then the absence of these injuries when Ben was first brought in would be more plausible. The injuries may have developed or become more severe over time, potentially due to natural causes or complications, rather than being the result of intentional harm by Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is estimated to be:\n\n80%",
