  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, rather than being caused by Jane. The frequency of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is 1 in 4,000 in the UK, which is a significant occurrence. Additionally, SIDS is more common among boys than girls, which aligns with the case facts. Furthermore, the autopsy findings of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung for the first son, Andy, do not necessarily indicate foul play, as these can be common in natural infant deaths.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death. The evidence presented, including the findings of injuries to the ribs, spinal cord, and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, suggests that the hypoxic damage was likely caused by smothering or other intentional actions, rather than a natural occurrence.\n\nGiven the evidence, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by natural causes, rather than smothering or other violent trauma, is relatively low.\n\nThe evidence provided indicates that the injuries to Ben's body are consistent with smothering or other intentional acts, rather than natural causes. Even though Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a possible explanation, the specific nature of the injuries makes it less likely that they were caused by natural reasons if Jane is not guilty.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by natural causes is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by smothering or other intentional violent trauma is very high.\n\nThe evidence presented, including the specific injuries to Ben's body, strongly suggests that these were the result of intentional actions rather than natural causes. Given that Jane has been charged with two counts of murder of her children, it is highly probable that she is responsible for the injuries that led to their deaths.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were caused by smothering or other intentional violent trauma is 90%.\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low.\n\nWhile these findings may suggest intentional harm, the evidence also indicates that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 4,000 infants in the UK. Additionally, SIDS is more common among boys, which aligns with the case facts. These injuries could potentially be explained by natural causes or factors unrelated to intentional abuse, if Jane is not the perpetrator.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found in the re-examination of Andy's death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is 40%.\n\n40%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the similarities between the two incidents is relatively high.\n\nThe evidence provided indicates that both babies were about the same age when they died, died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. These similarities could be explained by natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is more common among young infants and can occur without clear explanation.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the similarities between the two incidents are due to natural causes is 80%.\n\n80%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively likely.\n\nThe lack of these additional injuries does not necessarily rule out smothering as the cause of death, as the presence of petechiae and other signs can vary in individual cases. Additionally, the autopsy findings of hypoxic damage to the brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are still consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxiation.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is due to natural causes or other factors unrelated to intentional smothering is 70%.\n\n70%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is relatively unlikely.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the hemorrhages to his eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxiation. The lack of additional injuries like petechiae would be unexpected if Jane intentionally caused Ben's death through smothering.\n\nGiven that Jane has been charged with two counts of murder, the absence of these typical smothering injuries in Ben's case is more likely to be explained by other factors, such as variation in individual responses, rather than a lack of intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is due to factors other than intentional smothering is 30%.\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with attempts to revive him is relatively high.\n\nThe evidence indicates that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung found during the re-examination of Andy's death were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts. This is a plausible explanation, as such injuries are commonly associated with the efforts to revive a baby, especially one who has suffered a sudden and unexpected death.\n\nGiven that Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were caused by the resuscitation attempts and not by intentional harm is 80%.\n\n80%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were due to natural causes or resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and the dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or as a result of the resuscitation efforts. These injuries do not necessarily point to intentional harm if Jane is not the perpetrator.\n\nGiven the context that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a significant factor, and the possibility of natural causes or unintentional injuries from resuscitation, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben were not due to intentional harm is 80%.\n\n80%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively high.\n\nThe fact that the injuries, such as the hypoxic damage to the brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, were not noted by the nurses when Ben was first brought to the hospital suggests that they may have developed or become more severe later on. This would be more consistent with a scenario where Jane is not responsible for Ben's death.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is 80%.\n\n80%",

  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented in the case, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murders of her two children, Andy and Ben, is 80%.\n\n80%",
