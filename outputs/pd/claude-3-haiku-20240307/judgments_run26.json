  "If Jane is not guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in the case of her first son, Andy, is highly unlikely. These findings are characteristic of smothering and are strong indicators of abuse.\n\nIn the context of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), such physical findings are not typically observed. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is only applied after other potential causes of death have been ruled out.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that these physical findings would be present in a case of SIDS, where Jane is not guilty, is very low.\n\n25%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the presence of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in the case of her first son, Andy, is highly likely.\n\nThese physical findings are characteristic of smothering and are strong indicators of abuse. They are consistent with the prosecution's allegation that Jane deliberately smothered both of her children, resulting in their deaths.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty, the probability of observing these physical findings in the case of her first son, Andy, is:\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low.\n\nThese findings are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma, which would be highly unlikely in a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and these types of physical injuries are not typically associated with it.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of observing the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of observing the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high.\n\nThese findings are characteristic of smothering and/or other violent trauma, which would be consistent with the prosecution's allegation that Jane deliberately caused the deaths of her two children.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of observing the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nIn the context of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the underlying cause of death is often not immediately apparent, and the physiological changes leading to death may occur over a longer period of time. Rapid onset of severe hypoxic damage to the brain within a few hours would be an unusual finding in a SIDS case.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage was caused just hours before Ben's death is consistent with the prosecution's claim that Jane deliberately smothered or otherwise caused harm to her son, resulting in his death. Rapid onset of severe brain damage would be expected in a case of intentional asphyxiation or other violent trauma.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being such striking similarities between the two incidents is relatively low.\n\nThe similarities you described, including the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, would be highly unusual coincidences in the context of two separate incidents of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nGiven the rarity of SIDS and the improbability of such a close alignment of circumstances in two separate cases, the probability of these similarities occurring if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of there being such similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe striking parallels you described, including the babies' ages, time of day, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, would be highly consistent with a pattern of intentional, premeditated actions by Jane. These similarities suggest a modus operandi that would be expected if Jane were guilty of deliberately smothering or harming both of her children.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities between the two incidents is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\nIn the case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the lack of observable injuries at the time the child is transported to the hospital would be expected. SIDS is characterized by the sudden and unexplained death of an infant, without any clear signs of trauma or abuse.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nIf Jane had intentionally harmed or smothered her son Ben, resulting in the injuries discovered during the autopsy, it would be expected that at least some of those injuries would have been visible or noted by the medical staff when Ben was first brought to the hospital. The lack of observable injuries at that time would be less likely if Jane were guilty of causing harm to her child.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is highly likely.\n\nIn the context of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the lack of distinctive signs of asphyxiation or smothering, like petechiae, would be expected. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the cause of death is often not immediately apparent or associated with clear physical indicators of trauma.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the absence of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, in Ben's case is unlikely.\n\nIf Jane had intentionally smothered or caused harm to her son Ben, leading to his death, the lack of distinctive signs of asphyxiation or trauma, like petechiae, would be unexpected. Petechiae are commonly associated with deaths due to smothering or other forms of asphyxiation.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries like petechiae in Ben's case is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs were likely the result of post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts. These findings would not be inconsistent with a case of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), where no clear cause of death is identified.\n\nGiven the context, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is moderately likely.\n\nWhile the spinal bleeding may be a common finding in natural deaths, and the dislocated ribs could be attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, the presence of these injuries does not necessarily rule out the possibility of intentional harm by Jane. If she is guilty of smothering or otherwise causing harm to her son Ben, these injuries could still be consistent with the prosecution's allegations.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's case were initially attributed to the resuscitation efforts. Injuries of this nature are commonly associated with the physical manipulation and compressions performed during attempts to revive an infant, especially one experiencing a sudden and unexpected medical emergency.\n\nGiven the context, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe information provided indicates that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's case were later re-evaluated and determined to be indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering. If Jane is guilty of intentionally harming her son Andy, these injuries would be more likely to have been caused by her actions rather than being the result of resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the context, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the evidence presented, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
