  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively low. The medical evidence suggests that the injuries to Ben, including the hypoxic damage, were likely the result of intentional smothering or suffocation, rather than natural causes.\n\nWithout a clear alternate explanation for the injuries, the probability that the hypoxic damage was caused just before Ben's death is quite low, as it would be an unusual and unlikely scenario.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is not guilty, is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high.\n\nThe medical evidence, including the injuries to Ben's ribs, spinal cord, and internal bleeding, suggests that the hypoxic damage was likely the result of intentional smothering or suffocation by Jane, rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the nature of the injuries and the timeline of events, it is highly probable that Jane caused the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain just prior to his death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, if Jane is guilty, is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is quite high.\n\nThe similarities you've described, such as the babies being around the same age, dying at similar times of day, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them, could potentially be explained by natural causes, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nSIDS is a phenomenon that can affect infants of similar ages and often occurs without a clear cause. The timing and circumstances surrounding the deaths could be coincidental.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents would occur is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between the two incidents is very high.\n\nThe striking similarities in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, such as the age of the babies, the time of day, and Jane being alone with them when they were found unconscious, suggest a pattern of behavior rather than mere coincidence.\n\nGiven the medical evidence pointing to intentional smothering or suffocation in the case of Ben's death, it is highly probable that Jane acted in a similar manner with her first son, Andy, even though the initial autopsy suggested natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that these similarities between the two incidents would occur is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is relatively low.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, these medical findings could potentially be explained by other natural causes or accidents, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or an unintentional incident.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is very high.\n\nThe medical evidence, including the specific injuries found during the autopsy, strongly suggests that Ben's death was the result of intentional harm, such as smothering or suffocation, rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the nature of the injuries and the circumstances surrounding Ben's death, it is highly probable that Jane was responsible for causing the hypoxic damage and the haemorrhages that led to his death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering or other violent trauma is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is relatively low.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, these medical findings could potentially be explained by other natural causes or accidental injuries, such as those sometimes seen in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is very high.\n\nThe medical evidence, including the specific injuries found during the re-examination of Andy's autopsy, strongly suggests that his death was the result of intentional harm, such as smothering or suffocation, rather than natural causes.\n\nGiven the similarities between the circumstances surrounding Andy's and Ben's deaths, as well as the consistent pattern of injuries, it is highly probable that Jane was responsible for causing the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung that led to Andy's death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and the blood in the lung in Andy's case are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is quite high.\n\nThe fact that the medical staff did not note the injuries, such as the hypoxic damage to the brain and the hemorrhages, suggests that they may have developed or worsened after Ben was admitted to the hospital.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, it is plausible that these injuries could have occurred due to natural causes or an unintentional incident, and were not visible or detected by the medical staff initially.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low.\n\nGiven the medical evidence pointing to intentional harm, such as the hypoxic damage to the brain and the hemorrhages, it is highly probable that these injuries were present when Ben was admitted to the hospital, but were not detected or properly documented by the medical staff at that time.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of causing these injuries, it is unlikely that they would have developed or worsened significantly after Ben's admission, as the evidence suggests they were the result of smothering or other violent trauma that occurred prior to his arrival at the hospital.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case are consistent with natural death or resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe medical examiner's assertion that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural infant deaths, and that the rib dislocations could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation efforts, provides a plausible explanation for these injuries that does not necessarily point to intentional harm.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional smothering or other abuse, it is reasonable to conclude that these particular injuries could have resulted from natural causes or the attempts to revive Ben, rather than being an indication of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's case are consistent with natural death or resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the other evidence pointing to intentional harm, such as the hypoxic damage to the brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, it is more probable that the spinal bleeding and rib dislocations were also the result of the same intentional actions, such as smothering or other violent trauma, rather than natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nIf Jane is indeed guilty of causing Ben's death, it is less likely that these specific injuries would be explainable by alternative, non-criminal scenarios.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is quite high.\n\nThe lack of typical injuries associated with smothering, like petechiae, provides some evidence that Ben's death may not have been caused by intentional suffocation or smothering. The presence of these types of injuries would be expected if smothering was the cause of death.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, the absence of petechiae and other characteristic smothering injuries suggests that Ben's death could have been due to natural causes or an accidental incident, rather than being the result of deliberate actions by Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben's case is relatively low.\n\nThe medical evidence, including the hypoxic damage to the brain and the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, strongly suggests that Ben's death was the result of intentional smothering or suffocation. The lack of typical smothering injuries, like petechiae, is therefore somewhat unusual and less likely if Jane is indeed guilty.\n\nIt is possible that the specific circumstances or method of smothering used by Jane did not result in the development of petechiae, or that they were simply not detected during the autopsy. However, the overall pattern of injuries is more consistent with intentional harm than natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high.\n\nThe initial assessment that the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung were due to the resuscitation efforts made to revive Andy provides a plausible explanation for these injuries, especially given that they were found in a young infant.\n\nWithout clear evidence of intentional harm, it is reasonable to conclude that these injuries were likely the result of the medical professionals' attempts to resuscitate Andy, rather than being indicative of abuse by Jane.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nGiven the similarities between the circumstances surrounding Andy's and Ben's deaths, as well as the consistent pattern of injuries found in both cases, it is more probable that the injuries to Andy were also the result of intentional harm, such as smothering or suffocation, rather than solely due to resuscitation efforts.\n\nIf Jane is indeed guilty of causing Ben's death through intentional means, it is less likely that the injuries found in Andy's case can be fully explained by the resuscitation attempts alone. The overall evidence suggests a concerning pattern of behavior that extends to both children.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy are consistent with resuscitation attempts is:\n\n30%",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "Based on the analysis of the evidence provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
