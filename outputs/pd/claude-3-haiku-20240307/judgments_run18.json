  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is relatively low. The probability of two sudden infant deaths occurring in the same family within a short time span is extremely rare, with the incidence of SIDS being only 1 in 4,000 in the UK.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of the injuries found in the second child (Ben) and the subsequent findings from the re-examination of the first child's (Andy) autopsy photographs suggest a more sinister cause of death than SIDS.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these similarities would occur if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents is very high. The fact that both babies died under similar circumstances, with Jane being the sole caregiver at the time, strongly suggests a deliberate and calculated action on her part.\n\nThe presence of injuries in the second child (Ben) and the subsequent findings from the re-examination of the first child's (Andy) autopsy photographs further support the hypothesis that Jane intentionally caused the deaths of both children.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these similarities would occur if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is relatively low. These findings are characteristic of abuse and smothering, which would be highly unlikely if the cause of death was truly SIDS.\n\nThe presence of these injuries suggests a more sinister cause of death than natural causes, and would be more consistent with intentional harm to the infant.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these injuries would be present if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n10%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's case is very high. These findings are characteristic of abuse and smothering, which would be consistent with intentional harm to the infant.\n\nThe presence of these injuries, coupled with the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, strongly suggests that Jane deliberately caused the deaths of her two sons.\n\nTherefore, the probability that these injuries would be present if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is relatively high. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) can result in hypoxic brain damage, and this type of injury is not necessarily indicative of intentional harm.\n\nWithout clear evidence of foul play, the hypoxic damage could have been the result of a sudden, unexpected, and unexplained medical event, which is consistent with the definition of SIDS.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very high. The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage must have been caused shortly before Ben's death is consistent with the hypothesis that Jane intentionally caused harm to her son.\n\nThe presence of injuries, along with the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, strongly suggests that Jane deliberately asphyxiated or smothered Ben, leading to the hypoxic damage and his eventual death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is relatively low. These findings are highly consistent with smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be very unlikely in a case of natural Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n\nThe presence of these specific injuries suggests a deliberate act of harm, rather than a sudden, unexplained medical event. If Jane is truly not guilty, these findings would be highly atypical and inconsistent with a SIDS-related death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be present if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n10%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids is very high. These findings are highly characteristic of smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be consistent with Jane intentionally causing harm to her son.\n\nThe presence of these specific injuries, along with the other evidence suggesting foul play, strongly indicates that Jane deliberately asphyxiated or subjected Ben to violent trauma, leading to his death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would be present if Jane is guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively high. Petechiae are a common indicator of smothering or suffocation, but their absence does not necessarily rule out SIDS as the cause of death.\n\nIn some cases of SIDS, no visible external injuries may be present, even though the infant has died due to natural causes. The lack of petechiae or other typical smothering injuries does not automatically implicate Jane in the death of her son.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben would be present if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is relatively low. Petechiae are a common indicator of smothering or suffocation, and their absence in a case where other injuries consistent with asphyxiation are present is somewhat unexpected.\n\nThe lack of petechiae, despite the presence of hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, may suggest that Jane employed a method of smothering that did not produce the typical external signs of petechiae. This could indicate a more calculated or sophisticated approach to causing Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben would be present if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is relatively high. The medical examiner's assessment that the spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs were likely due to post-mortem changes or resuscitation attempts, suggests these injuries are not necessarily indicative of foul play.\n\nIn a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a natural and unexplained death, these types of injuries could plausibly occur without any intentional harm being caused by the caregiver.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs were found in Ben is moderate. The medical examiner's assessment that these injuries are common in natural deaths and could be attributed to resuscitation attempts suggests that their presence is not necessarily indicative of intentional harm.\n\nHowever, given the other evidence suggesting foul play, such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs may have been the result of Jane's actions, even if they are not typically associated with smothering or other violent trauma.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs would be found in Ben if Jane is guilty is:\n\n60%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is very high. In a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), where the death is sudden and unexplained, it is plausible that the injuries observed during the autopsy were not visible or detected by the medical staff at the time of the emergency.\n\nThe lack of visible injuries noted by the nurses suggests that the injuries, such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, may have developed or worsened after the initial medical intervention, rather than being present beforehand.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is relatively low. If Jane had intentionally harmed or smothered her son, it is unlikely that the medical staff would have missed the clear signs of trauma and injury, such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, upon their initial assessment.\n\nThe fact that the injuries were only discovered during the subsequent autopsy suggests that Jane may have taken steps to conceal or minimize the visible signs of her actions, in an attempt to avoid detection. This would be consistent with a deliberate attempt to cover up the true cause of Ben's death.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is guilty is:\n\n30%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is relatively high. The medical examiner's assessment that the injuries, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are consistent with resuscitation attempts is plausible in a case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n\nIn a situation where the baby's death is sudden and unexplained, the injuries observed during the initial autopsy could reasonably be attributed to the emergency medical procedures carried out to try and revive the child. If Jane is truly not guilty, these injuries would not be indicative of any intentional harm.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy would be present if Jane is not guilty is:\n\n80%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy is moderately high. While the medical examiner initially attributed the injuries, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, to the resuscitation attempts, the re-examination of the autopsy photographs suggests a more sinister cause.\n\nThe presence of these injuries, which are characteristic of abuse and smothering, coupled with the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, makes it more likely that Jane intentionally caused harm to Andy, leading to his death. The injuries may not have been fully evident or recognized during the initial investigation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the injuries found in Andy would be present if Jane is guilty is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the cumulative evidence presented, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murder of her two children is:\n\n70%",
  "Based on the probability assessment of 70% that the defendant is guilty, my verdict is:\n\nGUILTY"
