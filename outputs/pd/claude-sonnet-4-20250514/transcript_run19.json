Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Smothering can sometimes occur without leaving classic markers if:\n   - The method is gentle but prolonged\n   - Soft materials are used that don't create intense pressure\n   - The victim is very young with delicate skin\n   - Death occurs relatively quickly\n\n6. However, the absence of these typical indicators when other evidence (hypoxic damage, eye hemorrhages) is present is somewhat inconsistent\n\n7. Most smothering cases do produce petechiae, so their absence reduces the likelihood that typical violent smothering occurred\n\n8. This could suggest either:\n   - Jane is not guilty, or\n   - An atypical smothering method was used\n\nIf Jane were guilty of smothering, the absence of petechiae and other typical smothering injuries would be somewhat unlikely, though not impossible.\n\n25"
