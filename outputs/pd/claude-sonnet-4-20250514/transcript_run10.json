Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both were found by Jane when she was alone with them\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, these would be coincidences in two separate SIDS cases.\n\nFor the similarities:\n\n1. Age similarity: SIDS has a peak incidence between 2-4 months, with many cases occurring in the 6-12 week range. Deaths occurring within a few weeks of each other in this age range is not extremely unusual for SIDS cases.\n\n2. Time of day and post-feeding: SIDS often occurs during sleep periods, and many infants sleep after feeding. This timing is actually quite common for SIDS cases.\n\n3. Found by the same parent when alone: Given that Jane appears to be the primary caregiver (as is common), and that SIDS typically occurs during sleep/quiet times when one parent might be alone with the child, this similarity is less remarkable than it might initially appear.\n\nHowever, the combination of ALL these specific similarities occurring in two separate natural deaths within the same family is much less likely than each individual similarity.\n\nThe base rate of two SIDS deaths in one family is already very low (approximately 1 in 16 million), and adding these specific behavioral and circumstantial similarities makes it considerably less probable.\n\n25"
