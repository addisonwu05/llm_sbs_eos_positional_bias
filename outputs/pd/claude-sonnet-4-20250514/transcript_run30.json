Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both babies were about the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks)\n2. Both died at similar times of day after being fed\n3. Both were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, these would be coincidental similarities in two separate SIDS cases.\n\nFor the age similarity: SIDS has a peak incidence between 1-4 months, so deaths at 8-11 weeks would fall within the typical age range. This similarity is somewhat expected given the SIDS risk profile.\n\nFor the timing (after feeding, similar time of day): SIDS deaths often occur during sleep periods, which frequently follow feeding times. This pattern is not uncommon in SIDS cases.\n\nFor Jane being alone: As the primary caregiver (typical in many families), Jane would statistically be more likely to discover either child in distress, whether from natural or unnatural causes.\n\nWhile these similarities might seem striking, they fall within patterns that could reasonably occur in genuine SIDS cases. The age range, post-feeding timing, and discovery by the primary caregiver are not outside the bounds of what might be expected in natural infant deaths.\n\nHowever, the combination of all these factors occurring twice does reduce the probability somewhat.\n\n75"
