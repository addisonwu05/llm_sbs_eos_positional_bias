  "Given the findings of bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in the re-examination of Andy's death, the likelihood of these specific injuries occurring naturally and not as a result of abuse or smothering is very low. Therefore, if Jane is found not guilty, the probability of these injuries occurring naturally in Andy is estimated to be less than 5 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy being a result of abuse or smothering would be extremely high. Therefore, if Jane is found guilty, the probability of these injuries being present due to the actions of Jane is estimated to be over 95 out of 100.",
  "Given that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and other violent trauma, if Jane is found not guilty, it is highly improbable for these specific injuries to have occurred naturally in Ben. Therefore, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring naturally, if Jane is not guilty, is estimated to be less than 5 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids being the result of smothering or another form of violent trauma would be very high. Therefore, if Jane is found guilty, the probability of these injuries being present due to the actions of Jane is estimated to be over 95 out of 100. ",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the probability that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is very low. In the absence of guilt, it is unlikely that such damage could have occurred shortly before Ben's death. Therefore, the likelihood of this scenario is estimated to be less than 10 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death is quite high. Considering the circumstances and the presence of abusive injuries, it is probable that the damage occurred close to the time of Ben's death. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the hypoxic damage being caused a matter of hours before death is estimated to be over 80 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the probability of there being such striking similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being about the same age, dying at a similar time of the day after being fed, and Jane finding them unconscious when she was alone with them, is very low. In the absence of guilt, it is unlikely for these precise similarities to occur in both cases. Therefore, the likelihood of these similarities existing between both incidents, if Jane is not guilty, is estimated to be less than 10 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood of there being these striking similarities between both incidents, such as the babies being about the same age, dying at a similar time of the day after being fed, and Jane finding them unconscious when she was alone with them, is very high. Given the circumstances and the nature of the incidents, it is probable that these similarities are not mere coincidences. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities existing between both incidents is estimated to be over 90 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben as a result of natural causes or post-mortem occurrences is higher. In the absence of guilt, it is possible that these findings could be unrelated to any deliberate harm. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being present in Ben is estimated to be around 40 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben as a result of intentional harm or abuse is higher. Given the context of the case and the presence of other abusive injuries, it is probable that these findings are linked to harm inflicted by Jane. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being present in Ben is estimated to be over 70 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, despite the presence of other injuries, is reasonable. In cases where smothering is not involved, the absence of certain typical injuries like petechiae is plausible. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be around 60 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben despite the presence of other injuries is lower. In cases where intentional harm or smothering is involved, the presence of petechiae is more common. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is estimated to be around 20 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is significant. In cases where there is no evidence of intentional harm or abuse, the possibility of injuries being missed or not visible at the time of initial examination is plausible. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital is estimated to be around 80 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is lower. In cases where intentional harm or abuse is involved, it is less likely for such injuries to go unnoticed or undocumented upon examination. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries not being present when Ben was brought to the hospital is estimated to be around 30 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found not guilty, the probability that the injuries found in Andy were indeed a result of resuscitation attempts, as initially noted, is significant. In cases where there is no evidence of intentional harm, injuries consistent with resuscitation efforts are plausible, especially in the context of attempting to revive a baby. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being related to resuscitation attempts is estimated to be around 70 out of 100.",
  "If Jane is found guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found in Andy were not solely due to resuscitation attempts but rather indicative of abuse or harm is higher. In cases where intentional harm or abuse is involved, the presence of injuries beyond what would be expected from resuscitation can suggest foul play. Therefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of the injuries found in Andy being related to abuse or harm is estimated to be around 80 out of 100.",
  "Based on the evidence presented, the probability that the defendant is guilty appears to be high.\n\nProbability of guilt: 90 out of 100.",
  "Guilty."
