  "Based on the findings of the re-examination of Andy's autopsy, which revealed bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, the likelihood of these injuries occurring in the absence of abuse or smothering is very low. It is highly unlikely that these specific injuries would occur naturally or due to other causes. Therefore, considering the evidence presented, the probability of these injuries occurring in Andy without abuse or smothering is **5**.",
  "If Jane is found guilty of smothering both Andy and Ben, the likelihood of the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely high. These injuries are characteristic of abuse and smothering, and in the context of the evidence presented, it is highly probable that Jane inflicted these injuries on Andy. Considering the circumstances and the findings from the re-examination, the probability of these injuries occurring in Andy due to abuse or smothering is **95**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, the likelihood of these striking similarities between both incidents - the babies being about the same age when they died, both dying at a similar time of the day after being fed, and being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them - occurring purely by coincidence is very low. These similarities suggest a pattern or deliberate action rather than random chance. Considering the circumstances and the alignment of these details, the probability of these similarities occurring between both incidents by chance is **10**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents - such as the babies being around the same age when they died, both passing away at a similar time of the day after being fed, and being discovered unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them - would be very high. These consistencies indicate a deliberate pattern of behavior, where Jane may have intentionally orchestrated these circumstances in both cases. Considering the evidence and the aligned details, the probability of these similarities occurring between both incidents if Jane is guilty is **90**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, which are consistent with smothering and violent trauma, would be unexpected. These specific injuries are typically associated with physical harm inflicted intentionally rather than occurring naturally. Given the nature of these injuries and their correlation with abusive actions, the probability of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids occurring in the absence of abuse or violence is very low. Therefore, the likelihood of these injuries in Ben without abuse is **5**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, the presence of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids would strongly support the notion of smothering and violent trauma being inflicted upon him. These specific injuries are consistent with deliberate actions resulting in harm to the child. Given the context of Jane's guilt and the nature of these injuries, the likelihood of hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids if Jane is guilty is very high. Therefore, the probability of these injuries in Ben due to abuse or violence is **95**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, and considering the allegation by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, the likelihood of this specific timeline being accurate in the absence of guilt is uncertain. In cases of sudden infant death or other natural causes, establishing a precise timeframe for brain damage can be challenging. Without evidence of intentional harm or abuse, the exact timing of such damage may remain unclear. Therefore, the probability of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death without Jane's involvement is **50**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, and considering the allegation by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death, the probability of this specific timeline being accurate is very high. In cases where intentional harm or violence is involved, the timing of such damage is typically more ascertainable due to the nature of the actions leading to it. Given the context of Jane's guilt and the doctor's assessment, the likelihood of the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death if Jane is guilty is **90**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, and considering that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, the likelihood of these injuries not being present at the time of arrival to the hospital is uncertain. In cases where injuries are not immediately observed or documented, there can be various reasons behind this occurrence, including the possibility of injuries becoming more apparent or manifesting later. Without evidence of guilt or intentional harm, it is challenging to definitively determine the timing or presence of such injuries. Therefore, the probability of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital without Jane's involvement is **50**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, and considering that the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital, the probability of these injuries not being present when he was initially brought in is low. In cases where intentional harm or violence is involved, injuries may not always be immediately apparent or documented, especially if they develop over time or are not in clear view. Given the context of Jane's guilt and the nature of the injuries discovered later, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital if Jane is guilty is **20**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, and considering that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, it is important to acknowledge that injuries consistent with resuscitation efforts can indeed occur during lifesaving procedures, particularly with babies. These injuries are often a result of the necessary actions taken to revive a person and may not necessarily indicate foul play. In the absence of guilt, it is plausible that the injuries found in Andy could be solely attributed to resuscitation. Therefore, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy if Jane is not guilty is **70**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, and considering the possibility of intentional harm or abuse, the likelihood of the injuries found in Andy being solely a result of resuscitation attempts is low. While resuscitation efforts can lead to injuries, the specific nature and extent of the injuries found in Andy may point towards a different cause, such as smothering or violent trauma. Given the context of Jane's guilt and the nature of the injuries, the probability of the injuries in Andy being solely due to resuscitation if Jane is guilty is **30**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, and considering that no other typical injuries of death due to smothering were found on Ben, including the absence of petechiae, it is important to note that the presence or absence of specific signs can vary in different cases of infant death. While petechiae can sometimes be present in cases of smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out other causes of death. Therefore, in the absence of evidence pointing towards guilt, the likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is higher and can be attributed to a different cause. The probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is not guilty is **75**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, and considering the presence of injuries indicative of abusive behavior, the absence of typical injuries of death due to smothering, such as petechiae, on Ben may suggest variations in the manifestation of signs of smothering. While petechiae can be a common finding in cases of smothering, their absence does not definitively rule out other forms of harm or abuse. Given the complexity of such cases and the potential for variations in injury patterns, especially with different individuals, the probability of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben if Jane is guilty is lower. The likelihood of this absence in the context of Jane's guilt is **40**.",
  "If Jane is not guilty of the murder of both children, and considering that spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs are common findings in natural death or may occur post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, the likelihood of these specific conditions being identified in Ben without Jane's involvement is plausible. Given the potential for these findings to be attributed to factors other than deliberate harm or abuse, the probability of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben if Jane is not guilty is **70**.",
  "If Jane is guilty of the murder of both children, and considering the presence of injuries consistent with abuse and intentional harm, the likelihood of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being found in Ben increases. While these findings can potentially have other explanations, in the context of Jane's guilt and the patterns observed in the case, the probability of the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being present in Ben if Jane is guilty is **80**.",
  "Based on the provided evidence, which includes injuries consistent with abuse, deliberate harm, and patterns suggestive of foul play, the probability that the defendant is guilty is high. Considering the multiple instances of suspicious circumstances surrounding the deaths of both children, as well as the presence of injuries not easily explained by natural causes, the likelihood of guilt in this case is **90**.",
