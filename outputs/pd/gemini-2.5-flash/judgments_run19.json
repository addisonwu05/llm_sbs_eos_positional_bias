  "The problem states that \"The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means Andy was not murdered by smothering. Therefore, the cause of death would be something else, such as SIDS or another natural/accidental cause (as the initial post-mortem suggested \"natural causes\").\n\nThe question asks for the likelihood of these specific findings *if Jane is not guilty of smothering*.\nSince these findings are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" their presence in a case where smothering *did not* occur would be highly improbable. If these findings were common in natural deaths (like SIDS) or accidental deaths, they would not be considered \"characteristic of smothering\" or \"indicative of abuse\" in a forensic context, as they would lack specificity.\n\nTherefore, for these findings to be present *if* Jane is not guilty (i.e., if smothering did not happen), it would imply an extremely rare occurrence of such a constellation of injuries from other, non-abusive causes that coincidentally mimic smothering. Given that these findings led to a murder charge, they are considered to have high diagnostic value for smothering.\n\nConsequently, the probability of these specific findings occurring in an infant who was *not* smothered is very low.\n\n1",

  "0dæ P(G | E) = P(E | G) * P(G) / (P(E | G) * P(G) + P(E | ~G) * P(~G))\n\nSince the LRs are so extreme, and multiple pieces of independent-ish evidence show very high LRs, the posterior probability of guilt will be very high, even starting from a low prior.\n\nLet's use a conservative approach, assuming some correlation between the injuries.\nThe most damning evidence for Jane's guilt is the presence of injuries characteristic of smothering in Andy (re-examination finding) AND the presence of injuries consistent with smothering/violent trauma in Ben, particularly hypoxic damage and ocular haemorrhages. These findings each have a 1% chance of occurring if Jane is innocent. The combined chance of two such independent rare events occurring if Jane is innocent would be 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001 (0.01%).\nFurthermore, the similarities between the incidents (age, time, Jane alone) are also much more likely if Jane is guilty (90%) than if innocent (15%). This further reduces the probability of innocence.\nThe doctor's allegation about Ben's hypoxic damage occurring hours before death also strongly points to an acute event (smothering) rather than a natural, potentially more prolonged, process (P(~G)=5% vs P(G)=95%).\n\nThe main counter-evidence is the absence of petechiae in Ben (P(E5|G)=25% vs P(E5|~G)=90%). This is a significant point, as it makes smothering less likely for Ben compared to a scenario where petechiae *were* present. However, it does not make smothering impossible (25% is not 0%).\n\nConsidering all the evidence:\n*   The fact that characteristic abuse/smothering injuries were identified in *both* children through detailed examination, and these are extremely rare in natural death (P=1%), provides a very strong foundation for guilt.\n*   The striking similarities between the two death events, making two natural deaths highly improbable by chance.\n*   The specific timing of Ben's brain damage.\n*   The overall statistical improbability of two SIDS deaths in the same family (1/16,000,000), even if SIDS doesn't perfectly explain the specific injuries.\n\nThe absence of petechiae is a mitigating factor, but it's outweighed by the multiple, strong positive indicators of abuse. A 25% chance of absence if guilty means it happens in 1 out of 4 cases of smothering. This isn't enough to overcome the 95% likelihood of the other severe findings.\n\nGiven the cumulative weight of evidence, especially the recurrence of highly specific injuries and circumstantial patterns in *two* children, the probability of Jane being guilty appears very high.\n\nI need to output a single integer from 0-100.\nThe LRs for guilt are overwhelmingly high.\nP(G) is unknown. Let's assume a \"neutral\" prior like 0.5 (though in reality, it would be much lower for a parent murdering their children).\nIf P(G) = 0.5, then P(~G) = 0.5.\nPosterior Odds = Prior Odds * LR\nPrior Odds = P(G) / P(~G) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1\nPosterior Odds = 1 * 285970 = 285970\nP(G|E) = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 285970 / 285971 ≈ 0.9999965\n\nEven if the prior P(G) is very low, say 1 in 1,000,000 (0.000001), representing the rarity of such crimes.\nP(G) = 0.000001\nP(~G) = 0.999999\nPrior Odds = 0.000001 / 0.999999 ≈ 0.000001\nPosterior Odds = 0.000001 * 285970 ≈ 0.28597\nP(G|E) = 0.28597 / (1 + 0.28597) = 0.28597 / 1.28597 ≈ 0.222\n\nThis calculation seems too low, given how strong the individual LRs are. The \"independence\" assumption might be too simplistic, or my estimation of the combined LR.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the impact of the *double occurrence* of highly unlikely events under the innocence hypothesis.\nP(E1 | ~G) = 0.01\nP(E3 | ~G) = 0.01\nP(E_sim | ~G) = 0.15\nP(E4 | ~G) = 0.05\n\nIf we consider just these four pieces of evidence against the ~G hypothesis, assuming they are somewhat independent:\nP(E1 AND E3 AND E_sim AND E4 | ~G) = 0.01 * 0.01 * 0.15 * 0.05 = 0.00000075\n\nNow for the G hypothesis:\nP(E1 | G) = 0.95\nP(E3 | G) = 0.95\nP(E_sim | G) = 0.90\nP(E4 | G) = 0.95\nP(E1 AND E3 AND E_sim AND E4 | G) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.90 * 0.95 = 0.771\n\nNow, let's incorporate E5 (absence of petechiae) for Ben:\nP(E5 | G) = 0.25\nP(E5 | ~G) = 0.90\n\nRecalculating P(E | G) and P(E | ~G) more comprehensively.\nLet E_fav_G be the set of evidence that strongly favors guilt (E1, E3, E4, E_sim).\nLet E_fav_~G be the evidence that strongly favors innocence (E5).\nLet E_neutral be the evidence that is roughly neutral (E2, E6, E7).\n\nP(E_fav_G | G) = 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.90 = 0.771\nP(E_fav_G | ~G) = 0.01 * 0.01 * 0.05 * 0.15 = 0.00000075\n\nP(E_fav_~G | G) = 0.25\nP(E_fav_~G | ~G) = 0.90\n\nP(E_neutral | G) = 0.95 * 0.80 * 0.75 = 0.57\nP(E_neutral | ~G) = 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.614\n\nCombining them (still assuming independence, which is the weakest link here, but gives a sense of scale):\nP(E | G) = P(E_fav_G | G) * P(E_fav_~G | G) * P(E_neutral | G) = 0.771 * 0.25 * 0.57 = 0.1098\nP(E | ~G) = P(E_fav_G | ~G) * P(E_fav_~G | ~G) * P(E_neutral | ~G) = 0.00000075 * 0.90 * 0.614 = 0.000000414\n\nLikelihood Ratio (LR) = P(E | G) / P(E | ~G) = 0.1098 / 0.000000414 ≈ 265217\n\nThis LR is still extremely high.\n\nIf we apply this to a prior P(G) = 1 in 1,000,000 (0.000001):\nP(G|E) = (P(E|G) * P(G)) / (P(E|G) * P(G) + P(E|~G) * P(~G))\nP(G|E) = (0.1098 * 0.000001) / (0.1098 * 0.000001 + 0.000000414 * 0.999999)\nP(G|E) = 0.0000001098 / (0.0000001098 + 0.000000413999586)\nP(G|E) = 0.0000001098 / 0.000000523799586 ≈ 0.2096\n\nStill around 20%. This implies that a very low prior for P(G) (extremely low background rate for filicide) requires *even more* overwhelming evidence to reach high certainty.\n\nHowever, the problem is posed in a way that the previous probability judgments are \"given\" facts about the evidence, not estimations of general probabilities. The *charge* of murder itself implies that the evidence is considered strong by prosecutors.\n\nThe question implicitly asks for the probability *given the provided evidence*. In a legal context, \"guilty\" means \"beyond reasonable doubt\". A 20% probability is far from that.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"base rate\" of SIDS vs. filicide.\nThe occurrence of SIDS is 1/4000. Two SIDS deaths (if independent) would be 1/16,000,000. This is the background probability for the ~G hypothesis for the *deaths themselves*, even before considering the specific injuries.\n\nLet's think about this from a simpler perspective:\nThe evidence points to highly specific injuries characteristic of smothering in *two* separate infants. These injuries are explicitly stated to be very unlikely if Jane is not guilty (1%).\nThe presence of these injuries in two separate instances, combined with the extreme statistical unlikelihood of two natural SIDS deaths, makes the \"not guilty\" scenario extremely improbable.\nThe \"not guilty\" scenario would require *both* children to die of natural causes *and* for the characteristic smothering injuries to appear by freak coincidence in both, *and* for the circumstantial similarities to occur by chance. The probability of P(E|~G) seems astonishingly low.\n\nLet's consider that the previous individual judgments for P(E|~G) are 1%, 1%, 5%, 15%. This makes P(E_fav_G | ~G) very small.\nP(E|G) is generally high, even with the petechiae absence.\n\nThe cumulative evidence is very strong. The likelihood of *all* these damning features existing if Jane is innocent (i.e. both deaths are natural, and these features are freak coincidences) is extremely, extremely small.\n\nLet's consider the interpretation of \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If these",
