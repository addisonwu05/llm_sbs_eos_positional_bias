  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means she did not smother Andy, and his death was due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another unmentioned natural cause.\n\nThe background states that the re-examined findings in Andy (bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nIf these findings are truly characteristic of smothering and abuse, then it would be extremely unlikely for them to occur in a natural death (such as SIDS) where no abuse took place. The very purpose of identifying such findings is to distinguish abusive deaths from natural ones. If they were common in natural deaths, they would not be considered indicative of abuse.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these specific findings being present if Jane is not guilty (i.e., if Andy died of natural causes without abuse) should be very low. It cannot be 0, as there's always a theoretical possibility of rare coincidental injuries or misinterpretation, but the strong medical classification (\"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\") points to a very low probability in the absence of abuse.\n\n1",
