  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, specifically Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) as presented in the case background. This requires us to assume that the significant autopsy findings (injuries to ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage, hemorrhages to eyes and eyelids for Ben; bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung for Andy) are either misinterpreted, naturally occurring, or otherwise not indicative of foul play, as true SIDS is defined as an unexplained death.\n\nUnder the assumption that both deaths were genuinely SIDS and therefore independent natural occurrences, we evaluate the likelihood of the described similarities:\n\n1.  **Both babies about the same age when they died (11 weeks and 8 weeks):** The peak incidence of SIDS is between 2 and 4 months (8 to 16 weeks). Both Andy and Ben fall squarely within this high-risk period. Therefore, it is quite likely for two SIDS deaths to occur within this age range.\n2.  **Both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed:** SIDS is often referred to as \"crib death\" because it typically occurs during sleep, commonly after being fed and put to bed. This similarity is also consistent with the general pattern of SIDS.\n3.  **Both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** This is the most critical and incriminating similarity from a human perspective. If two SIDS deaths occurred independently and randomly, the probability that the same person (Jane) would be alone during the discovery of both incidents is a striking coincidence. While a primary caregiver might often be alone with a baby, for this specific circumstance to repeat across two independent tragic events is highly improbable.\n\nConsidering these three similarities:\n*   The first two similarities (age and time/context) are individually plausible for SIDS deaths.\n*   However, the third similarity (Jane being alone for both discoveries) significantly diminishes the likelihood that these events were independent SIDS deaths. If SIDS is truly random, the chance of the same specific individual being alone on both occasions is a powerful indicator against independence.\n*   The fact that all three similarities align perfectly in both incidents, and the text describes them as \"astonishing,\" points to a very low probability under the hypothesis of two unrelated natural deaths.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning two natural SIDS deaths, despite the contradictory forensic evidence), the cumulative probability of these highly specific and \"astonishing\" similarities occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\n2",

  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that Ben's death was due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and not due to smothering or other inflicted trauma.\n\nHowever, the autopsy discovered \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\" These are described as injuries, and the case background states they are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Furthermore, a doctor alleged that the hypoxic damage \"must have been caused a matter of hours before death.\"\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, then these findings (the \"injuries\") must either:\n1.  Be misinterpreted and not actually indicative of trauma, but rather natural phenomena or artifacts that are consistent with a natural death.\n2.  Have been caused by someone else, or by events that occurred *after* Ben left Jane's care.\n\nThe question asks how likely it is that these injuries *were not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital.\n\n*   **Hypoxic Damage:** The allegation that it \"must have been caused a matter of hours before death\" strongly suggests it was present before Ben was brought to the hospital. If this is true, then this specific injury was present upon arrival.\n*   **Rib and Spinal Cord Injuries:** While rib fractures can sometimes occur during resuscitation attempts (which happen after hospital arrival), spinal cord injuries are highly unlikely to be caused by resuscitation. If they are genuine injuries, they would most likely have been present before hospital arrival.\n*   **Haemorrhages to the Eyes and Eyelids:** These are also highly indicative of trauma or asphyxia and are not typically caused by natural death, post-mortem changes, or standard resuscitation efforts. If they are genuine injuries, they would most likely have been present before hospital arrival.\n\nGiven the nature and extent of these findings, and especially the doctor's specific claim about the timing of the hypoxic damage, it is highly improbable that *all* of these \"injuries\" were *not present* when Ben was brought to the hospital. If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the most plausible scenario for these findings is that they were present when he was brought to the hospital but are either misinterpreted as traumatic injuries, or were caused by natural processes that occurred prior to his arrival (though this is difficult to reconcile with the specific types of injuries described). The idea that they all developed *after* he left Jane's care and before the autopsy, from non-abusive causes, strains credibility.\n\n5",
