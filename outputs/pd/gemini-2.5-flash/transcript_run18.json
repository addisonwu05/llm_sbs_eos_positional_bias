Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that both Andy and Ben died of natural causes, specifically Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as it is the alternative explanation provided. The question asks for the likelihood of the observed similarities *given* that Jane is not guilty (i.e., given two SIDS deaths).\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of each similarity occurring for a single SIDS death, and then combine them for two independent SIDS deaths:\n\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died (Andy 11 weeks, Ben 8 weeks):** SIDS has a peak incidence between 2 and 4 months (8 to 16 weeks). Both ages fall squarely within this peak period. Therefore, if a SIDS death occurs, there's a reasonably high probability it would be within this age range. Let's conservatively estimate this probability as **0.5 (50%)** for a single SIDS death.\n\n2.  **They both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed:** SIDS most commonly occurs during sleep, and infants are often put to bed after feeding. This is a very common scenario for SIDS deaths. Let's conservatively estimate the probability of a SIDS death occurring under these specific circumstances as **0.6 (60%)** for a single SIDS death.\n\n3.  **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** If Jane is the primary caregiver, it's highly probable she would be the one to find the baby if something were wrong. The \"alone\" aspect means no other adult was present at the time of discovery. If Jane is alone with the baby a significant portion of the time (e.g., 50% of the time, especially during sleep periods when SIDS often occurs), then the probability that a SIDS event is discovered by her when she is alone would be approximately **0.5 (50%)**.\n\nAssuming these three characteristics are largely independent given a SIDS death, the probability of a *single* SIDS death exhibiting all these similarities would be:\nP(Similarities | One SIDS) = P(Age | SIDS) × P(Time/Feed | SIDS) × P(Found by Jane alone | SIDS)\nP(Similarities | One SIDS) = 0.5 × 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.15 (15%)\n\nNow, the question is about the likelihood of these similarities occurring in *both* incidents, assuming both were independent SIDS deaths. Therefore, we multiply the probability for one SIDS death by itself:\nP(Similarities for both | Two SIDS) = P(Similarities | One SIDS) × P(Similarities | One SIDS)\nP(Similarities for both | Two SIDS) = 0.15 × 0.15 = 0.0225\n\nThis means there is a 0.0225, or 2.25%, chance that these specific similarities would occur if Jane is not guilty (i.e., if both children died independently of SIDS).\n\nRounding 2.25% to the nearest integer, we get 2. A probability of 2% (1 in 50) is very low and could be described as \"astonishing\" in a legal context, aligning with the description in the problem. It also avoids implying impossibility (a probability of 0).\n\n2"

    "content": "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she intentionally smothered both of her children. In this scenario, the observed similarities are not random coincidences but rather patterns of behavior chosen by the perpetrator, Jane, to facilitate her actions and avoid detection.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of each similarity given Jane's guilt:\n\n1.  **Both babies were about the same age when they died (Andy 11 weeks, Ben 8 weeks):** If a perpetrator is acting, there might be a \"preferred\" or opportune age range where they find the infant most vulnerable, or when their own stress levels peak. The ages of 8 and 11 weeks are very close in infant development. It is highly probable that if Jane committed two such acts, she would do so at similar young ages. Let's assign a probability of **0.90 (90%)**.\n\n2.  **They both died at a similar time of the day after just being fed:** Smothering an infant when they are drowsy after a feed and being put to bed provides an ideal opportunity for a perpetrator to act covertly, minimize struggle, and offer a plausible explanation for the baby's subsequent unresponsiveness. It is highly probable that Jane would repeat this advantageous timing for a second act. Let's assign a probability of **0.95 (95%)**.\n\n3.  **They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them:** For Jane to commit the act of smothering without being observed, she *must* have been alone with the child. Therefore, the fact that she was alone when the incident occurred (and thus when she \"found\" the baby) is a necessary prerequisite for her unobserved guilt. This similarity is virtually certain if she is the perpetrator. Let's assign a probability of **1.00 (100%)**.\n\nAssuming these aspects of her modus operandi are independent given her guilt, we multiply these probabilities:\nP(Similarities | Jane is Guilty) = P(Similar Age | Guilty) × P(Similar Time/Feed | Guilty) × P(Found Alone by Jane | Guilty)\nP(Similarities | Jane is Guilty) = 0.90 × 0.95 × 1.00 = 0.855\n\nRounding this probability to the nearest integer (85.5 rounds up), we get 86.\n\n86"

Dislocated ribs are a known potential consequence of such attempts. Therefore, the likelihood of finding dislocated ribs, given that resuscitation attempts were made, is very high. Let's estimate this probability as **0.90 (90%)**.\n\n2.  **Spinal bleeding:** The statement says this is \"a common finding in natural death.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben's death was *not* a natural death (it was due to smothering). Therefore, the presence of a finding that is \"common in natural death\" would be less expected than if the death were indeed natural. It's not impossible, as it could be an incidental finding, or potentially caused by struggle during smothering, or even aggravated by resuscitation efforts. However, since it is specifically highlighted as \"common in natural death\" rather than being linked to violent trauma, its likelihood in a non-natural death scenario is significantly lower than in a natural death scenario. Let's estimate this as a relatively low probability, for instance, **0.15 (15%)**, representing an incidental or less likely occurrence in an unnatural death compared to a natural one.\n\nTo find the combined likelihood, we multiply these probabilities, assuming they are largely independent given Jane's guilt:\nP(Spinal Bleeding AND Dislocated Ribs | Jane is Guilty) = P(Spinal Bleeding | Guilty) × P(Dislocated Ribs | Guilty)\nP(Spinal Bleeding AND Dislocated Ribs | Jane is Guilty) = 0.15 × 0.90 = 0.135\n\nRounding 0.135 to the nearest integer gives 14.\n\n14"
