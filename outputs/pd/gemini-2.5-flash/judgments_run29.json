  "The question asks for the likelihood of the specific injuries found in Andy (bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) if Jane is NOT GUILTY.\n\nThe prompt explicitly states: \"The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means she did not murder Andy by smothering him. In this scenario, Andy's death would be attributed to natural causes (as initially suggested) or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), as presented in the alternative explanation.\n\nThe key is the statement that these specific injuries are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" This implies that such a combination of injuries is *not* typically found in cases of SIDS or other natural causes of death, and rather points strongly towards the act of smothering/abuse.\n\nTherefore, if smothering did *not* occur (because Jane is not guilty), then the presence of evidence that is \"characteristic of smothering\" would be highly unlikely. If these findings were common or easily explained by SIDS or natural causes, they would not be described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nThus, the probability of observing these injuries if Jane is not guilty should be very low. It is not impossible (as there can always be rare coincidences, misinterpretations, or other unknown factors), but it is presented as a distinguishing feature of smothering.\n\nA low single-digit probability best reflects \"highly unlikely\" but not absolutely impossible.\n\n1",
