  "Based on the evidence and analysis, I would conclude that the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty\n\nThis verdict is based on the cumulative assessment of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of the two children, the presence of injuries indicative of trauma or abuse, and other medical findings. The probability judgment of 85 indicates a high likelihood of guilt, supporting this verdict."
