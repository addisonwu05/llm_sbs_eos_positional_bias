  "Based on the analysis of the given evidence, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe accumulation of evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of the two children, the presence of non-accidental injuries in both, and the consistency of these findings with asphyxiation or significant trauma, strongly suggests that Jane was responsible for their deaths.\n\nWhile there are some uncertainties and alternative explanations, the overall pattern of evidence points towards Jane's guilt. Therefore, my verdict is that Jane is **Guilty**."
