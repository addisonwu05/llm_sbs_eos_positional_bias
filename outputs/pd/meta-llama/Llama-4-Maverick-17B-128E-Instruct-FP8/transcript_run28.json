Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The alternative explanation given is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n\n1. **Understanding the findings**: \n   - **Bruises to the arms and legs**: These could be indicative of trauma. However, infants can sometimes get bruised due to accidental injuries or even during medical procedures or handling.\n   - **Torn frenulum**: This is often considered a sign of potential abuse as it can result from a blow to the mouth or forced feeding. However, it's also possible for a torn frenulum to occur accidentally, though this is less common.\n   - **Blood in the lung**: This could be indicative of significant trauma or other serious conditions.\n\n2. **Relating the findings to SIDS or accidental causes**:\n   - SIDS is diagnosed when the death is sudden and unexplained after thorough investigation, including autopsy. The presence of significant injuries like bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung typically rules out SIDS as these findings suggest that the death might not be entirely unexplained.\n\n3. **Assessing the likelihood if Jane is not guilty**:\n   - If Jane is not guilty, it means we are looking at the scenario where the injuries and death are either due to SIDS or some other accidental or natural cause.\n   - The specific injuries mentioned (bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are not typical of SIDS. SIDS deaths are not usually associated with such significant traumatic findings.\n   - However, it is theoretically possible for an infant to die of SIDS and still have some injuries or signs that could be misinterpreted. The key here is whether these findings are consistent with an accidental or SIDS-related death.\n\n4. **Probability Judgment**:\nGiven that the presence of these injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) is not typical for SIDS and generally indicates some form of trauma or significant event, if Jane is not guilty (implying no intentional harm), the likelihood of these specific findings being present due to other (non-intentional harm) causes is low.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 5"

Both babies were about the same age when they died.\n2. They both died at a similar time of day.\n3. They both died after just being fed.\n4. They were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies that the deaths were not due to her intentional actions (e.g., smothering). In this case, we're considering whether these similarities could occur by coincidence or due to other factors.\n\n1. **Age at death**: SIDS can occur at any age during the first year, but it peaks between 1-4 months. Both Andy and Ben died within this age range (11 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively), which is not uncommon for SIDS cases. The similarity in age could be coincidental given that both were infants and within the age range susceptible to SIDS.\n\n2. **Time of day and feeding**: SIDS can occur at any time. However, there isn't a well-established correlation between SIDS and the time of day relative to feeding. Some research suggests that SIDS might be more common during certain periods, such as the early morning hours, but these patterns are not strongly tied to feeding times.\n\n3. **Being found unconscious by Jane when alone**: This circumstance is more related to the household dynamics and Jane's role as the primary caregiver rather than the cause of death. It's plausible that as the primary caregiver, Jane would be the one to discover both children unresponsive.\n\nTo assess the likelihood of these similarities if Jane is not guilty, we consider that:\n- The age similarity could be somewhat expected given the age range for SIDS.\n- The time of day and relation to feeding might be less directly correlated but could still occur by coincidence.\n- Being alone with the children is a circumstance related to caregiving responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the combination of these specific similarities, while not impossible, becomes less likely under the assumption of natural or accidental deaths (like SIDS), as SIDS deaths are, by definition, unexplained and the circumstances around them can vary widely.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 20"

This could result in similar circumstances around the time of death.\n\n3. **Being found unconscious by Jane when alone**: If Jane is guilty, she would likely be the one to discover the children to fabricate a scenario that avoids suspicion, making it a deliberate action to create a similar narrative for both deaths.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of similarities in the circumstances surrounding the deaths (such as age, time of day relative to feeding, and being found by Jane while alone) increases because:\n- A perpetrator may act in a similar manner or follow a pattern in their actions.\n- The circumstances could be manipulated or chosen to fit a certain narrative or to minimize detection.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of there being these similarities is relatively high because they could be the result of a deliberate and patterned action.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 90"

In the context of Ben's death, it suggests that Ben experienced a period of insufficient oxygenation before death.\n\n2. **Timing of Hypoxic Damage**: The doctor's allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred a matter of hours before death implies that there was a significant event or period of hypoxia relatively close to the time of death.\n\n3. **Implications of Jane's Innocence**: If Jane is not guilty, it means she did not intentionally cause harm or smother Ben. In this scenario, any hypoxic damage would be due to other, non-intentional causes.\n\n4. **Assessing Likelihood**: \n   - If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, the presence of significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typical. SIDS deaths are sudden and unexpected, and while there can be some pathological findings, significant hypoxic damage hours before death is not characteristic of SIDS.\n   - Other natural or accidental causes could potentially result in hypoxic damage, but the timing and context would be crucial in determining the likelihood.\n\nGiven that significant hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not typical for SIDS or most natural causes of infant death, if Jane is not guilty (and thus not responsible for smothering or causing the hypoxic damage intentionally), the likelihood that the hypoxic damage occurred due to natural causes or accident a matter of hours before death is relatively low.\n\nThe probability judgment is: 10"
