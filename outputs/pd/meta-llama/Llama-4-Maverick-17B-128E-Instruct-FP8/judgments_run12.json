  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis of the case, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the similarities in the circumstances of the deaths of Andy and Ben, the presence of significant injuries in both children indicative of non-accidental trauma, and the overall pattern of evidence supports the conclusion that Jane is guilty of causing the deaths of her two sons.\n\nThis verdict is based on a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard, which is the typical threshold for criminal convictions. While there may be some uncertainties and alternative explanations for certain findings, the totality of the evidence presented supports the conclusion that Jane is guilty.\n\nVerdict: **Guilty**"
