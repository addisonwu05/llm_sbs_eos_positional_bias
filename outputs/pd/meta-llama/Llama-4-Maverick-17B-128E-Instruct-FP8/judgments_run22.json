  "Based on the evidence presented and the analysis provided, I would conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty** of the murders of her two children, Andy and Ben.\n\nThe cumulative evidence, including the similarities in the circumstances of both deaths, the presence of significant and non-accidental injuries in both children, and the medical and forensic evidence supporting smothering or significant trauma, collectively points towards Jane's guilt.\n\nWhile there are some alternative explanations for certain findings, the overall pattern and the severity of the evidence presented strongly support the conclusion that Jane is guilty of the charges brought against her."
