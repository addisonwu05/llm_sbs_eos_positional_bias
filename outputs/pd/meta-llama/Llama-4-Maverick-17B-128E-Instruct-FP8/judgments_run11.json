  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**. The cumulative effect of the similarities between the deaths of Andy and Ben, the presence of significant injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma, and the lack of convincing alternative explanations for these findings all support the conclusion that Jane is responsible for the deaths of her two sons."
