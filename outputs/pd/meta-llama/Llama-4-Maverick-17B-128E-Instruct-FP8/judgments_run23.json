  "Based on the analysis of the evidence and the probability judgments provided, I conclude that the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty\n\nThis verdict is based on the preponderance of evidence suggesting that Jane was responsible for the deaths of her two children, Andy and Ben, through smothering or other forms of abuse. The cumulative effect of the similarities in the circumstances of their deaths, the presence of injuries indicative of non-accidental trauma, and other evidence presented, supports this conclusion.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
