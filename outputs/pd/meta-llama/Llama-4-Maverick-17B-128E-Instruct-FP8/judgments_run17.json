  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, I would state that the defendant, Jane, is **Guilty**. This verdict is based on the cumulative weight of the evidence, including the similarities between the deaths of the two children, the presence of injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma, and the medical testimony supporting the possibility of smothering or asphyxia.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the probability judgment provided earlier was 65, indicating a significant but not overwhelming level of certainty. In a real-world legal context, the standard for conviction is typically \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is a higher threshold than a probability judgment of 65.\n\nIn a legal proceeding, the decision to convict would depend on a more detailed evaluation of all the evidence, including any additional evidence not considered here, and would be subject to the legal standards and procedures of the jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the constraints of this hypothetical scenario, the verdict is **Guilty**."
