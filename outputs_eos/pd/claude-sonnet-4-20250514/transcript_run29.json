Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me consider each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Two infant deaths in the same family: While rare, this can occur naturally. SIDS has a rate of 1 in 4,000, so two SIDS deaths in one family, while extremely uncommon, is theoretically possible.\n\n2. Similar circumstances (same age, time of day, after feeding, Jane alone): These similarities could potentially occur by coincidence, as many infant care routines follow similar patterns.\n\n3. Physical evidence in Andy: Bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lung are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These injuries are very difficult to explain through natural causes or SIDS.\n\n4. Physical evidence in Ben: Hypoxic brain damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Again, these findings are not typical of natural infant death.\n\n5. Timing of Ben's brain damage: Occurring \"hours before death\" suggests a specific traumatic event rather than a sudden natural death.\n\nThe combination of two deaths with physical evidence strongly indicative of intentional harm, occurring under very similar circumstances, makes it extremely unlikely that all these factors would align if Jane were not guilty. Natural explanations like SIDS do not typically produce the specific trauma patterns described.\n\nThe physical evidence of trauma in both cases is the most compelling factor, as these injuries are not consistent with natural infant death syndromes.\n\n5"
