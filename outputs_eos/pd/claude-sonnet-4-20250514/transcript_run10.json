Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Their absence suggests the death may not have been due to smothering.\n\nThe fact that nurses didn't note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital is significant - if the injuries were severe enough to indicate abuse, trained medical professionals would likely have observed and documented them. This suggests either:\n1. The injuries occurred post-admission (during resuscitation/medical procedures)\n2. The injuries were subtle and developed/became apparent post-mortem\n3.

If she had inflicted fatal injuries through smothering/abuse, trained medical professionals would likely have observed and documented obvious signs of trauma upon admission. The absence of such contemporaneous medical documentation suggests the injuries may have occurred after hospital admission.\n\nThe absence of petechiae in Ben is particularly significant if Jane is guilty. Petechiae are described as typical/characteristic findings in smothering cases. If Jane had smothered Ben, we would strongly expect to see these telltale signs. Their absence contradicts what would be expected from the alleged method of murder.\n\nThe dislocated ribs, while potentially consistent with abuse, can also commonly occur post-mortem or during resuscitation - this evidence is ambiguous and doesn't strongly support guilt.\n\nThe spinal bleeding being common in natural deaths means this finding doesn't particularly support a murder theory.\n\nAndy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts provides an alternative explanation that would undermine the murder theory for his death as well.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, we would expect clearer, more definitive signs of abuse that couldn't be easily explained by medical procedures or natural post-mortem changes.
