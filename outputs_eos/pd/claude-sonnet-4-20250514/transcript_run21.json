Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me consider each piece of evidence:\n\n1. Two infant deaths in the same family: While rare, this can occur naturally. SIDS has a rate of 1 in 4,000, so two SIDS deaths in one family, while uncommon, is possible.\n\n2. Similarities in circumstances (age, time of day, feeding, Jane alone): These could be explained by routine care patterns and the typical age range when SIDS occurs.\n\n3. Physical evidence in Andy: Bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, blood in lung - these are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" While some post-mortem changes or medical intervention artifacts are possible, this combination is highly suspicious for non-accidental trauma.\n\n4. Physical evidence in Ben: Hypoxic brain damage, eye and eyelid hemorrhages, rib and spinal cord injuries - these are described as \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"\n\n5. Timing of Ben's brain injury: Alleged to have occurred \"hours before death\" - this suggests a specific traumatic event rather than a sudden natural death.\n\nThe combination of specific traumatic injuries in both children that are characteristic of smothering, along with the circumstantial similarities, makes it extremely unlikely that all this evidence would be present if the deaths were natural.\n\nThe physical evidence of trauma in both children is the most damning - while one might argue about circumstantial similarities, the medical evidence of injuries consistent with smothering in both cases makes natural causes highly improbable.\n\n5"

Andy's injuries attributed to resuscitation attempts: If Andy died naturally and resuscitation was attempted, the bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lung could reasonably result from aggressive CPR attempts, especially on a fragile infant. This would be quite likely.\n\n2. Ben's injuries not noted by hospital nurses: If Ben had been smothered, obvious external injuries would likely be visible to medical professionals. The fact that nurses didn't observe injuries upon arrival supports the possibility that visible trauma wasn't present at that time, which is more consistent with natural death.\n\n3. Absence of petechiae in Ben: Petechiae are common signs of smothering/asphyxiation. Their absence makes smothering less likely and natural death more plausible.\n\n4. Spinal bleeding in Ben described as \"common in natural death\": If this is a normal post-mortem finding, it doesn't indicate abuse.\n\n5. Dislocated ribs \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation\": These could result from CPR attempts or natural post-mortem changes rather than abuse.\n\nThis additional information significantly changes the picture. The injuries that initially appeared suspicious now have plausible innocent explanations - resuscitation attempts, post-mortem changes, and normal findings in natural infant death. The absence of typical smothering signs (like petechiae) and the lack of observable injuries when Ben arrived at hospital both support natural causes.\n\n75"

Ben's injuries not noted by hospital nurses: If Jane had just smothered Ben, there would likely be visible external signs of trauma, bruising, or other indicators that trained medical professionals would observe. The fact that nurses didn't note injuries upon arrival is problematic for the guilt hypothesis - it suggests either very subtle smothering techniques or that obvious traumatic injuries weren't present.\n\n2.

If Jane smothered Ben, the absence of this common and expected sign of asphyxiation is inconsistent with the typical presentation of smothering cases.\n\n3.

Andy's injuries: If Jane smothered Andy, the injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts creates ambiguity - the same injuries could result from either smothering or legitimate medical intervention.\n\n5. Spinal bleeding in Ben: If this is commonly found in natural deaths, it doesn't specifically support the smothering theory.\n\nIf Jane committed these murders, we would expect clearer, more definitive signs of smothering that couldn't be easily explained by resuscitation or natural post-mortem changes.
