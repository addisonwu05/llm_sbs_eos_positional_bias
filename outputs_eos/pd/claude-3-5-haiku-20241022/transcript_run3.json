Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

SIDS Frequency:\n- SIDS occurs 1 in 4,000 births\n- Jane had two children die under similar circumstances\n- Probability of two SIDS deaths in same family is extremely low\n\n2. Timing Similarities:\n- Both babies died around same age (8-11 weeks)\n- Both died after being fed\n- Both found unconscious by Jane when alone\n\n3. Specific Physical Evidence:\n- Hypoxic brain damage specific to hours before death\n- Haemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n- Bruises on arms/legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n\nThese are highly specific and unlikely coincidences, particularly the physical trauma evidence which suggests non-natural causes.\n\nStatistical analysis would suggest these precise circumstances occurring naturally would be extraordinarily rare - effectively approaching zero probability of being accidental.\n\nThe combination of SIDS rarity, identical circumstantial details, and specific physical trauma strongly suggests deliberate action rather than coincidence.\n\nThe probability of these occurrences being purely coincidental is vanishingly small.\n\nProbability: 1"
