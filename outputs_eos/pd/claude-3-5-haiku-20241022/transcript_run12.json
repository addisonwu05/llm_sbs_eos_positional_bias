Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the probability of these striking similarities and specific medical findings occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty, I'll consider several key factors:\n\n1. Coincidental timing of deaths (both around 8-11 weeks old)\n2. Similar circumstances of being found unconscious by Jane\n3. Specific medical findings of trauma in both cases\n4. SIDS frequency (1 in 4,000)\n\nThe combination of multiple precise medical indicators (hypoxic brain damage, hemorrhages, bruises, torn frenulum, lung blood) across two separate incidents is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nThe medical evidence suggests non-accidental injury, particularly the specific trauma patterns found in Andy's re-examined autopsy. The doctor's statement about Ben's hypoxic damage occurring hours before death further supports intentional harm.\n\nThe simultaneous occurrence of these exact medical findings in two separate infant deaths by the same parent, with identical circumstantial characteristics, suggests an extremely low probability of random chance.\n\nWhile not impossible, the confluence of these specific factors makes a coincidental explanation extraordinarily improbable.\n\nProbability of these findings occurring by chance if Jane is not guilty: 1"
