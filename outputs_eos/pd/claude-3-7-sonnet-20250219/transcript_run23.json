Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

SIDS often occurs during sleep after feeding.\n\n2) The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain occurring hours before death could potentially be explained by a natural medical emergency that progressed before becoming fatal.\n\n3) While hypoxic brain damage and eye hemorrhages are consistent with smothering, they can also occur in other conditions including some natural deaths with respiratory distress.\n\n4) The bruises, torn frenulum, and lung blood in Andy are concerning, but some medical conditions can cause bruising, and resuscitation attempts can sometimes cause injuries that appear suspicious.\n\nHowever, the combination of all these findings in both children is extremely unusual. The specific injuries found in both children are recognized indicators of potential abuse. The probability of two SIDS deaths in one family is already quite low (approximately 1 in 16 million based on general SIDS rates), and the additional specific injuries make coincidental natural causes even more unlikely.\n\n5"

Their absence weakens the case for smothering.\n\n4) Spinal bleeding being \"a common finding in natural death\" provides an alternative explanation for one of the key injuries, and if the rib dislocations can be attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem handling, these findings become less incriminating.\n\nGiven these alternative explanations for all the key injuries, and the absence of some expected smothering indicators, the likelihood that these findings would be present if Jane is not guilty is substantially higher than initially appeared.\n\n70"

However, we would generally expect at least some visible injuries to be noted during initial examination if death was caused by violence.\n\n2) The absence of petechiae in Ben is somewhat inconsistent with smothering. Petechiae are considered characteristic (though not universal) findings in asphyxial deaths. Their absence doesn't rule out smothering but makes it less typical.\n\n3) If Jane is guilty, the dislocated ribs could still be explained by aggressive resuscitation attempts, even if the underlying cause of cardiac arrest was smothering.\n\n4) Andy's injuries, if caused by smothering, could reasonably appear similar to resuscitation injuries, as the mechanisms of injury can overlap.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the pattern of injuries still presents some inconsistencies with typical smothering deaths, particularly the absence of petechiae and the lack of documentation of injuries upon hospital arrival.\n\n60"
