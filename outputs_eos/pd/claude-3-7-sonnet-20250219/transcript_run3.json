Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Particularly concerning is the combination of:\n1. Multiple traumatic injuries to different body parts\n2. Two children with similar suspicious deaths\n3. Similar timing patterns (both after feeding, both when alone with Jane)\n4. Hypoxic damage occurring hours before death\n\nWhile SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 cases, the chance of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely rare. Moreover, SIDS typically doesn't present with the specific constellation of traumatic injuries found in these cases.\n\nThe medical evidence strongly indicates non-accidental trauma rather than natural causes.

The hemorrhages in Ben's eyes and eyelids are classic signs of asphyxiation.

Ben's injuries weren't noted by hospital staff initially - This significantly weakens the murder case, as severe injuries would likely have been observed upon admission.\n\n2. No petechiae found on Ben - Petechiae are common findings in smothering deaths, and their absence makes the smothering explanation less compelling.\n\n3. Andy's injuries are consistent with resuscitation attempts - Bruising, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs can all occur during aggressive CPR on infants, offering a plausible alternative explanation.\n\n4. Ben's spinal bleeding is common in natural deaths - This provides an alternative non-criminal explanation.\n\n5. Ben's dislocated ribs could be from resuscitation or post-mortem - Rib injuries are known complications of CPR, especially in infants.\n\nGiven these alternative explanations, the medical evidence becomes more ambiguous. The injuries could reasonably be explained by resuscitation attempts and natural processes rather than intentional harm.
