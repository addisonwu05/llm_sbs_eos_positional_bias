Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Both children independently developed life-threatening conditions\n2. The physical findings in both cases that suggest trauma occurred through other means\n3. The timing and circumstances being similar was coincidental\n\nThe physical evidence, particularly the trauma indicators in both children, is very difficult to explain through natural causes or coincidence. While SIDS is a possibility for unexplained infant deaths, the specific trauma indicators described go beyond typical SIDS cases.\n\nGiven the multiple similarities, the timing, and especially the physical evidence indicating trauma in both cases, the probability that all these findings would occur if Jane is not guilty is extremely low.\n\n5"
