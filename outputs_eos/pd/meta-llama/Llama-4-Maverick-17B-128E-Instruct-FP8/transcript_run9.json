Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed similarities and medical findings if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring independently in the context of two SIDS deaths.\n\n1. **Similarities between both incidents**: Both babies dying at a similar age and under similar circumstances (just after being fed, found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them) could be considered coincidental given that both were infants and thus likely to be under similar care and observation patterns. The probability of both dying of SIDS is low but not directly relevant; what's at issue is the probability of the specific circumstances surrounding their deaths being similar.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS, the presence of hypoxic damage a matter of hours before death is not directly explained by SIDS, as SIDS is typically associated with a sudden death without prior signs of distress that would lead to detectable hypoxic damage hours before death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These findings are not typical for SIDS and are more indicative of a violent or traumatic cause of death, or at least an episode of significant hypoxia.\n\n4. **Bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: These findings, upon re-examination, are highly suggestive of non-accidental injury rather than SIDS.\n\nGiven that SIDS is by definition a sudden and unexplained death, the presence of significant pathological findings (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages, bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) in both infants is unusual and not characteristic of SIDS. SIDS does not typically present with such clear signs of trauma or prior hypoxia.\n\nThe probability that both deaths were SIDS and yet presented with these specific findings and similarities is low. SIDS is rare (1 in 4,000), and while it can occur in siblings, the recurrence risk is still considered to be low, though somewhat higher than in the general population. However, the specific findings in both Andy and Ben are not typical for SIDS.\n\nConsidering the improbability of the medical findings being related to SIDS (due to the presence of trauma signs) and the low probability of SIDS occurring in both siblings with such similar circumstances, the overall likelihood that Jane is not guilty and these findings are coincidental is very low.\n\n5"

Thus, the similarities could be expected.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death**: Smothering could cause hypoxic damage, and if Jane smothered Ben, it is plausible that the hypoxic damage occurred as a result of this action, potentially happening a matter of hours before death if the smothering was not immediately fatal or if there were repeated episodes.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are consistent with smothering or other forms of asphyxia, supporting the hypothesis that Jane is guilty.\n\n4. **Bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: These findings, indicative of trauma, would support the notion that Andy was also a victim of smothering or other forms of abuse, consistent with Jane being guilty.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the observed medical findings and the similarities between the incidents are not only plausible but expected.

This could be plausible if the injuries were not immediately visible or occurred after hospital admission.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of such injuries could suggest that Ben's death was not due to smothering, supporting Jane's innocence.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being due to natural death or resuscitation attempts**: If these injuries can be explained by natural death or resuscitation attempts, it undermines the prosecution's case that they were indicative of smothering.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts**: If Andy's injuries can be explained by resuscitation attempts, this suggests that the initial autopsy findings might have been misinterpreted, supporting the possibility that Andy's death was also natural.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Jane is not guilty, it becomes more plausible that the observed injuries could be explained by factors other than smothering, such as resuscitation attempts or natural causes.

However, it's less likely that significant injuries like dislocated ribs would not be noticed.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of petechiae could be seen as inconsistent with smothering, but it's not conclusive evidence against it.

However, this doesn't directly support or refute her guilt.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts**: If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, the fact that his injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts could be seen as an attempt to obscure the truth. However, it is plausible that initial misinterpretation occurred.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, one might expect more clear-cut evidence of smothering, such as the presence of petechiae. The absence of such evidence and the alternative explanations for the injuries (e.g., resuscitation attempts) could be seen as reducing the likelihood of guilt or, at the very least, making the case less clear-cut.\n\nHowever, considering that smothering can sometimes occur without leaving typical signs, and that injuries can be misattributed or not immediately visible, it's still possible that Jane is guilty even with these factors.\n\n20"
