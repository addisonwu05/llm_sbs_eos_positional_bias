Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed similarities and medical findings if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring in the context of SIDS or other non-criminal causes.\n\n1. **Similarities between both incidents**: The fact that both babies died at a similar age, time of day, after being fed, and were found by Jane while she was alone with them could be coincidental or related to a common underlying factor (such as a genetic predisposition or an environmental factor). The probability of these similarities occurring by chance in two consecutive infants is low but not impossible.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain caused a matter of hours before death**: If Ben's death was due to SIDS or another natural cause, it's less likely that significant hypoxic damage would occur hours before death without other preceding symptoms or significant medical history. However, the presence of hypoxic damage suggests a possible underlying condition or event that led to his death.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids**: These are indicative of a possible asphyxial event or significant stress before death. While they can be associated with smothering, they are not exclusive to it and could potentially be related to other causes, though this is less likely.\n\n4. **Bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: These findings are highly suggestive of non-accidental injury. The presence of these injuries makes it less likely that Andy's death was due to SIDS.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, we are left to consider the likelihood of these medical findings and similarities occurring in the context of SIDS or another natural or accidental cause. SIDS is, by definition, unexplained and not directly associated with the specific traumatic injuries found in both babies.\n\nGiven the presence of significant injuries indicative of possible abuse (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung in Andy, and hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben), if Jane is not guilty, we are dealing with an extremely low probability event because these findings are not characteristic of SIDS.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially the specific medical findings indicative of possible non-accidental injury—makes the scenario of Jane not being guilty very unlikely.\n\n5"
