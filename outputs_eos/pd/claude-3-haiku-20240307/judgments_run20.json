  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities and medical findings occurring by chance is very low. The coincidence of two sudden infant deaths in the same family, with similar circumstances and medical evidence pointing towards smothering, is highly improbable.\n\nThe risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) do not seem to fully account for the specific injuries and medical findings in these cases. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung of Andy are more characteristic of intentional asphyxiation or trauma, rather than natural causes.\n\nThe temporal proximity of the two deaths, with both babies being around the same age and dying shortly after being fed while Jane was alone with them, further increases the suspicion of foul play.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring by chance is extremely low.\n\nProbability judgment: 10",
  "If Jane is guilty, the similarities between the two incidents, the medical findings, and the timing of the deaths are highly likely to occur.\n\nThe pattern of behavior, the suspicious medical evidence, and the coincidence of two infant deaths in the same family are all consistent with a case of intentional smothering or other forms of deadly abuse.\n\nThe hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung of Andy are all characteristic of asphyxiation and physical trauma, which would be expected if Jane is the perpetrator.\n\nThe temporal proximity of the two deaths, with both babies being around the same age and dying shortly after being fed while Jane was alone with them, further suggests a deliberate and calculated pattern of behavior.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these similarities and medical findings occurring is very high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the following factors is high:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital.\n2. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, in Ben.\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being consistent with natural death or resuscitation attempts.\n4. The injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe new information provided suggests that the medical evidence may not be as conclusive as initially presented. The lack of typical smothering injuries, the presence of injuries associated with natural causes or resuscitation efforts, and the nurses not noting the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital all point to the possibility that Jane may not be guilty.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the probability of these factors being true is high.\n\nProbability judgment: 80",

The presence of injuries typically associated with resuscitation efforts, rather than deliberate harm, casts doubt on the prosecution's case.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of nurses noting the injuries on Ben when he was brought to the hospital suggests that the injuries may have occurred later, potentially due to resuscitation attempts or other natural causes.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these factors being true is low.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "Based on the given evidence and the analysis of the probabilities, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the two counts of murder of her children is:\n\nProbability judgment: 60",
  "Based on the overall analysis of the evidence and probabilities, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nNot Guilty"
