  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely low.\n\nThe sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare but recognized phenomenon, and the similarities between the two deaths, as described, would be highly unlikely to occur by chance if Jane was not responsible.\n\nFurthermore, the specific medical findings, such as the hypoxic damage and the other injuries, are strongly indicative of intentional smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which are not typically associated with SIDS.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these circumstances occurring is 5%.\n\n5%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely high.\n\nThe pattern of injuries and circumstances described are highly consistent with intentional smothering or other forms of violent trauma, which would be expected if Jane is guilty of the murders.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, the timing, and the specific medical findings all point to a similar mechanism of death, which is highly unlikely to occur by chance if Jane is not responsible.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these circumstances occurring is 95%.\n\n95%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively high.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae, along with the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben being consistent with natural causes or resuscitation efforts, suggests that the severe injuries found may not have been present when he was initially brought to the hospital.\n\nSimilarly, the injuries found in Andy being attributed to resuscitation attempts at the time also aligns with the possibility that Jane is not guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these circumstances occurring is 85%.\n\n85%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low.\n\nThe absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae would be highly unusual if Jane had indeed smothered the infants. The dislocated ribs and other injuries found in Ben and Andy are more likely to be the result of intentional harm rather than natural causes or resuscitation efforts.\n\nGiven the pattern of injuries and the similarities between the two incidents, it is more plausible that Jane deliberately concealed or delayed the manifestation of the full extent of the injuries, rather than the injuries being absent or explainable by natural causes or resuscitation attempts.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the probability of these circumstances occurring is 20%.\n\n20%",
  "Based on the given evidence, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murders of her two children is high.\n\nThe similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies, the timing of their deaths, the presence of Jane when they were found unconscious, and the specific medical findings such as the hypoxic damage and hemorrhages, strongly suggest a pattern of intentional harm.\n\nWhile the alternative explanation of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is possible, the probability of these two nearly identical incidents occurring by chance is very low, as indicated by the 5% probability if Jane is not guilty.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of typical SIDS-related injuries, the concealment or delay in the manifestation of the full extent of the injuries, and the more plausible connection between the injuries and intentional harm further strengthen the case against Jane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given evidence, the probability that Jane is guilty of the murders of her two children is 85%.\n\n85%",
  "Based on the evidence and probability analysis provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGUILTY"
