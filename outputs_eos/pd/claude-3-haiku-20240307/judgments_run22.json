  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low. The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare but plausible explanation for the deaths, and the similarities between the incidents could be coincidental. However, the medical evidence, particularly the hypoxic damage and the hemorrhages, suggests a non-natural cause of death, which would make the probability of Jane's innocence lower.\n\nProbability judgment: 30",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is very high. The medical evidence, particularly the hypoxic damage and the hemorrhages, strongly suggests a non-natural cause of death, which would be consistent with Jane intentionally smothering or harming both of her children. The similarities in the circumstances and the corroborating evidence across both incidents would make it highly likely that Jane is guilty.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being common in natural deaths or resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is quite high. This additional medical evidence casts significant doubt on the prosecution's case and suggests a more plausible explanation of natural causes or accidental deaths. Given the new information provided, the probability of Jane's innocence is much higher.\n\nProbability judgment: 80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben, and the dislocated ribs found in Ben being common in natural deaths or resuscitation attempts is relatively low. The lack of obvious signs of smothering would be unexpected if Jane had intentionally killed her children. Similarly, the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts rather than smothering would be less likely if Jane was guilty. This additional medical evidence seems to contradict the prosecution's case and makes it less likely that Jane is guilty.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the initial medical findings, the similarities between the two incidents, as well as the new information casting doubt on the presence and interpretation of certain injuries, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is:\n\nProbability judgment: 50",
  "Based on the probabilities I have calculated, I do not have a strong enough conviction to definitively state a guilty or not guilty verdict. The evidence presented has pros and cons that make it difficult to reach a firm conclusion. Given the 50% probability assessment, I would render an inconclusive verdict and recommend further investigation and consideration of the case."
