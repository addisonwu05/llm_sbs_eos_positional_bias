  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is extremely low.\n\nThe probability of these events occurring together in the absence of foul play is very small, as the combination of factors points strongly to intentional harm or smothering rather than natural causes or SIDS.\n\nThe similarities between the two deaths, the specific injuries found, and the timing of events make it highly improbable that Jane is innocent. These factors collectively suggest a very high likelihood of guilt.\n\n20",

  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is quite high.\n\nThe new information provided suggests that the injuries found on Ben could have been caused by resuscitation attempts or natural causes, and were not noted by the nurses when he was brought in. The absence of typical smothering injuries further supports the possibility of natural causes.\n\nAdditionally, the injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to the resuscitation efforts, indicating they may not have been indicative of abuse.\n\nGiven this additional context, it is more likely that these similarities and injuries do not point to Jane's guilt, and could have natural or innocent explanations.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy is relatively low.\n\nThe new information provided suggests that the injuries found on Ben could have been caused by resuscitation attempts or natural causes, and were not noted by the nurses when he was brought in. However, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is less likely if Jane is guilty.\n\nAdditionally, the injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to the resuscitation efforts, but may have still been indicative of abuse if Jane is guilty.\n\nGiven the context, it is less probable that these similarities and injuries do not point to Jane's guilt, as they could still be explained by intentional harm rather than natural causes.\n\n35",
  "Based on the overall evidence presented, including the similarities between the two deaths, the specific injuries found, and the timing of events, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty is high.\n\nWhile some of the injuries could potentially be explained by natural causes or resuscitation efforts, the combination of factors strongly suggests a pattern of intentional harm rather than mere coincidence.\n\nThe probability that Jane is guilty is:\n\n70",
