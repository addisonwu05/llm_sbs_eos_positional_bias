    "content": "Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of\nthe case:\nAfter Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.\nWhen Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to\nbed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "In order to make a probability judgment, it is important to consider the unique circumstances surrounding both children's deaths, including the medical findings and the statistical likelihood of such occurrences being purely coincidental or indicative of another underlying cause.\n\n1. **Statistical Rarity**: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is known to occur at a rate of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. The probability of two children from the same family both dying from SIDS purely by chance becomes significantly lower.\n   \n2. **Medical Findings**: The injuries documented suggest possible non-accidental trauma. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung observed in Andy's re-examination, combined with Ben's hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages, could suggest a pattern inconsistent with SIDS alone.\n\n3. **Circumstantial Evidence**: The fact that both deaths occurred under similar circumstances, with Jane being alone with the children, should be considered. However, it is important to weigh this against corroborative evidence to avoid confirmation bias.\n\nGiven these points and the requirement to provide a probabilistic judgment strictly as an integer, estimating the likelihood of the described events occurring purely by chance within the context of the legal perspective and the available information:\n\n**2**"
