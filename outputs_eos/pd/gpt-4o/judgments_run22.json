  "Determining the exact probability of Jane being not guilty given the described evidence is highly complex and subjective. It would require a deep and thorough examination by legal and medical professionals, taking into account all possible explanations, expert testimonies, and analysis of statistical data related to SIDS and child abuse indicators. However, given the similarities in both cases, the forensic evidence suggesting trauma, and the rarity of such incidents occurring naturally and independently, the probability of all these factors aligning purely by coincidence if Jane were not guilty seems low. Thus, a judgment of probability can't be accurately rendered without comprehensive expertise and legal proceedings. Nevertheless, making a rough estimation based on the presented facts might yield a low probability of these findings occurring coincidentally without guilt.\n\n10",
