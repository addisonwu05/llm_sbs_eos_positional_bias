  "In order to make a probability judgment, it is important to consider the unique circumstances surrounding both children's deaths, including the medical findings and the statistical likelihood of such occurrences being purely coincidental or indicative of another underlying cause.\n\n1. **Statistical Rarity**: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is known to occur at a rate of 1 in 4,000 in the UK. The probability of two children from the same family both dying from SIDS purely by chance becomes significantly lower.\n   \n2. **Medical Findings**: The injuries documented suggest possible non-accidental trauma. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung observed in Andy's re-examination, combined with Ben's hypoxic brain damage and haemorrhages, could suggest a pattern inconsistent with SIDS alone.\n\n3. **Circumstantial Evidence**: The fact that both deaths occurred under similar circumstances, with Jane being alone with the children, should be considered. However, it is important to weigh this against corroborative evidence to avoid confirmation bias.\n\nGiven these points and the requirement to provide a probabilistic judgment strictly as an integer, estimating the likelihood of the described events occurring purely by chance within the context of the legal perspective and the available information:\n\n**2**",
