  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that her children's deaths were due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or other non-abusive reasons not involving her. Let's evaluate the likelihood of the described evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Injuries to Andy (first son):** The re-examination of Andy's autopsy found \"bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung.\" The text explicitly states these are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Andy's death was natural (e.g., SIDS), finding such injuries is highly contradictory to the definition of SIDS and extremely unlikely to occur naturally. A torn frenulum (the membrane under the tongue or lip) usually results from trauma, and blood in the lung points to significant internal injury or asphyxia, neither of which are natural SIDS findings.\n\n2.  **Injuries to Ben (second son):** Ben's autopsy revealed \"injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids.\" These are described as \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Similar to Andy, if Ben's death was natural, these specific injuries are highly unusual and strongly suggest a non-natural cause. Eye haemorrhages and widespread hypoxic damage are classic signs of asphyxia or severe head trauma, not typical for SIDS.\n\n3.  **Timing of Ben's hypoxic damage:** It was alleged by the doctor that \"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death.\" SIDS is, by definition, a *sudden* and unexpected death. A prolonged period of hypoxia lasting \"hours\" before death is inconsistent with a sudden event and points towards an ongoing process, making a natural SIDS explanation very improbable.\n\n4.  **Similarities between both incidents:** The incidents share \"astonishing\" similarities: both babies about the same age, died at a similar time after feeding, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone. While some familial patterns in SIDS can occur, the combination of these specific similarities in two separate deaths is statistically rare. More importantly, when combined with the highly suspicious and trauma-indicative injuries in *both* children (as described above), these similarities become incredibly unlikely to be coincidental for two natural deaths.\n\n**Conclusion if Jane is NOT GUILTY:**\nIf Jane is not guilty, then both deaths must have been natural. However, the forensic evidence in both cases (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung for Andy; rib/spinal cord injuries, hypoxic brain damage, eye/eyelid haemorrhages for Ben) is explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse,\" \"characteristic of smothering,\" or \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Furthermore, the timing of Ben's injury (hours before death) contradicts the sudden nature of SIDS. The likelihood of *all* these pieces of evidence occurring naturally, without any form of abuse or non-natural cause, is exceedingly low. The evidence directly contradicts the hypothesis of natural death.\n\nConsidering the cumulative improbability of finding such specific, trauma-indicating injuries in two separate infants dying naturally, coupled with the \"astonishing similarities\" and the specific timing of Ben's injury, the likelihood of this evidence existing if Jane were innocent (i.e., if both deaths were natural) is extremely remote.\n\n1",
