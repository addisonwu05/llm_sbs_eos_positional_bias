  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that the deaths of Andy and Ben were not caused by her. Given the charges of murder by smothering, the most direct interpretation of \"Not Guilty\" in this context is that the children died of natural causes (such as SIDS) or that the severe injuries were somehow accidental or misinterpreted.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of the described evidence if Jane is not guilty and the deaths were from natural causes:\n\n1.  **Andy's Re-examination Findings:** Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Andy died of natural causes, it is highly improbable for these specific injuries, particularly the combination, to be present and accurately interpreted as \"characteristic of smothering.\" Natural SIDS typically does not leave such marks.\n2.  **Ben's Autopsy Findings:** Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These findings are described as \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Injuries to the ribs and especially the spinal cord are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to explain by natural causes or typical resuscitation efforts. Hypoxic damage occurring \"a matter of hours before death\" further rules out a simple SIDS event where hypoxia is the terminal event.\n3.  **Similarities between Incidents:** Both babies about the same age (11 weeks vs 8 weeks), died at similar times of the day after being fed, and were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them. While two SIDS deaths can occur in the same family (though still rare), the probability of such an exact set of circumstantial similarities, *combined with the severe, abuse-indicative injuries in both cases*, occurring if both deaths were genuinely natural and independent, is extraordinarily low. The \"Jane alone\" factor for two highly suspicious deaths is also a critical component.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe medical evidence for both children, particularly Ben's spinal cord and rib injuries, strongly points to non-accidental trauma or abuse. The expert interpretation explicitly links these findings to smothering or violent trauma. If Jane is innocent, and the deaths were due to natural causes, then these severe and specific injuries would either have to be unprecedented natural phenomena (such as an unknown natural cause for spinal cord injury in an infant) or a profound misinterpretation of medical evidence by multiple experts. The combination of these severe, abuse-consistent injuries in two children in the same family, coupled with the astonishing circumstantial similarities, makes a natural-causes explanation (and thus Jane being not guilty) extremely unlikely.\n\nGiven the strength and specificity of the medical evidence pointing to trauma/abuse, it is virtually impossible for all these findings to occur if Jane is truly innocent and the deaths were from natural causes.\n\n0",
