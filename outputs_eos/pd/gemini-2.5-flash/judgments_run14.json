  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that the deaths of both Andy and Ben were due to natural causes, SIDS, or accidents that Jane was not responsible for. We need to evaluate the likelihood of all the described evidence occurring under this hypothesis.\n\nLet's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **Andy's Re-examination Findings:** Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n    *   For an 11-week-old baby, a torn frenulum is a very strong indicator of non-accidental trauma (abuse). Bruises on the arms and legs of a non-mobile infant are also highly suspicious. Blood in the lung, in conjunction with these other findings, further points to trauma.\n    *   If Jane is not guilty, these injuries would have to be explained by natural causes or an accident not involving abuse. The probability of such a specific and traumatic constellation of injuries occurring naturally or accidentally without abuse in an infant is exceedingly low.\n\n2.  **Ben's Autopsy Findings:** Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord (mentioned in background, though not specifically in the final question for calculation), hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain (alleged to have occurred for hours before death), and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"\n    *   Haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids (especially retinal haemorrhages) are strong indicators of asphyxia or abusive head trauma in infants. Significant hypoxic damage lasting for hours before death is inconsistent with a sudden, unexplained death like typical SIDS and points towards a sustained lack of oxygen.\n    *   If Jane is not guilty, these findings would have to be explained by natural causes or an accident not involving violent trauma. The probability of these specific injuries arising naturally is also extremely low.\n\n3.  **Similarities between Incidents:** Both babies were about the same age when they died (11 weeks vs. 8 weeks), they both died at a similar time of day after just being fed, and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n    *   The age range (8-11 weeks) is within the peak window for SIDS, so this aspect isn't inherently unlikely if deaths were natural. Babies are also often put to bed after feeding.\n    *   However, the fact that Jane was alone with both babies when they were found unconscious, combined with the severe traumatic injuries, is a significant coincidence if both deaths were genuinely natural or accidental without her involvement. If Jane was, for example, alone with the children 50% of the time, the probability of her being alone at the time of death for two independent natural deaths would be 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, which is not extremely low by itself. But this needs to be considered in conjunction with the highly suspicious medical findings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe \"SIDS\" explanation for the deaths is contradicted by the specific and severe traumatic injuries found in both children, which are explicitly described as \"indicative of abuse,\" \"characteristic of smothering,\" and \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion for *unexplained* infant deaths. The presence of these injuries provides a strong explanation.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, then these severe, abuse-indicative injuries in two separate children must have occurred by natural causes or accidents not involving Jane. The probability of an 11-week-old infant naturally sustaining a torn frenulum, bruises, and blood in the lung, and an 8-week-old infant naturally developing prolonged hypoxic damage and ocular haemorrhages, is astronomically low for a single child, let alone two within the same family, with similar circumstantial findings.\n\nThe combined probability of all this evidence occurring if Jane were truly not guilty is incredibly small. While not strictly impossible (as rare medical conditions or freak accidents can occur), the likelihood is extremely remote.\n\n1",

  "The new information significantly reinterprets many of the previously suspicious findings:\n\n1.  **Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung):** The statement now clarifies that these were \"initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY and Andy died of natural causes, it is highly likely that resuscitation attempts were made, and thus the presence of these injuries becomes quite probable under the \"not guilty\" hypothesis.\n\n2.  **Ben's spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs:** The new information states that \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY and Ben died of natural causes, then the presence of these findings is highly likely.\n\n3.  **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** The new information states that \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning Ben did not die by smothering), then the absence of petechiae is expected and consistent with this hypothesis. Even if smothering occurred, petechiae are not universally present, but their absence weakens the case for smothering, thereby supporting the \"not guilty\" hypothesis.\n\n4.  **Ben's injuries not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane is NOT GUILTY, and Ben died of natural causes, then any injuries later found at autopsy (such as internal bleeding, dislocated ribs post-mortem, or hypoxic damage) would likely not be externally apparent or noted by nurses upon initial presentation. This is a plausible scenario if the injuries are internal, subtle, or occurred/developed after presentation or during resuscitation.\n\nConsidering all these points together:\n*   Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation makes their presence likely if Jane is not guilty.\n*   Ben's spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being common in natural death/resuscitation makes their presence likely if Jane is not guilty.\n*   The absence of petechiae makes it less likely that smothering occurred, thus being more consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n*   Injuries not being noted by nurses is plausible if they are internal, subtle, or developed later, which is consistent with natural death scenarios.\n\nEach of these specific pieces of evidence, given the new context, is now moderately to highly likely if Jane is NOT GUILTY. Therefore, the combined probability of these specific elements occurring under the \"not guilty\" hypothesis is significantly higher than previously assessed.\n\nThe only remaining deeply suspicious elements from the original description (hypoxic damage to Ben's brain lasting hours and haemorrhages to the eyes/eyelids) are not explicitly re-explained by the new information as \"natural\" or \"resuscitation-related,\" but the question specifically asks only about the likelihood of the *four bulleted points* (Andy's injuries, Ben's spinal/ribs, Ben's lack of petechiae, Ben's injuries not noted by nurses) occurring if Jane is not guilty. Based on the new information, these four points become quite consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\n55",
