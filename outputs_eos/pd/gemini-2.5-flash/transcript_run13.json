Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "The probability that these specific medical findings and similarities would be present if Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning the children died of SIDS or another natural cause) is extremely low.\n\nHere's why:\n*   **Medical Findings Contradict SIDS:** The key piece of information is that the described injuries for both children (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, bruises to arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" or \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a diagnosis of exclusion; it is applied when a thorough investigation, including autopsy, fails to find a cause of death. The presence of these specific traumatic injuries and signs of asphyxiation would *rule out* a SIDS diagnosis. Therefore, if the children truly died of SIDS, these findings should not be present in their autopsies.\n*   **Doctor's Allegation:** The allegation that Ben's hypoxic damage was caused \"a matter of hours before death\" also goes against the definition of SIDS, which is a *sudden* and *unexplained* death.\n*   **Similarities in Incidents:** While two SIDS deaths in one family are rare (approximately 1 in 16 million if based on general population SIDS rates), the specific similarities in circumstances (same age range, similar time after feeding, Jane alone at discovery) occurring twice by pure chance are also quite improbable. However, the medical findings are far more decisive.\n\nBecause the listed medical findings directly contradict and would typically preclude a diagnosis of SIDS, the likelihood of finding this evidence if Jane is not guilty (and the deaths were natural like SIDS) is exceptionally remote. The question is essentially asking, \"If the deaths were natural, how likely is it that the autopsies would show strong evidence of unnatural, violent death?\" This probability is very close to zero.\n\n1"

Any internal injuries would not typically be noted externally. This makes the absence of nurse observation highly likely.\n3.  **\"Despite the injuries found on Ben, no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae (tiny red or purple spots that can appear on the skin).\"** If Jane is NOT GUILTY, Ben was not smothered.
