  "To answer this question, we need to evaluate the probability of all the described evidence occurring *if Jane is NOT GUILTY*. If Jane is not guilty, the most plausible alternative explanation for the deaths of her children, as suggested in the background, is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or some other form of natural/accidental death not caused by Jane.\n\nLet's break down the evidence and assess its likelihood under the assumption that Jane is not guilty:\n\n1.  **Two deaths with \"astonishing similarities\":** Both babies were about the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks), died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n    *   **Under \"not guilty\" (e.g., SIDS):** While SIDS can occur more than once in a family (though extremely rare; the probability of two independent SIDS deaths is (1/4000) * (1/4000) = 1 in 16,000,000), the combination of such specific circumstances (age, time of day, and critically, Jane being alone with *both* children when they were found) is highly suspicious and extremely unlikely to be coincidental if the deaths were natural.\n\n2.  **Specific injuries and findings in Ben:** Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are described as \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Additionally, it was alleged by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain \"must have been caused a matter of hours before death.\"\n    *   **Under \"not guilty\" (e.g., SIDS):** SIDS is defined as a sudden and *unexplained* death without clear evidence of trauma. The injuries found in Ben (ribs, spinal cord, severe brain hypoxia, ocular haemorrhages) are clear signs of violent trauma. The hypoxic damage occurring \"a matter of hours before death\" directly contradicts the sudden nature of SIDS. These findings are not consistent with SIDS or any known natural cause of death. For these to exist if Jane is not guilty, they would have to be either a gross misinterpretation of post-mortem findings or the result of an incredibly rare and severe accident unrelated to Jane, which also happened to occur when she was alone with the child.\n\n3.  **Specific injuries and findings in Andy:** Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. These are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These findings were discovered during a re-examination of autopsy photographs, overturning an initial suggestion of natural causes.\n    *   **Under \"not guilty\" (e.g., SIDS):** Similar to Ben's case, these injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are clear indicators of physical trauma and abuse. A torn frenulum, for example, is often associated with forced feeding or trauma to the mouth. Such injuries are incompatible with a diagnosis of SIDS, which by definition lacks such explanatory findings. The probability of these specific traumatic injuries occurring naturally or accidentally, in the absence of abuse, is extremely low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, then the deaths of both children must have been due to natural causes (like SIDS) or an accident not caused by her. However, the medical evidence presented for both children directly contradicts this.\n*   The findings in both children are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" or \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Such findings are by definition absent in SIDS.\n*   The specific timing of Ben's hypoxic damage (\"hours before death\") rules out a sudden natural death.\n*   The sheer number, severity, and consistency of traumatic injuries in *both* children (ribs, spinal cord, brain hypoxia, ocular haemorrhages in Ben; bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung in Andy) make it astronomically improbable that these are the result of natural causes or unrelated accidents.\n*   The \"astonishing similarities\" in circumstances (age, time, Jane being alone) further reduce the likelihood of these events being natural and independent.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it would imply that the extensive medical findings of trauma and abuse in both children are fundamentally incorrect, or that an extraordinary series of coincidences involving severe accidents occurred when Jane was alone, mimicking abuse perfectly. The probability of such a scenario is extremely remote.\n\n1",
