  "The question asks for the likelihood of the described evidence occurring if Jane is NOT GUILTY. If Jane is not guilty, the most plausible alternative explanation for the deaths, given the context, is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n\nLet's evaluate the evidence under the hypothesis that both children died of SIDS:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents (age, time of day, found by Jane alone):** While some aspects like age range and time of death might overlap with SIDS patterns, the \"astonishing\" similarity, particularly Jane being alone with both children when found, is a coincidence that might raise suspicion even under SIDS, but is not inherently impossible. However, the *combination* with other findings is key.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** SIDS is defined as a \"sudden and unexplainable death.\" The presence of hypoxic damage *hours before* death contradicts the \"sudden\" aspect of SIDS and suggests a prolonged period of oxygen deprivation, which is not characteristic of SIDS.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These findings are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Such significant signs of asphyxia/trauma are not found in SIDS; SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out all other causes, including trauma.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** These findings are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These are clear signs of trauma and abuse and are incompatible with a diagnosis of SIDS, which by definition lacks such findings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies the children died of natural causes, specifically SIDS. However, the evidence presented directly contradicts the definition and typical findings of SIDS for *both* children. The presence of clear and explicit signs of trauma/asphyxia (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung, hypoxic damage, haemorrhages) that are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" in both infants, along with one instance of hypoxic damage occurring \"hours before death\" (contradicting \"sudden\"), makes it extremely improbable that these deaths were due to SIDS. SIDS is diagnosed when *no* such cause, including trauma, can be identified. Therefore, the likelihood of observing all this evidence if the deaths were truly SIDS is exceptionally low.\n\n1",
