  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that the deaths of both children were due to natural causes, with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) being the specific alternative explanation provided.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of the described evidence occurring if the deaths were truly SIDS:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** While \"astonishing\" and statistically improbable for two independent SIDS deaths to occur with such similar circumstances (age, time, discovery by Jane alone), it's not strictly impossible. SIDS does cluster in age ranges and can occur during sleep after feeding.\n\n2.  **Ben's injuries:**\n    *   **Injuries to the ribs and spinal cord:** These are signs of significant trauma and are *not* consistent with SIDS or any known natural cause of infant death.\n    *   **Hypoxic damage to the brain (caused a matter of hours before death) and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** These are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" SIDS can involve hypoxia during the terminal event, but specific long-standing hypoxic damage and haemorrhages of this nature are highly indicative of trauma, not natural causes.\n\n3.  **Andy's injuries (re-examination findings):**\n    *   **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung:** These findings are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" A torn frenulum (the membrane under the tongue or lip) is a sign of trauma to the mouth, and bruises indicate external force. These are *not* consistent with SIDS or any natural cause of death.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is only assigned after all other causes, including accidental and non-accidental trauma, have been ruled out. The presence of multiple, specific traumatic injuries in both children (ribs, spinal cord, torn frenulum, bruises, eye/eyelid haemorrhages, and the nature of the hypoxic damage) directly contradicts a diagnosis of SIDS. These injuries are medically incompatible with natural death.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is truly not guilty, and the deaths were due to natural causes like SIDS, the likelihood of finding such clear and consistent evidence of violent trauma and smothering is extremely low, effectively close to zero, as the presence of these injuries rules out SIDS as the cause of death.\n\n1",
