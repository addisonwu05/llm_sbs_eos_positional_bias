  "The likelihood of all the described evidence (similarities between incidents, hypoxic damage dating hours before death and specific injuries in Ben, and bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy) occurring if Jane is NOT GUILTY (meaning both children died of natural causes like SIDS) is extremely low.\n\nHere's why:\n*   **Medical Findings in Andy:** The text explicitly states that \"bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung... are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These are not findings associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a diagnosis of exclusion for sudden, unexplained deaths. A torn frenulum and bruises are physical injuries inconsistent with a natural death.\n*   **Medical Findings in Ben:** The \"hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Again, these findings are highly suggestive of trauma/asphyxia and are not typical for SIDS. The allegation that the hypoxic damage occurred \"a matter of hours before death\" also contradicts the \"sudden\" nature of SIDS.\n*   **Similarities and Rarity of Double SIDS:** While SIDS is defined as \"unexplainable,\" the occurrence of two SIDS deaths in the same family is exceedingly rare (statistically, 1 in 16,000,000, though some genetic factors can increase familial risk, it remains a very rare event). The striking similarities in circumstances (age, time of day, Jane being alone) further reduce the likelihood of these being purely natural coincidences if Jane is not guilty.\n\nCombining these points, particularly the strong medical evidence of trauma and asphyxia in both children, makes it highly improbable that these findings would be present if both children died of natural causes and Jane was not guilty.\n\n1",
