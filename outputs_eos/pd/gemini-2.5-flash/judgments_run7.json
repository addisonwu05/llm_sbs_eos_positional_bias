  "The question asks for the probability of observing all the stated evidence *if Jane is NOT GUILTY*. If Jane is not guilty, the deaths must have occurred due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or another unexplainable natural event.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under the assumption of Jane's innocence (i.e., natural deaths):\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** While some features like being found by the mother and dying after feeding might align with SIDS patterns, the *combination* of all these similarities in two children, especially when combined with the medical findings, becomes highly suspicious. Two SIDS deaths in the same family are extremely rare (e.g., probability of two independent SIDS deaths is 1 in 16 million), though a slight familial predisposition is sometimes debated. Even with a familial risk, it remains a very low probability event.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** This finding directly contradicts the sudden and unexplained nature of SIDS. SIDS is typically considered a rapid event, not one preceded by hours of brain damage. This specific timing points away from natural causes.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The text explicitly states these are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" These findings are characteristic indicators of suffocation or severe head trauma, not typical findings in natural infant deaths, including SIDS.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** The text explicitly states these are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" These injuries (torn frenulum, bruising, blood in the lung) are not associated with natural causes of death, particularly SIDS. They strongly suggest external force or trauma.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor Jane to be NOT GUILTY, both children must have died of natural causes. However, the evidence, particularly the specific medical findings in both children, is overwhelmingly *inconsistent* with natural causes and is explicitly stated as being \"indicative of abuse,\" \"characteristic of smothering,\" and \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"\n\nIf the deaths were natural, it would be extraordinarily improbable for all these specific injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung, hypoxic brain damage hours before death, eye/eyelid haemorrhages, rib and spinal cord injuries) to manifest naturally, and for these natural occurrences to mimic the signs of smothering so perfectly in two separate children.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of observing all these pieces of evidence if Jane is innocent (and the deaths were natural) is exceptionally low.\n\n1",
