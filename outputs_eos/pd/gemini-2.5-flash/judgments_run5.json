  "Given that Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that both children died of natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other unexplainable natural events. We need to assess the likelihood of the observed evidence under this assumption.\n\nLet's break down the evidence:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** Both babies were about the same age (11 weeks and 8 weeks), died at a similar time of day after being fed, and were found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n    *   While SIDS typically occurs in infants and often during sleep/after feeding, the recurrence of SIDS in two children in the same family is exceedingly rare. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in 4,000. If two such events were independent, the probability would be (1/4000) * (1/4000) = 1 in 16,000,000. Even with potential familial risk factors that might increase recurrence (not specified here), it remains an extremely rare event. The \"astonishing\" similarities further reduce the likelihood of this being a mere coincidence of natural deaths.\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain caused a matter of hours before death:**\n    *   While oxygen deprivation can occur in various severe medical events, \"sudden and unexplainable\" SIDS typically doesn't involve hypoxic damage hours before death. This finding points away from a sudden, unexplained natural death.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:**\n    *   These findings are explicitly stated to be \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" Retinal hemorrhages, in particular, are highly indicative of non-accidental trauma (like abusive head trauma or suffocation) in infants and are generally not characteristic of SIDS or other natural causes of death, except in extremely rare and specific medical conditions.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:**\n    *   These findings are explicitly stated to be \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" A torn frenulum (the membrane connecting the lip to the gum) in an infant is a strong marker of trauma to the mouth, often associated with force or abuse, and is not a natural finding in SIDS or other natural causes of death. Bruises and blood in the lung, in conjunction with other findings suggestive of trauma, further support a non-natural cause.\n\n**Conclusion under the \"NOT GUILTY\" assumption:**\nIf Jane is not guilty, then both children died from natural causes (e.g., SIDS). However, the evidence presented directly contradicts this explanation:\n*   The extreme rarity of two SIDS deaths in one family, especially with \"astonishing\" similarities.\n*   The specific injuries found in Ben (hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to eyes/eyelids) are explicitly consistent with violent trauma and inconsistent with typical natural causes.\n*   The specific injuries found in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) are explicitly indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering, making them highly inconsistent with SIDS or other natural causes. A torn frenulum is a particularly strong indicator of trauma.\n\nThe combined probability of all these specific findings occurring by chance due to natural causes, especially the distinctive trauma markers (torn frenulum and retinal hemorrhages) that are explicitly stated to be characteristic of abuse/smothering, is exceedingly low. It is not strictly impossible for medical anomalies to occur, but the constellation of evidence strongly points away from a natural cause of death.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of this specific evidence being present if Jane is NOT GUILTY (i.e., if the deaths were natural) is extremely small.\n\n1",

  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that both children died of natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or other non-homicidal medical events. We need to evaluate the likelihood of the specific set of observations listed in the question under this assumption.\n\nLet's break down each point:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:** The \"injuries found on Ben\" refer primarily to hypoxic damage to the brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids. These are often internal findings discovered during an autopsy or specific medical examination (like an ophthalmoscopic exam for retinal hemorrhages), not typically obvious external signs a nurse would document on admission, especially during resuscitation efforts. Therefore, if Ben died of natural causes, it is quite plausible that these particular internal injuries would not have been noted by nurses at the initial hospital admission. This point is consistent with a natural death scenario.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are tiny red spots often associated with asphyxia or smothering. If Ben died of natural causes, the absence of these specific signs of smothering is entirely consistent and expected. This point strongly supports a natural death scenario.\n\n3.  **The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death:** This statement explicitly provides a natural explanation for a previously noted injury. If Ben died of natural causes, it is highly likely that spinal bleeding would be present, given it is a common finding in such circumstances. This point strongly supports a natural death scenario.\n\n4.  **The dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts:** This statement provides a non-homicidal explanation for another previously noted injury. If Ben died of natural causes and resuscitation attempts were made, or if post-mortem changes occurred, it is very likely that dislocated ribs could be present. This point strongly supports a natural death scenario.\n\n5.  **Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby:** Andy's injuries (bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, blood in lung) were initially described as indicative of abuse. However, this new information provides an alternative, non-abusive explanation. If Andy died of natural causes and resuscitation attempts were made, it is very likely that these injuries could have resulted from such efforts. This point strongly supports a natural death scenario for Andy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the points listed in the question either directly support or are highly consistent with the premise that Jane is NOT GUILTY (i.e., that both children died of natural causes). The new information provides plausible, non-homicidal explanations for most of the physical findings that were previously problematic for a natural death scenario. While the combination of hypoxic brain damage (especially \"hours before death\") and retinal hemorrhages is still a very suspicious finding for natural death *in general*, the question asks about the likelihood of *these specific listed points* being true *given* Jane is NOT GUILTY. These listed points are largely exculpatory or offer benign interpretations. Therefore, the likelihood of these specific circumstances being observed, assuming Jane is NOT GUILTY, is high.\n\n90",
