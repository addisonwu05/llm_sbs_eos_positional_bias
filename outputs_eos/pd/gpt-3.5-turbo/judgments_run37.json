  "Because sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a possible explanation for the deaths of both Andy and Ben, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, occurring in a non-guilty scenario would be approximately 5%. \n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, the likelihood of these similarities between both incidents, including the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, occurring would be approximately 95%.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being consistent with natural death or post-mortem occurrences, and the injuries found in Andy being attributed to resuscitation attempts would be approximately 10%.\n\n100",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the injuries found on Ben not being present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being indicative of intentional harm would be approximately 90%.\n\n100",
