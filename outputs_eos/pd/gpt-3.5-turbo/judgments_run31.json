  "It is very unlikely for all the mentioned similarities and findings to occur by chance in both incidents if Jane is not guilty. Considering the specific details such as the timing of the deaths, the injuries consistent with smothering, and the medical evidence linking both cases, the probability of these occurrences being coincidental would be extremely low.\n\nProbability judgment: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it is highly probable that the similarities between both incidents, including the specific injuries such as the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain, the hemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy's autopsy, would be present.\n\nProbability judgment: 95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as noted by the nurses. The absence of injuries such as petechiae and the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, which are common findings in natural death or post-mortem occurrences, suggest a less suspicious cause of death.\n\nProbability judgment: 20",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, it is highly improbable that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital. The absence of injuries typically associated with smothering, such as petechiae, may not be present in all cases. The presence of dislocated ribs and the injuries found in Andy are more indicative of foul play.\n\nProbability judgment: 80",
  "Based on the given evidence, including the similarities between both incidents, the specific injuries found on both children, the timing and circumstances of the deaths, and the lack of typical injuries associated with smothering, the probability that the defendant is guilty appears high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90",
  "Guilty."
