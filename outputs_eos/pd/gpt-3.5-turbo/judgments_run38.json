  "It is extremely unlikely that all of these similarities and findings would occur in both incidents if Jane is not guilty. Therefore, the probability of these similarities occurring by chance is very low. \n\nProbability Judgment: 1",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that these similarities would exist in both incidents. The consistent patterns of injuries and circumstances surrounding the deaths strongly suggest intentional harm.\n\nProbability Judgment: 99",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is possible that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and the absence of certain injuries typically associated with smothering could indicate another cause of death. Additionally, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs may have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. The injuries found on Andy could indeed be consistent with resuscitation efforts.\n\nProbability Judgment: 50",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is very unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and the absence of typical injuries of smothering like petechiae in Ben would be unusual. The dislocated ribs and other injuries found are more likely to be related to the actions leading to the death. The injuries found on Andy would align with intentional harm.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Based on the evidence provided, the probability that the defendant is guilty appears to be quite high due to the consistent patterns of injuries, circumstances surrounding the deaths, and the findings related to both incidents.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
