  "As a language model AI, I cannot provide a definitive probability as this case involves complex medical and legal issues that would require expertise in forensic pathology and criminal investigation to determine. However, given the similarities between both incidents, the findings of abuse and smothering in Andy's case, and the medical evidence in Ben's case, it is likely that there is a strong correlation between the two incidents. \n\nProbability: 90",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly likely that there would be these similarities between both incidents as abusive behavior towards the children would suggest a pattern of behavior associated with the crimes she is charged with. The presence of consistent injuries and patterns of abuse in both cases would strengthen the prosecution's argument against Jane.\n\nProbability: 95",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is possible that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, especially if they were not noted by the medical staff. The absence of certain injuries like petechiae in Ben could point towards a different cause of death. Additionally, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben may have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy may have been due to resuscitation efforts.\n\nProbability: 80",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is less likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as there would be a higher probability of intentional harm taking place. The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben could be a result of the methods used by Jane to smother the children. The presence of dislocated ribs in Ben could suggest possible trauma inflicted by Jane. Additionally, the injuries found in Andy may also be indicative of intentional harm in both cases.\n\nProbability: 70",
  "Given the complexities and inconsistencies in the evidence provided, it is challenging to determine an exact probability with certainty. However, considering the patterns of injuries, similarities between the incidents involving both children, and the lack of definitive evidence supporting natural causes of death, the likelihood of the defendant being guilty appears significant.\n\nProbability: 80",
  "Based on the evidence presented, the verdict for the defendant is **Guilty**."
