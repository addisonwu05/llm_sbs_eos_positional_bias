  "Based on the similarities between both incidents, the injuries found in Andy's re-examination, and the doctor's claim about the timing of Ben's hypoxic damage, it is highly likely that there would be a strong correlation between Andy and Ben's cases if Jane is NOT GUILTY. \n\nTherefore, the probability of these similarities occurring purely by chance, in the absence of any wrongdoing by Jane, is quite low. \n\nProbability Judgment: 5",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of these similarities occurring between both incidents, including the injuries found in Andy's re-examination and the characteristics of Ben's injuries, would be very high. \n\nGiven the pattern of abusive injuries present in both cases, the timing of the hypoxic damage in Ben's brain, and the specific evidence found in Andy's post-mortem, the probability of these similarities being present due to Jane's guilt is significant.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical injuries of smothering like petechiae, the presence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs as post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, and the injuries found in Andy not being related to abuse but possibly due to resuscitation attempts is moderate.\n\nGiven the lack of documentation by the nurses and the possibility of medical procedures contributing to some of the injuries, the probability is moderately high that these aspects could be true if Jane is not guilty.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the presence of dislocated ribs indicating post-mortem damage, and the injuries found in Andy being related to abuse rather than resuscitation attempts is high.\n\nConsidering the specifics of the injuries found, the lack of initial recognition by nurses, and the potential pattern of abuse, the probability of these aspects being true if Jane is guilty is significant.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85",
  "Based on the evidence presented, including the injuries found on both children, the similarities between the incidents, the timing and nature of the injuries, and the absence of typical signs of natural death, the probability that the defendant is guilty is significant.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90",
  "Guilty"
