Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Their absence suggests the death may not have been caused by smothering.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: The case explicitly states this is \"a common finding in natural death,\" which strongly supports an innocent explanation.\n\n4. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: The case notes these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which provides a clear innocent explanation.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: These were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and are described as \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n\nThe medical evidence seems to have reasonable innocent explanations. SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 births and is more common in boys (both children were male). The timing (11 weeks and 8 weeks) falls within the typical SIDS age range.\n\nThe key supporting factors for innocence include the absence of典型 smothering indicators, the medical explanations provided for most injuries, and the initial medical conclusion of natural causes for Andy's death.\n\n**85**"

Petechiae are common indicators of smothering/asphyxiation. However, they don't always appear in every case of smothering, particularly if the method was brief or if other factors were involved.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If guilty, these could easily be explained as occurring during the murder (from pressure/force) or post-mortem/resuscitation, making this evidence consistent with guilt.\n\n4. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: While described as common in natural death, spinal bleeding can also occur from trauma/force during an assault, so this doesn't exclude guilt.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: If guilty, the injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts could be coincidental - the injuries from the murder might happen to resemble resuscitation injuries, or actual resuscitation could have obscured evidence.\n\nThe main challenge for the guilty scenario is the absence of petechiae, but this alone doesn't make guilt impossible. The other evidence patterns are reasonably consistent with guilt.\n\n**72**"
