Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me evaluate each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Injuries not noted by nurses when Ben was brought to hospital**: If Jane didn't cause harm, this is very likely - nurses wouldn't note injuries that weren't there initially.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This strongly supports innocence, as petechiae are common indicators of smothering. Their absence is highly consistent with natural death.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: The case explicitly states this is \"a common finding in natural death,\" making it very likely under the innocent hypothesis.\n\n4. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: These are described as \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which is entirely consistent with natural death followed by revival efforts.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: These were \"initially put down as due to resuscitation attempts\" and are described as \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This explanation remains plausible under the innocent hypothesis.\n\nAll the physical evidence has alternative explanations that are consistent with natural deaths and subsequent medical intervention. The medical findings that initially seemed suspicious have been contextualized as either common in natural death or likely due to resuscitation efforts.\n\nThe main factor working against the innocent hypothesis is the statistical improbability of two SIDS deaths in one family (roughly 1 in 16 million), but this doesn't change the likelihood of the specific injury patterns observed.\n\n**85**"

However, some injuries from smothering might not be immediately obvious.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This is problematic for the guilty hypothesis. Petechiae are common indicators of smothering/suffocation. Their complete absence makes smothering less likely, though not impossible as smothering doesn't always produce petechiae.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If Jane smothered Ben, chest injuries could result from the force applied. However, the case notes these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which provides an alternative explanation even under the guilty hypothesis.\n\n4. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: While this could potentially result from violent smothering, the case states this is \"common in natural death,\" making it less specifically indicative of murder.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: The torn frenulum and other injuries could be consistent with smothering, but they were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, which remains a plausible explanation even if Jane is guilty.\n\nThe key issue is that if Jane violently smothered both children, we would expect more definitive evidence of smothering (like petechiae) and clearer signs that couldn't be explained by resuscitation efforts.\n\n**25**"
