Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The medical evidence seems more consistent with natural death and post-mortem/resuscitation artifacts rather than intentional harm. The initial medical assessment attributed the injuries to natural processes and medical intervention attempts.\n\nGiven that SIDS affects 1 in 4,000 infants and is more common in boys (both victims were male), and considering the medical explanations provided for all observed injuries, this evidence pattern would be quite likely if Jane were innocent.\n\n85"

Injuries on Ben not being noted by hospital nurses initially - This could happen if the injuries were subtle or if nurses were focused on resuscitation efforts rather than detailed examination. Smothering can sometimes leave minimal external signs.\n\n2. Absence of petechiae in Ben - While petechiae are common in smothering cases, they don't always occur. Some smothering cases present without these typical signs, especially if the method or duration differs.\n\n3. Dislocated ribs in Ben - If Jane used force during smothering (pressing on chest), this could cause rib injuries that might later be attributed to resuscitation attempts, providing cover.\n\n4. Spinal bleeding in Ben - While described as common in natural death, it could also result from violent handling during smothering.\n\n5. Injuries in Andy - If Jane smothered Andy but used a method that left injuries consistent with resuscitation attempts, this would provide perfect cover, explaining why the initial post-mortem suggested natural causes.\n\nIf Jane were guilty and experienced in avoiding detection (having successfully concealed Andy's murder initially), she might have refined her methods to leave minimal obvious evidence while still causing death. The pattern of injuries that can be explained away by medical procedures would actually be quite advantageous for a guilty party.\n\n70"

This represents a consistent modus operandi.\n\n3. Hypoxic brain damage in Ben occurring hours before death - This fits perfectly with smothering, where the perpetrator may have partially suffocated the child, stopped, then resumed later, or the child lingered with brain damage before dying.\n\n4. Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben being \"consistent with smothering and/or violent trauma\" - These are precisely the injuries expected from intentional suffocation.\n\n5.
