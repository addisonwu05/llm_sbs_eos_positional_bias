Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Medical staff focus on life-saving measures, not documenting every potential injury during emergency treatment.\n\n2. **Absence of petechiae in Ben**: This strongly supports innocence, as petechiae are commonly associated with smothering. Their absence suggests the death was not caused by suffocation.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: The evidence states this is \"common in natural death,\" which directly supports the innocence hypothesis.\n\n4. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: These are explicitly noted as \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" again supporting innocence.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: These were \"initially put down as due to resuscitation attempts\" and are \"consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This explanation aligns with innocence.\n\nThe medical evidence actually appears more consistent with natural deaths (possibly SIDS) combined with post-mortem changes and resuscitation artifacts than with intentional harm. The absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is particularly significant.\n\nGiven that SIDS affects 1 in 4,000 infants and is more common in boys (both children were male), and considering that the physical evidence has reasonable innocent explanations, the likelihood of observing this evidence pattern if Jane is not guilty is quite high.\n\n85"

Petechiae are common indicators of suffocation/smothering. Their absence means either the smothering method didn't produce them (possible but less typical) or the death wasn't from smothering.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding in Ben**: While this can occur in natural death, it could also potentially occur during violent shaking or trauma associated with smothering, so it's not inconsistent with guilt.\n\n4. **Dislocated ribs in Ben**: If caused post-mortem or during resuscitation, this again creates a convenient explanation that masks potential evidence of abuse.\n\n5. **Andy's injuries**: If Jane is guilty, having Andy's injuries be perfectly explained by resuscitation attempts is another fortunate coincidence that helped her avoid detection initially.\n\nThe main issue is that if Jane committed murder by smothering, we would expect more definitive evidence of intentional harm - particularly petechiae or other clear signs of suffocation. The pattern where injuries can be reasonably explained by medical intervention rather than abuse, combined with the absence of typical smothering indicators, makes this evidence pattern somewhat unlikely if she is actually guilty.\n\n25"

SIDS does have risk patterns (more common in boys, certain age ranges), and Jane being the primary caregiver would naturally mean she'd be the one to discover them.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage occurring hours before death**: This is very problematic for innocence. If Jane is not guilty, this would require some natural medical condition that caused prolonged oxygen deprivation hours before death, without Jane noticing the baby was in severe distress for hours. This seems highly unlikely.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: These are strongly associated with suffocation/violent trauma. For these to occur naturally would require a very unusual medical condition.\n\n4. **Bruises on arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs in Andy**: A torn frenulum is particularly significant as it's commonly associated with forced feeding or smothering in infants. Multiple bruises combined with internal injuries are very difficult to explain through natural causes or resuscitation alone.\n\nThe combination of these factors - especially the timing of hypoxic damage hours before death, the torn frenulum, multiple bruises, and the remarkable similarities between both deaths - creates a pattern that would be extremely unlikely to occur naturally or coincidentally if Jane is innocent.\n\n5"

A perpetrator would likely follow similar patterns - same methodology, similar timing when alone, targeting vulnerable infants of similar ages. This consistency is exactly what would be expected from deliberate acts by the same person.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage occurring hours before death**: This fits well with guilt. It suggests Ben was subjected to oxygen deprivation (smothering attempt) hours before the final fatal incident, indicating prolonged abuse or multiple episodes of suffocation.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben**: These are classic indicators of suffocation and violent trauma, directly consistent with smothering. This evidence strongly supports the guilt hypothesis.\n\n4. **Bruises on arms/legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs in Andy**: All of these injuries are characteristic of abuse and smothering attempts. The torn frenulum particularly indicates forced trauma to the mouth area, consistent with smothering. Multiple bruises suggest restraint or struggle.\n\n5. **Pattern consistency**: Having similar evidence in both cases (respiratory/hypoxic damage, trauma indicators) creates a clear pattern of repeated violent behavior, which is highly consistent with serial child abuse.\n\nIf Jane is guilty of murdering both children through smothering, this evidence pattern is almost exactly what forensic experts would expect to find - clear indicators of suffocation, signs of struggle/restraint, similar modus operandi, and escalating or repeated abuse patterns.\n\n95"
