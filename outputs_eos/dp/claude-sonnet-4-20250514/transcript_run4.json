Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Let me evaluate each piece of evidence:\n\n**Ben's injuries not noted by nurses:** If the injuries occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts, it's quite plausible that nurses wouldn't have documented them initially, especially if they were subtle or developed after arrival.\n\n**Absence of petechiae in Ben:** This actually supports innocence, as petechiae are commonly associated with smothering. Their absence makes smothering less likely.\n\n**Spinal bleeding in Ben:** The case notes this is \"common in natural death,\" which strongly supports the innocent explanation.\n\n**Dislocated ribs in Ben:** Explicitly stated as \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" again supporting innocence.\n\n**Andy's injuries:** Initially attributed to resuscitation attempts, and the case confirms such injuries \"are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\"\n\nThe evidence pattern shows that most findings have plausible innocent explanations, with some (absence of petechiae, spinal bleeding being common in natural death) actually favoring innocence. The timing and ages of both children (11 weeks and 8 weeks) fall within the typical SIDS age range.\n\nWhile having two infant deaths in one family is statistically uncommon, it's not impossible, and the physical evidence largely aligns with natural death scenarios.\n\n**85**"

Petechiae are classic signs of smothering/asphyxiation and are commonly present in such cases. Their complete absence makes smothering significantly less likely from a medical standpoint.\n\n**Dislocated ribs in Ben:** While these could theoretically result from violent smothering, the case notes they \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" which suggests they're more consistent with medical intervention than assault.\n\n**Spinal bleeding in Ben:** The case specifically states this is \"common in natural death,\" making it an odd finding if this were actually a murder case.\n\n**Andy's injuries:** These were initially deemed consistent with resuscitation attempts and only reinterpreted later. If Jane had violently smothered Andy, we'd expect more definitive evidence of assault rather than injuries easily attributable to medical intervention.\n\nThe overall evidence pattern lacks the clear hallmarks typically seen in infant smothering cases, and several findings actually point away from intentional harm.\n\n**25**"

However, the pattern of Jane being alone in both cases and the timing details create a very specific coincidence.\n\n**Hypoxic brain damage in Ben caused hours before death:** If this were natural death or SIDS, it would be highly unusual for hypoxic damage to occur hours before death without any intervention or medical attention during that timeframe.\n\n**Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben:** While these can sometimes occur in natural death, the combination is more commonly associated with trauma or asphyxiation than with SIDS.\n\n**Andy's injuries upon re-examination:** Bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in lungs are quite specific findings. While initially attributed to resuscitation, a torn frenulum in particular is a concerning injury that's difficult to explain through medical intervention alone.\n\nThe combination of all these factors - the striking similarities between cases, the specific pattern of injuries in both children that are characteristic of abuse/smothering, and the timing of hypoxic damage - creates a very unlikely scenario if Jane is innocent.

Serial offenders often display consistent patterns in their methods and timing.\n\n**Hypoxic brain damage in Ben caused hours before death:** This fits perfectly with intentional smothering - the perpetrator could have attempted smothering, stopped when the child appeared unconscious, then either attempted again later or the child succumbed to the initial damage. This timing is very consistent with deliberate asphyxiation.\n\n**Hypoxic damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben:** These are classic signs of asphyxiation/smothering and would be expected findings if Jane deliberately cut off Ben's oxygen supply.\n\n**Andy's specific injuries:** Bruises to arms and legs (consistent with restraining the child), torn frenulum (often from forced covering of mouth/nose), and blood in lungs (from struggle and oxygen deprivation) are all textbook findings in infant smothering cases.\n\nThe medical evidence aligns almost perfectly with what forensic pathologists would expect to find in deliberate smothering cases. The behavioral pattern (similar circumstances, Jane alone, similar timing) is also highly consistent with intentional acts rather than coincidental natural deaths.\n\n**85**"
