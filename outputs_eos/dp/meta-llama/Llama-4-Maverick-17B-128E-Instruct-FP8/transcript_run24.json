Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Jane is not guilty, we need to analyze the information provided step by step.\n\n1. **Injuries found on Ben not noted by nurses:** If Jane is not guilty, and Ben's death was due to natural causes or SIDS, it's plausible that the injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital or were not noticeable. The fact that they were not noted by nurses could support this, as it suggests the injuries might have occurred post-mortem or were not immediately apparent.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben:** The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben's case could indicate that if Jane were guilty, she might have smothered him in a way that didn't leave these typical signs, or it could genuinely mean that smothering was not the cause of death. If Jane is not guilty, this absence is consistent with a natural death or SIDS.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The information that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts supports the notion that these injuries could be consistent with a natural death or the consequences of medical intervention rather than a sign of foul play.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy:** Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts, which is a plausible explanation if Jane is not guilty. The re-evaluation that found bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could be seen as suspicious, but if Jane is not guilty, these could be considered as either misinterpreted or the result of another cause.\n\nGiven these points, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the described scenario (the injuries not being present or being explained by other factors) hinges on the plausibility of the natural causes or accidental explanations for the observed injuries and the absence of clear signs of smothering.\n\nThe injuries found on Ben not being noted by nurses and the explanations provided for the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs support a natural or accidental cause. The absence of petechiae in Ben is consistent with a non-smothering cause of death. The injuries found in Andy being initially attributed to resuscitation attempts also supports the plausibility of a natural death or accident.\n\nPutting all this together suggests a relatively high likelihood of these observations if Jane is not guilty.\n\n80"

However, this scenario implies that the injuries were either not present when Ben was brought to the hospital or were not noticeable, which could be less likely if Jane had inflicted them before bringing him to the hospital.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben:** The absence of typical signs of smothering could suggest that either Jane was very skilled at smothering without leaving marks, or it wasn't smothering. If Jane is guilty, the lack of typical signs might not be unusual as smothering can sometimes occur without leaving the classic signs.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The fact that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts somewhat mitigates the direct implication of foul play at the time of death, making it somewhat plausible even if Jane is guilty, as it doesn't directly implicate her actions as the cause.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy:** If Jane is guilty, the presence of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy's autopsy re-evaluation could be seen as indicative of previous abuse or smothering, supporting her guilt.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the described scenario occurring involves a mix of plausible and less plausible elements. The absence of petechiae and the explanation for dislocated ribs are plausible. However, the injuries not being noted by nurses is less likely if Jane had smothered Ben before bringing him to the hospital.\n\nThe scenario is somewhat plausible but with elements that make it less clear-cut.\n\n20"

SIDS can occur at any time and is not necessarily correlated with being recently fed, but the similarity in circumstances is unusual. If Jane is not guilty, the probability of such coincidences is low because SIDS deaths are rare (1 in 4,000) and typically do not occur with such similar patterns.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben:** These findings are indicative of smothering or violent trauma.

This could include the age of the babies, the time of day, and the fact that she was alone with them.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben:** These findings are consistent with smothering, which supports the guilt hypothesis.
