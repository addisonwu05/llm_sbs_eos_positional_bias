Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

If Jane is not guilty, this supports the possibility that the injuries could have occurred post-mortem or were not related to her actions.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries on Ben (like petechiae)**: Petechiae are often considered indicative of smothering or asphyxiation. Their absence in Ben's autopsy could imply that smothering might not have been the cause of death, supporting Jane's innocence.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben**: It's mentioned that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This information implies that these injuries might not be indicative of foul play or smothering by Jane.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: The injuries found in Andy were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts. If Jane is not guilty, it's plausible that these injuries, like those in Ben, could be explained by medical procedures or other non-criminal causes.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the observed injuries and their explanations are consistent with her innocence is relatively high. The explanations provided for the injuries on both Andy and Ben (resuscitation attempts, post-mortem occurrence, natural death) offer alternative causes that do not implicate Jane in smothering.\n\nGiven that the injuries can be explained by other factors and that there's an alternative explanation for the deaths (SIDS), and considering the information that counters the smothering hypothesis, the likelihood is relatively high.\n\n80"

However, the fact that they were not noted could also suggest they occurred post-mortem.\n\n2. **Absence of typical smothering injuries (like petechiae) on Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering could indicate that either the smothering did not result in these typical signs or that smothering was not the cause of death. This makes it less likely if we are assuming Jane is guilty of smothering.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben**: If attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling, this doesn't directly relate to Jane's guilt. However, if Jane is guilty and the ribs were dislocated due to her actions, it's less likely that they would be easily explained away as due to resuscitation or post-mortem.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: If Jane is guilty, the fact that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts could indicate that either the injuries were not due to her actions or that they were not easily identifiable as non-accidental.\n\nGiven Jane is guilty, the scenario becomes less likely because:\n- The absence of typical smothering signs in Ben (like petechiae) contradicts the hypothesis of smothering.\n- The injuries found being attributed to other causes (resuscitation, post-mortem) reduces the likelihood that they are evidence of Jane's guilt.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the observed injuries and their explanations would be as described is relatively low because the evidence does not strongly support smothering as the cause of death.\n\n20"

However, the probability of two SIDS deaths in the same family is extremely low.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain caused a matter of hours before death**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could be due to a natural cause or an accident not related to her actions. The timing suggests a significant event occurred before death, but this doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages consistent with smothering/violent trauma**: If Jane is not guilty, these findings could be misinterpreted or have an alternative explanation.

If Jane is not guilty, these findings are difficult to explain without implicating her or someone else in the household.\n\nThe combination of these factors (similarities between incidents, evidence of trauma) makes it highly unlikely that Jane is not guilty because they collectively point towards a non-natural cause of death for both children, and the similarities suggest a pattern.\n\nThe probability of all these factors occurring if Jane is not guilty is low because they are more indicative of a deliberate act rather than natural or accidental causes.\n\n5"

These findings suggest that the deaths may not have been due to natural causes like SIDS.\n\n2. **Similarities Between Incidents**: The similarities between the two incidents (age of the children, time of day, circumstances of discovery) are striking and, if not coincidental, could suggest a pattern of behavior.\n\n3. **Alternative Explanations**: Some initial findings were attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, but subsequent examinations revealed more evidence of potential foul play.\n\n4. **Assessment of Guilt**: Given the evidence of non-accidental injuries in both children and the similarities between the incidents, the likelihood of Jane's guilt is supported. The presence of hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben, along with the bruises and other injuries in Andy, points towards a non-natural cause of death.\n\n5. **Probability Assessment**: The probability judgments provided in the previous responses suggest that if Jane is guilty, the observed evidence (similarities, injuries) is likely (90). Conversely, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of observing this evidence is very low (5).\n\nConsidering these points, and applying Bayes' theorem conceptually, starting with a low prior probability of guilt (since two infant deaths in one family are rare but can occur naturally), the evidence significantly updates the probability towards guilt.\n\n75"
