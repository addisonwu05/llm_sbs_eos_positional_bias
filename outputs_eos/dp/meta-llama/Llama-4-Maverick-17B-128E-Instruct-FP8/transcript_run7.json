Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses could suggest they were not apparent at the time of admission or were not significant enough to be recorded.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering (e.g., petechiae) in Ben supports the notion that his death might not have been due to smothering. Petechiae are often considered indicative of asphyxiation or smothering, though their absence does not rule out such causes entirely.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben**: If these are common in natural deaths or could be attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem changes, this supports the possibility that Ben's death was not due to smothering by Jane. \n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: Initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considered consistent with such attempts, this suggests that Andy's injuries might not be indicative of foul play.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is not guilty, the scenario described (the injuries not being present or being explainable by other factors, absence of typical smothering signs, and alternative explanations for the injuries) becomes more plausible.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and assuming Jane is not guilty (implying the deaths could be due to SIDS or other natural causes), the likelihood of the described scenario is high because it aligns with an alternative explanation for the children's deaths that does not involve Jane's guilt.\n\n80"

However, it's possible that subtle injuries were not immediately noticeable.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering can occur even if smothering was the cause of death. It's not uncommon for such signs to be subtle or not always present.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben being attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem**: If Jane is guilty, the presence of injuries like dislocated ribs could potentially be attributed to the actions of Jane or could be coincidental (due to resuscitation attempts). The fact that they could be explained by resuscitation attempts doesn't directly support or refute Jane's guilt.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy initially attributed to resuscitation attempts**: If Jane is guilty of smothering both children, it's plausible that injuries to Andy were either not recognized or were attributed to other causes initially.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is guilty, the scenario is somewhat less likely because it suggests that the observed injuries and their explanations might not directly support smothering as the cause of death. However, it's still possible that Jane could be guilty even if the injuries were subtle, not immediately recognized, or attributed to other causes.\n\nThe presence of some injuries being explainable by other factors and the absence of certain typical signs of smothering makes the scenario less directly incriminating but does not necessarily rule out Jane's guilt.\n\n20"

SIDS can occur at any time and doesn't necessarily follow a specific pattern, but the similarity in circumstances is unusual.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain being caused a matter of hours before death**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could be due to a natural cause or an unexplained event rather than smothering. The timing suggests a significant event occurred before death, but it doesn't necessarily imply foul play.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma**: If Jane is not guilty, these findings could be coincidental or due to another cause. However, they are also consistent with the prosecution's case that the deaths were due to smothering.\n\n4. **Bruises to the arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: These are indicative of possible abuse or trauma. If Jane is not guilty, these findings are unexpected and suggest that there might be another explanation or perpetrator.\n\nThe combination of these factors, if Jane is not guilty, suggests a series of highly coincidental events or alternative explanations for the findings that do not involve Jane's guilt.
