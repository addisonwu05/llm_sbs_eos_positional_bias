Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses initially supports this, suggesting a possible explanation that the injuries were not present or not observable at the time of admission.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering in Ben could indicate that if Jane were not guilty, the cause of death might not be smothering. This aligns with the defense that the deaths could be due to SIDS.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben being explained by natural causes or resuscitation attempts**: The spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural deaths and the dislocated ribs possibly occurring post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts provide alternative explanations for the observed injuries that do not necessarily implicate Jane.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy being due to resuscitation attempts**: If Andy's injuries were a result of resuscitation attempts, this provides an alternative explanation that doesn't implicate Jane in causing the injuries, supporting the hypothesis that she is not guilty.\n\nConsidering these points together, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the observed conditions (the injuries not being present initially, absence of typical smothering signs, alternative explanations for the injuries found in Ben, and the explanation for Andy's injuries) being true is relatively high because they are consistent with the hypothesis that the deaths were due to natural causes or accidental factors rather than smothering.\n\nGiven the alternative explanations for the injuries and the absence of definitive signs of smothering, it is plausible that these conditions could be true.\n\n80"

The fact that the injuries were not noted by nurses could suggest they were not present or not observable, but this does not directly support Jane's guilt.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering could make it less likely that Jane is guilty of smothering if one expects such signs to be present in cases of smothering. However, the absence of these signs does not necessarily rule out smothering as the cause of death.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben**: The explanation that dislocated ribs occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts reduces the direct implication of Jane's guilt in terms of causing these specific injuries during the act of smothering.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: If Jane is guilty, the fact that Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts might suggest that similar injuries in Ben could also be explained by resuscitation, complicating the interpretation of Jane's guilt based on these injuries alone.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the observed conditions is relatively low because some of the conditions (like the absence of typical smothering signs and the explanation for the injuries) are not strongly supportive of the hypothesis that Jane smothered her children. The lack of clear evidence directly linking Jane to the smothering (such as the absence of petechiae and alternative explanations for the injuries) reduces the likelihood of these conditions being true under the assumption of guilt.\n\n20"
