Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Jane is not guilty, we need to consider the information provided and how it aligns with the possibility of the deaths being due to SIDS or another natural cause rather than smothering.\n\n1. **Injuries found on Ben not being present when brought to the hospital**: If Jane is not guilty and Ben's death was due to SIDS or a natural cause, it is plausible that the injuries found on Ben could have occurred post-mortem or during handling after his arrival at the hospital. This includes the possibility of injuries sustained during resuscitation attempts. The fact that nurses did not note these injuries upon his arrival could suggest they occurred afterward.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of typical signs of smothering (such as petechiae) in Ben could support the hypothesis that his death was not due to smothering. Petechiae are often, but not always, associated with smothering or asphyxiation. Their absence could be seen as consistent with a death not caused by smothering.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben**: The information that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death and that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts supports the idea that these injuries might not be indicative of smothering or foul play. \n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. Further investigation revealed bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung. A torn frenulum is often considered a suspicious injury in infants, as it can be indicative of trauma (such as a blow to the mouth). However, the presence of such injuries does not necessarily prove smothering or murder, as they could potentially be explained by other accidental or natural causes, though this is less likely.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, it implies that both deaths were due to natural causes or accidents not related to her actions. The given details provide some alternative explanations for the injuries found on both babies that do not necessarily imply foul play or smothering by Jane.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the described injuries and their interpretations are consistent with Jane not being guilty (i.e., the deaths being due to SIDS or another natural cause) needs to be assessed based on the plausibility of these explanations.\n\nGiven that SIDS is relatively rare (1 in 4,000) and that the presence of certain injuries (especially in both children) is unusual, the coincidence of such events happening naturally or due to non-suspicious causes in two siblings is extremely low.\n\nTherefore, considering all the points, the probability that the described scenario occurred if Jane is not guilty is relatively low due to the presence of injuries in both children that are not easily explained by SIDS or natural causes alone.\n\n20"

The injuries could have occurred post-mortem or been caused by resuscitation attempts, which aligns with some of the medical explanations provided.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries associated with smothering (like petechiae) in Ben**: The absence of petechiae or other typical signs of smothering in Ben could be seen as somewhat inconsistent with the hypothesis that Ben was smothered, as one might expect to see some signs indicative of asphyxiation. However, the absence of such signs does not definitively rule out smothering.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben**: If Jane is guilty, the dislocated ribs being attributed to resuscitation attempts or post-mortem handling doesn't directly contradict the guilt hypothesis, as it suggests an alternative explanation for the injury.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: The discovery of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy upon re-examination supports the hypothesis that Andy was subjected to some form of trauma or abuse, which is consistent with the possibility that Jane was guilty of smothering or harming him.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, the scenario that the injuries were not all directly related to her actions (e.g., some being due to resuscitation or post-mortem handling) is plausible. However, the absence of typical smothering signs in Ben and the alternative explanations for some injuries slightly complicate the straightforward interpretation of guilt based on the initial findings.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Jane is guilty, the probability that the described scenario (injuries not being present, absence of typical smothering signs, alternative explanations for some injuries) occurred is relatively plausible because it involves a mix of potential guilt indicators (some injuries) and factors that could either support or complicate that interpretation (absence of certain signs, alternative explanations for injuries).\n\n40"

However, such coincidences are extremely rare, especially given that SIDS is already a rare event (1 in 4,000).\n\n2. **Injuries found in Andy and Ben indicative of abuse or smothering**: The presence of bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy, and hypoxic damage to Ben's brain along with haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, are serious indicators of potential abuse or smothering. If Jane is not guilty, these findings need an alternative explanation that is unrelated to her actions.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain caused a matter of hours before death**: This indicates that Ben suffered from a lack of oxygen a matter of hours before his death, which is consistent with smothering or another form of asphyxiation.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the probability of these specific and serious indicators of potential smothering or abuse occurring in both children is extremely low, as it would imply a highly improbable coincidence of natural or accidental causes that mimic the signs of smothering in two siblings.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially the rare occurrence of SIDS in the first place, the similarities between the two incidents, and the presence of injuries indicative of abuse or smothering—makes the scenario highly unlikely if Jane is not guilty.\n\n1"
