Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

The fact that nurses did not note the injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital could suggest this, making it plausible.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries of smothering in Ben (like petechiae)**: The absence of typical signs associated with smothering (such as petechiae) in Ben supports the notion that Ben might not have died from smothering, aligning with Jane's innocence.\n\n3. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben**: The information suggests that spinal bleeding is a common finding in natural death, and dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This implies that these injuries or conditions could be explained by factors other than smothering, supporting the possibility that Jane is not guilty.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: Initially, Andy's injuries were attributed to resuscitation attempts. The later discovery of bruises, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung could suggest non-accidental injury. However, if Jane is not guilty, one would have to consider alternative explanations for these findings, such as misinterpretation or other accidental causes.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that:\n- The injuries on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, as they could have occurred post-mortem.\n- The absence of petechiae supports the idea that Ben was not smothered.\n- The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben could be due to natural death or resuscitation attempts/post-mortem handling.\n- The injuries found in Andy could be due to other reasons or misinterpretation.\n\nGiven the explanations provided for the injuries and the condition of the babies, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the given conditions (injuries not present when Ben was brought to the hospital, absence of typical smothering injuries in Ben, the nature of Ben's injuries, and the injuries found in Andy having alternative explanations) is relatively high.\n\n80"

However, it's possible that the injuries were not noticed by the nurses.\n\n2. **Absence of typical injuries of smothering in Ben (like petechiae)**: If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, the absence of typical signs like petechiae is somewhat unexpected, as these are often associated with asphyxiation. However, the absence does not necessarily rule out smothering, as not all cases present with such signs.\n\n3. **Dislocated ribs found in Ben**: If Jane is guilty, the presence of dislocated ribs could be seen as supporting evidence if attributed to her actions. However, the information suggests that dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts, which complicates the interpretation.\n\n4. **Injuries found in Andy**: If Jane is guilty, the presence of injuries in Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) upon re-examination supports the notion that she could have been responsible for Andy's death as well, potentially through smothering or other forms of abuse.\n\nGiven Jane's guilt, the likelihood of:\n- The injuries on Ben not being noticed by nurses is plausible but less likely if they were significant and related to the cause of death.\n- The absence of typical smothering signs in Ben is possible but not necessarily expected.\n- The dislocated ribs being due to other causes (like resuscitation or post-mortem) is plausible.\n- The injuries in Andy supporting a similar cause or manner of death.\n\nThe combination of these factors, given Jane's guilt, makes some of the observations (like the absence of petechiae) less likely but still within the realm of possibility due to the complexities and variability in presentation of infant smothering.\n\n20"

SIDS or natural causes could potentially explain the deaths, but the similarities might strain credulity.\n\n2. **Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain caused a matter of hours before death**: If Jane is not guilty, the hypoxic damage could be attributed to other causes or conditions not related to smothering, but the timing suggested (a matter of hours before death) is consistent with an acute event. However, attributing this to an innocent cause is challenging if it's associated with smothering or trauma.\n\n3. **Hypoxic damage and haemorrhages consistent with smothering/trauma**: If Jane is not guilty, then these findings need alternative explanations. While possible, it's less likely that such specific and severe conditions are due to natural causes or accidents, especially if they are strongly associated with smothering or trauma.\n\n4. **Bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy**: If Jane is not guilty, these signs indicative of abuse or smothering need alternative explanations, which is challenging.\n\nConsidering the above points, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these observations is low because they strongly suggest a non-natural cause of death that is difficult to attribute to coincidence or natural causes, especially given the similarities between the two deaths.\n\n5"
