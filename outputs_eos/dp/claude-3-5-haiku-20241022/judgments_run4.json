  "Let's carefully analyze the key points:\n\n1. Ben's injuries (spinal bleeding, dislocated ribs) were:\n- Noted not to be unusual for natural death or post-mortem changes\n- Not observed by nurses during initial hospital examination\n- Lacked typical smothering indicators like petechiae\n\n2. Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts and considered consistent with life-saving efforts\n\n3. SIDS is a known phenomenon:\n- Occurs in 1 in 4,000 infants\n- More common in boys\n- No clear mechanism understood\n\n4. Two infant deaths in the same family is statistically rare but not impossible\n\n5. The medical evidence provides reasonable alternative explanations for the injuries and deaths that do not necessarily imply intentional harm\n\nConsidering the medical uncertainties, the lack of definitive evidence of intentional harm, the plausible alternative explanations, and the potential for natural causes or medical misunderstandings, the probability that Jane is NOT GUILTY appears substantive.\n\nThe medical testimony suggests significant reasonable doubt about intentional murder.\n\nProbability of Jane being NOT GUILTY: 85",
  "Let's analyze the key points from a perspective of potential guilt:\n\n1. Two infant deaths in the same family is extremely statistically unlikely by natural causes:\n- Probability of SIDS is 1 in 4,000\n- Two sequential infant deaths suggests potential deliberate intervention\n\n2. Ben's medical findings suggest potential non-natural causes:\n- Spinal bleeding\n- Dislocated ribs\n- Injuries not initially noted by medical staff could indicate deliberate concealment\n\n3. Subsequent investigation of Andy's case revealed previously undetected injuries:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n\n4. The pattern of injuries across both children suggests a potential consistent mechanism of harm\n\n5. The absence of typical smothering indicators (like petechiae) does not definitively rule out intentional harm, as forensic techniques and evidence can vary\n\n6. The medical complexities and subtle indicators suggest a nuanced interpretation of evidence\n\nConsidering the statistical improbability of two infant deaths, the pattern of injuries, and the subsequent forensic findings, the likelihood of guilt appears significant.\n\nProbability of Jane being GUILTY: 75",
  "Let's systematically analyze these new details:\n\n1. Striking similarities between both incidents:\n- Both babies around same age (8-11 weeks)\n- Died at similar time of day after feeding\n- Both found unconscious by Jane when alone with them\n- This level of consistency is extremely improbable by chance\n\n2. Medical evidence specifics:\n- Hypoxic brain damage to Ben caused hours before death\n- Specific bruising patterns in Andy:\n  * Bruises to arms and legs\n  * Torn frenulum\n  * Blood in lung\n- Ben's specific injuries:\n  * Hypoxic brain damage\n  * Haemorrhages in eyes and eyelids\n\n3. These medical findings are:\n- Highly specific\n- Consistent with smothering\n- Indicate deliberate, intentional trauma\n- Remarkably similar across two separate incidents\n\n4. Statistical probability of such identical circumstances occurring naturally is vanishingly small\n\n5. The pattern suggests a deliberate, repeated method of infant harm\n\nConsidering the extraordinary similarities, the specific medical evidence, and the improbability of such coincidental occurrences, the likelihood of these findings happening by pure chance is extremely low.\n\nProbability of these similarities occurring if Jane is NOT GUILTY: 5",
  "Analyzing the evidence through a guilt perspective:\n\n1. Similarities between incidents:\n- Both babies same age (8-11 weeks)\n- Died at similar time of day after feeding\n- Found unconscious by Jane when alone\n- Extremely precise and consistent pattern\n\n2. Medical evidence correlations:\n- Ben's hypoxic brain damage caused hours before death\n- Specific, consistent injury patterns across both children:\n  * Bruises to arms and legs\n  * Torn frenulum\n  * Blood in lung\n  * Haemorrhages in eyes/eyelids\n- These injuries are medically characteristic of smothering\n- Remarkable consistency suggests deliberate, repeated method of harm\n\n3. Statistical improbability of such identical circumstances occurring naturally:\n- Virtually impossible to occur by chance\n- Precise medical and circumstantial similarities\n- Suggests systematic, intentional action\n\n4. Each piece of evidence independently and collectively points toward deliberate harm\n\n5. The level of consistency across both incidents strongly indicates a deliberate pattern of infanticide\n\nConsidering the extraordinary medical and circumstantial similarities, the specificity of injuries, and the overwhelming consistency, these findings are overwhelmingly likely if Jane is guilty.\n\nProbability of these similarities occurring if Jane is GUILTY: 95",
  "Analyzing the comprehensive evidence:\n\n1. Statistically Improbable Factors:\n- Two infant deaths in same family\n- Remarkably similar circumstances\n- Both children died when alone with Jane\n- Consistent timing and conditions of deaths\n\n2. Medical Evidence:\n- Specific, characteristic injuries consistent with smothering\n- Bruising patterns\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n- Blood and hemorrhage findings\n- Injuries not explained by natural causes or resuscitation\n\n3. Pattern of Incidents:\n- First death initially attributed to natural causes\n- Second death revealed more extensive forensic evidence\n- Systematic similarities across both incidents\n\n4. Forensic Indicators:\n- Bruises to arms and legs\n- Torn frenulum\n- Blood in lung\n- Haemorrhages to eyes and eyelids\n- Hypoxic brain damage\n\n5. Probability Assessment:\n- Extremely low likelihood of coincidental deaths\n- Strong forensic evidence pointing to deliberate harm\n- Consistent pattern across both incidents\n\nConsidering the cumulative weight of medical, statistical, and circumstantial evidence, the probability of guilt appears overwhelmingly high.\n\nProbability of Guilt: 90",
  "Based on the comprehensive review of evidence, including:\n\n1. Two infant deaths in identical circumstances\n2. Remarkably consistent medical findings across both cases\n3. Specific injuries characteristic of smothering\n4. Statistically improbable natural occurrence of such deaths\n5. Forensic evidence indicating deliberate trauma\n6. Pattern of injuries and circumstances highly suggestive of intentional harm\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a systematic pattern of infanticide.\n\nVerdict: Guilty"
