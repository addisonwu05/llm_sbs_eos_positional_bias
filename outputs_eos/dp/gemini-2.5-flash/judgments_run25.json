  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, meaning the deaths were not due to smothering but rather natural causes or complications from resuscitation attempts, we evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that \"The dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts would occur after the baby is brought to the hospital (or in the ambulance/at home, but certainly *after* the initial discovery of the baby's condition). If these injuries occurred during resuscitation, they would not have been present upon arrival. This makes it highly likely that at least some of the injuries were not present upon arrival.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Ben was not smothered. Therefore, the *absence* of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is highly consistent with, and expected in, a scenario where Jane is innocent.\n\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text directly states that \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these explanations (natural death, post-mortem changes, or resuscitation) are the alternatives to murder. Therefore, the presence of these findings is explicitly stated to be likely under the \"not guilty\" hypothesis.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, Andy died of natural causes, and resuscitation attempts would have been made. Therefore, the presence of these injuries is consistent with, and likely given, the resuscitation efforts.\n\nIn summary, all the listed pieces of evidence are either directly explained as common occurrences in natural death or during resuscitation attempts (consistent with innocence), or their absence actively contradicts the prosecution's claim of smothering (also consistent with innocence). Therefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is very likely that this specific combination of evidence would be observed.\n\n92",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, meaning she murdered her children by smothering them, we need to assess the likelihood of the described evidence:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states that dislocated ribs \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Resuscitation attempts would occur after the baby was found unresponsive and medical help called. Thus, if Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would still have been made, and any injuries resulting from these attempts would likely not have been present when he was first brought to the hospital. This is a very likely scenario even if Jane is guilty.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, and petechiae are considered \"typical\" injuries for this cause of death, then the *absence* of such typical injuries makes this specific presentation less likely than if petechaie were present. While not impossible (as \"typical\" doesn't mean \"always\"), it means this is an atypical presentation of smothering.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text indicates these \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would have been made, or post-mortem changes would have occurred. Therefore, the presence of dislocated ribs, explained by these factors, is likely even if Jane is guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states that Andy's injuries \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have been made, and the presence of these injuries would be a likely outcome.\n\nIn summary, three out of the four points of evidence (injuries not present on arrival, dislocated ribs in Ben, and injuries in Andy) are highly likely to occur even if Jane is guilty, as they are explained by resuscitation efforts which would happen regardless of the cause of death. However, the critical factor is the \"absence of injuries such as petechiae\" which are described as \"typical\" for smothering. If smothering occurred, the absence of a typical sign makes this particular observation less probable than if the typical sign *were* present.\n\nConsidering that a \"typical\" sign of smothering is absent, it makes this specific constellation of evidence less probable than a case where typical signs *were* present. While the other evidence is likely, the absence of petechiae significantly lowers the overall probability of this exact scenario occurring if Jane is guilty of smothering. It suggests an atypical presentation of the crime.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, meaning the deaths were due to natural causes or accidental/resuscitation events not caused by her, we assess the likelihood of the given evidence:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** While statistically remarkable for two infants to die at similar ages, times, and circumstances (especially being alone with Jane), certain patterns (like SIDS often occurring during sleep after feeding, and parents being alone with infants during such events) mean these similarities are not entirely impossible under a natural death hypothesis, though they remain \"astonishing.\"\n\n2.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** If Ben died of natural causes (e.g., severe infection, cardiac event, respiratory failure), a period of hypoxia leading to death over hours is medically plausible.\n\n3.  **Hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma:** This statement presents a significant challenge to the \"not guilty\" hypothesis. While hypoxic damage can occur in natural deaths, and some haemorrhages can have non-traumatic causes, the explicit statement that these findings are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma\" suggests a strong association with non-natural causes. If Jane is innocent, these injuries would have to stem from rare natural events or be misinterpretations, making their presence less likely.\n\n4.  **Bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering:** This is the most critical piece of evidence against Jane's innocence. If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then Andy was not abused or smothered by her. The presence of injuries *explicitly described* as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" would be extremely unlikely under an innocence hypothesis. It would imply either a severe medical misinterpretation of natural/resuscitation injuries or an incredibly rare natural event that perfectly mimicked abuse. Given the strong forensic language used, the probability of these specific findings existing if Jane is innocent is very low.\n\nConsidering points 3 and 4, which describe injuries as consistent with or indicative of smothering/abuse, their presence significantly lowers the overall probability of this evidence occurring if Jane is truly not guilty. While points 1 and 2 are more plausible under natural causes, the forensic characterization of the injuries in both children directly contradicts the premise of innocence. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this combination of evidence, as described and interpreted, would be found if Jane were not guilty.\n\n5",
