  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering her children, we need to assess the likelihood of the following observations:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane smothered Ben, the injuries (such as hypoxic brain damage and eye haemorrhages) would have been present when he was brought to the hospital. Nurses in an emergency resuscitation scenario might plausibly miss or not fully document all injuries, especially internal ones or subtle external ones. However, significant visible injuries like eye haemorrhages might be expected to be noted. This makes it somewhat less likely, but still possible, that *all* injuries would go unnoted.\n2.  **Absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are considered a \"typical\" sign of death due to smothering or asphyxia. If Jane is guilty of smothering, the absence of this typical sign makes the specific set of observations less characteristic of smothering. While smothering does not *always* result in petechiae, their absence is less likely than their presence given a smothering death.\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts:** If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, this finding is consistent with her guilt. Smothering does not necessarily cause dislocated ribs, and it is plausible that these specific injuries arose from resuscitation efforts or post-mortem handling. Thus, this observation does not contradict the \"guilty\" hypothesis and is reasonably likely to occur even if she is guilty.\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy (bruises to arms/legs, torn frenulum, blood in the lung):** If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, these injuries could be consistent with a struggle during the act of smothering or from the smothering itself (e.g., torn frenulum from covering the mouth). They are also consistent with resuscitation attempts. Therefore, the presence of these injuries is quite likely if Jane is guilty.\n\n**Overall assessment if Jane is GUILTY:**\n\nThe overall likelihood of this combination of observations, given that Jane is guilty, is a complex judgment. The presence of injuries in Andy and the explanation for Ben's dislocated ribs are quite consistent with guilt. However, the absence of typical smothering signs like petechiae in Ben, and the fact that Ben's injuries were not noted by nurses (implying they were either subtle or missed despite potentially being significant), make this specific set of observations less straightforwardly supportive of a smothering death. These latter points weaken the \"guilty\" hypothesis compared to a scenario where typical signs were present and/or injuries were clearly observed upon arrival.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability is diminished by the less typical nature of the findings concerning Ben's injuries and the lack of petechiae.\n\n20",
