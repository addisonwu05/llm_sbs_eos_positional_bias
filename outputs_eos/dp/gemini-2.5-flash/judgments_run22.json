  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that the deaths of Andy and Ben were due to natural causes (such as SIDS) or other non-criminal factors, and that any injuries observed were either natural consequences of death or resulted from resuscitation attempts. Let's evaluate each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Ben's injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital / not noted by nurses:** If injuries like dislocated ribs occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation attempts (as the text states), or if internal injuries were not immediately apparent, it is highly likely that they would not have been noted by nurses at the initial presentation. This is consistent with a natural death followed by emergency medical intervention.\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are typical signs of smothering. If Jane is not guilty, then smothering did not occur. Therefore, the absence of petechiae is exactly what would be expected, making this observation highly likely if Jane is innocent.\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text explicitly states that \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death\" and \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" Both of these explanations are highly consistent with Ben having died from natural causes and subsequently undergoing emergency resuscitation.\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text clarifies that \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This directly explains Andy's injuries as a consequence of medical intervention, which would occur regardless of Jane's guilt or innocence, assuming a natural death necessitated resuscitation.\n\nAll the specific pieces of evidence mentioned in the question are either directly stated to be consistent with natural death or resuscitation efforts, or are expected findings if Jane is not guilty (e.g., absence of smothering signs). Therefore, the likelihood of these combined observations occurring, given that Jane is NOT GUILTY, is very high.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering her children, we need to assess the likelihood of each piece of evidence:\n\n1.  **Ben's injuries were not present when he was brought to the hospital / not noted by nurses:** If Jane smothered Ben, the internal injuries (hypoxic damage, haemorrhages to eyes and eyelids, rib and spinal cord injuries) would have been present upon admission, but these are primarily internal or subtle. The text also states that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If they occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation, they would not have been present *when he was brought to the hospital* and thus not noted by nurses at that initial stage. Therefore, it is moderately likely that nurses would not have noted all internal or post-resuscitation injuries immediately.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text explicitly states that \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering, and petechiae are *typical* injuries for such a death, then the *absence* of this typical sign makes this observation less likely under the assumption of guilt. While smothering can occur without petechiae, their absence is a counter-indicator to the \"guilty of smothering\" hypothesis.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would certainly have been made. Therefore, dislocated ribs resulting from resuscitation are highly likely to occur even if Jane is guilty.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similar to Ben, if Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have followed, making such injuries highly likely regardless of guilt.\n\nCombining these points: The absence of petechiae (a typical sign of smothering) significantly reduces the overall likelihood of observing this specific set of evidence if Jane is guilty of smothering. While the other points (injuries not noted by nurses, dislocated ribs, and Andy's injuries) can be explained by resuscitation efforts, which would happen in any case of infant death, the missing \"typical\" sign of smothering is a strong inconsistency with the guilt hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of all these observations occurring together, given that Jane is GUILTY of smothering, is relatively low due to the absence of a typical indicator of the alleged crime.\n\n25",
