  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that her children, Andy and Ben, died of natural causes or accidents, and not by her act of smothering. We need to assess the likelihood of the described evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\"**: The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Ben died naturally, or if the injuries developed post-mortem or were caused by resuscitation efforts *after* arrival or during initial treatment, it would be entirely plausible that nurses would not have noted them at the time he was brought in. This fact is therefore consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane did not smother Ben, then the absence of these typical smothering injuries is highly consistent with her innocence.\n\n3.  **\"the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text provides direct explanations that align with innocence: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" These findings are explicitly stated to be likely under a scenario of natural death or resuscitation, which is consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\n4.  **\"and the injuries found in Andy\"**: Andy's injuries (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) are also explained away in the text: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" This makes the presence of these injuries highly likely even if Andy died of natural causes and Jane is not guilty.\n\nIn summary, all the pieces of evidence mentioned are either directly explained as common in natural death, consistent with resuscitation attempts, or represent the *absence* of evidence that would point to guilt (like the lack of petechiae). Therefore, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly likely that these specific findings would be observed.\n\n98",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of smothering her children, we need to assess the likelihood of observing the specific set of evidence described:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\"**: The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Jane smothered Ben, he would have sustained the internal injuries (ribs, spinal cord, brain hypoxic damage, eye haemorrhages) prior to arrival. However, it's plausible that nurses, during an emergency and focusing on resuscitation, might not immediately detect or document these internal injuries, which often require an autopsy to fully identify. So, this observation (that they were not noted) is reasonably likely even if Jane is guilty.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: The text states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane smothered Ben, and petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering,\" then the *absence* of this typical sign makes it *less likely* that smothering occurred. Therefore, if Jane *is* guilty of smothering, the observation that petechiae were absent is a finding that goes against the typical presentation and thus reduces the likelihood of this specific evidence set under the assumption of guilt.\n\n3.  **\"the dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text notes that \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane smothered Ben, resuscitation attempts would have followed. Thus, the occurrence of dislocated ribs due to resuscitation efforts is highly likely and consistent with Jane being guilty.\n\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\"**: Andy's injuries (bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, blood in the lung) were found upon re-examination of autopsy photos and subsequently led to the murder charge. These injuries, whether directly caused by the act of smothering or by subsequent resuscitation attempts, are consistent with a scenario where Jane smothered Andy. If she is guilty, it is reasonably likely that such injuries would be present and eventually discovered.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe most significant factor reducing the likelihood of this evidence set, given Jane's guilt, is the **absence of petechiae in Ben**. If smothering is the cause of death and petechiae are considered \"typical\" injuries, their absence makes this specific observation less probable under the guilt hypothesis. While the other observations (nurses not noting injuries, dislocated ribs, Andy's injuries) are generally consistent with guilt (especially considering resuscitation efforts would follow smothering), the lack of a \"typical\" indicator for the primary crime significantly lowers the overall probability. It suggests that if she *were* guilty of smothering, this particular collection of findings would be somewhat atypical.\n\n35",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it implies that both children died of natural causes (e.g., SIDS) or accidents, and Jane did not harm them. We need to assess the likelihood of the described evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **\"the similarities between both incidents are astonishing: both babies were about the same age when they died; they both died at similar time of the day after just being fed; and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\"**\n    *   If both deaths were natural (e.g., SIDS), the likelihood of *two* such deaths in one family is extremely low, and the probability of them occurring with such a striking pattern of similarities (age, time, discovery by the same person when alone) by pure chance is even lower. While individual elements (babies found by caregiver, put to bed after feeding) are plausible in natural deaths, their repetition in an \"astonishing\" manner significantly strains the credibility of a \"not guilty\" scenario driven by natural causes.\n\n2.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death\"**\n    *   If Ben died naturally (e.g., from a sudden medical event leading to respiratory or cardiac arrest), it is plausible that a period of oxygen deprivation could have occurred prior to death, lasting \"a matter of hours,\" as the body's systems shut down. This specific timing is not inherently inconsistent with a natural death.\n\n3.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids\"**\n    *   While hypoxic damage can result from any process leading to severe oxygen deprivation (including natural causes), haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are often considered strong indicators of traumatic asphyxia, such as smothering. Although they can occur in some natural deaths (e.g., extreme coughing, severe vomiting, or prolonged oxygen deprivation), they are far less common in typical SIDS or other natural infant deaths compared to their presence in cases of non-accidental trauma. Therefore, finding these injuries makes a natural death less likely.\n\n4.  **\"the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy\"**\n    *   The previous context explicitly stated: \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Andy died naturally and Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that resuscitation attempts were made, and these types of injuries would be a common consequence. This point is very consistent with Jane being not guilty.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nWhile Andy's injuries are well-explained by resuscitation in a \"not guilty\" scenario, the \"astonishing similarities\" of two infant deaths occurring under such specific and repeated circumstances, coupled with the suspicious nature of Ben's eye haemorrhages (which lean away from natural causes), significantly reduces the overall likelihood of this *combination* of evidence if Jane is truly not guilty. The cumulative effect of these points, especially the statistical improbability of two \"astonishingly similar\" natural infant deaths with trauma-suggestive findings, makes it quite unlikely.\n\n15",
