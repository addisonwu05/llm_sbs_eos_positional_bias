  "Given that Jane is NOT GUILTY, we assess the likelihood of each piece of evidence as follows:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\"**: The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If these injuries were internal, subtle, or occurred during/after resuscitation or post-mortem (as suggested for dislocated ribs), it is highly likely they would not be immediately evident or present upon hospital admission. This is consistent with innocence.\n\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: The text explicitly states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means Ben was not smothered. Therefore, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is highly expected and consistent with her innocence.\n\n3.  **\"the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben\"**: The text provides clear alternative explanations: \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" These explanations directly support a non-guilty scenario for Jane, as they attribute the injuries to natural causes, post-mortem changes, or resuscitation efforts rather than inflicted harm.\n\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\"**: The text explains, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY and Andy died of natural causes, then it is highly likely that resuscitation attempts would cause such injuries. This explanation is fully consistent with her innocence.\n\nAll the points of evidence are presented with strong, exculpatory explanations within the problem description itself. These explanations make the observed findings highly plausible under the assumption that Jane is not guilty and that the children died from natural causes (such as SIDS), with some injuries being a result of resuscitation attempts or post-mortem processes. Therefore, if Jane is indeed NOT GUILTY, it is very likely that these pieces of evidence and their provided explanations are true.\n\n90",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered her children and inflicted injuries upon them. We need to assess the likelihood of the given statements being true under this assumption:\n\n1.  **\"the injuries found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital\"**: Even if Jane inflicted injuries, it's plausible that internal injuries, subtle bruises, or those focused on in a chaotic emergency situation might not be immediately noted by nurses. This statement doesn't strongly contradict guilt.\n2.  **\"the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\"**: Petechiae are considered a typical, though not universal, sign of smothering due to increased venous pressure. If Jane smothered Ben, the absence of this typical sign makes the scenario less likely.\n3.  **\"the dislocated ribs found in Ben probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts\"**: If Jane is guilty of smothering and inflicting rib injuries, then the *true cause* of those injuries would be her actions. Therefore, it is less likely that the alternative explanation (post-mortem or resuscitation attempts) is the *actual* cause for the dislocated ribs that raised suspicion. This statement, if true, contradicts the idea that Jane caused the suspicious rib injuries.\n4.  **\"the injuries found in Andy\" (which \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby\")**: Similarly, if Jane is guilty of smothering Andy and inflicting his injuries, then the *true cause* of his injuries would be her actions. It is less likely that the alternative explanation (resuscitation attempts) is the *actual* cause of the suspicious injuries that were later re-evaluated. This statement, if true, contradicts the idea that Jane caused Andy's injuries.\n\nIn summary, if Jane is guilty:\n*   The absence of a typical sign of smothering (petechiae) is less likely.\n*   The existence of plausible alternative, non-culpable explanations for the specific suspicious injuries (Ben's ribs, Andy's injuries) is less likely to be the *actual truth* if Jane caused those injuries.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these facts — especially the absence of typical smothering signs and the presence of strong alternative explanations for inflicted injuries — makes this scenario less probable if Jane is indeed guilty. It would require unusual circumstances where typical evidence is missing, and/or the actual causes of injuries were consistently misattributed to non-culpable factors.\n\n5",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that the children died of natural causes (such as SIDS), and any injuries were either naturally occurring or a result of resuscitation attempts. We need to assess the likelihood of the given statements being true under this assumption.\n\n1.  **\"the similarities between both incidents are astonishing: both babies were about the same age when they died; they both died at similar time of the day after just being fed; and they were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\"** While two SIDS deaths in a family are rare (though the risk is higher if there's one SIDS death), the *specific pattern* of death (age, time, discovery by parent alone) being so similar and \"astonishing\" is often a red flag in cases of repeated inflicted harm. If both deaths were genuinely natural, such \"astonishing\" similarities would be a highly unusual coincidence.\n2.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death.\"** Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as \"sudden and unexplainable.\" If severe hypoxic damage occurred \"a matter of hours before death,\" it suggests a prolonged process of decline or an explainable cause, which is less consistent with the \"sudden and unexplainable\" nature of SIDS.\n3.  **\"the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\"** If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these injuries must have occurred naturally or during resuscitation. However, the text explicitly states they are \"consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" While some components (e.g., hypoxia from terminal events) might occur naturally, the *combination* of severe hypoxic damage and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, described as \"consistent with smothering,\" makes it significantly less likely that these specific findings would be present if the death was genuinely natural and non-violent.\n4.  **\"The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"** This statement directly conflicts with earlier information that \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, then the re-examination's conclusion that these injuries are \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" must be incorrect. It is unlikely that genuinely natural or resuscitation-related injuries would be definitively re-interpreted by experts as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\"\n\nIn summary, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, then a significant portion of these findings, particularly the strong expert interpretations linking the injuries to smothering and abuse, would have to be either extraordinary natural coincidences that perfectly mimic abuse, or severe misinterpretations by medical professionals. The combined weight of \"astonishing\" similarities between deaths and specific injuries explicitly described as \"consistent with smothering\" or \"indicative of abuse\" makes the scenario very unlikely under the assumption of innocence.\n\n20",
