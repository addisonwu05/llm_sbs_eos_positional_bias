  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered both her children. Let's evaluate the likelihood of each specified detail occurring under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The text states, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Jane smothered Ben, he would have suffered internal injuries (hypoxic damage to the brain, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, spinal cord injuries) that might not be immediately visible or noted by emergency staff focused on resuscitation. The dislocated ribs are also stated to \"probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts,\" meaning they might not have been present or apparent upon arrival. This scenario is highly plausible.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are described as \"typical injuries of a death due to smothering.\" If Jane is guilty, the absence of a typical sign makes this specific case of smothering less common, but not impossible. \"Typical\" implies they are usually present, but not universally. It's plausible that a certain percentage of smothering cases do not manifest petechiae. While their absence is a less common outcome, it's a known variation.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering Ben, resuscitation attempts would have been made. Therefore, this finding is highly consistent with the guilt hypothesis.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** Andy's injuries (bruises to arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the lung) \"had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is guilty of smothering Andy, resuscitation attempts would have been made. This finding is therefore highly consistent with the guilt hypothesis.\n\n**Summary of Likelihoods given GUILTY:**\n*   Nurses not noting Ben's injuries upon arrival: High likelihood.\n*   Dislocated ribs in Ben due to resuscitation: Very high likelihood.\n*   Andy's injuries due to resuscitation: Very high likelihood.\n*   Absence of petechiae in Ben: Lower likelihood, as petechiae are typical, but not impossible.\n\nThe overall likelihood of these combined observations, given Jane's guilt, is a balance. Most points align very well with the guilt hypothesis (as they are direct consequences or plausible explanations). The primary factor reducing the likelihood from certainty is the absence of petechiae, which implies this was an atypical case of smothering in that specific regard. However, the severe internal injuries found on Ben are still highly indicative of smothering, and the other points are well-explained.\n\nTaking into account that most elements are highly consistent, while the absence of petechiae represents a less common but plausible variation, the overall probability is diminished but remains moderate to high.\n\n75",
