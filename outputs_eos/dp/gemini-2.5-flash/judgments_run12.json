  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means that her children died from natural causes (e.g., SIDS) or from accidental causes unrelated to her actions (e.g., resuscitation attempts). Let's evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** The statement explicitly says, \"The injuries that were found on Ben were not noted by nurses when he was brought to the hospital.\" If Ben's death was natural or involved resuscitation, it is plausible that internal injuries or those caused during resuscitation would not be externally visible or immediately apparent to nurses upon arrival. This observation is highly consistent with Jane's innocence.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" If Jane is not guilty, then Ben was not smothered. Therefore, the absence of petechiae, which are typical signs of smothering, is precisely what one would expect to find. This strongly supports Jane's innocence.\n\n3.  **The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text explicitly states, \"The spinal bleeding that was found in Ben is a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" These explanations directly align with a non-homicidal cause of death. If Jane is not guilty, these findings are highly likely to be true.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text notes, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" If Jane is not guilty, then Andy's death was natural, and any injuries found were due to non-homicidal causes like resuscitation efforts. This explanation is highly consistent with Jane's innocence.\n\nAll four points are either explicitly stated to be consistent with natural death, resuscitation attempts, or the *absence* of typical homicidal signs, all of which support the hypothesis that Jane is NOT GUILTY. Therefore, if Jane is innocent, it is very highly probable that these particular facts would be observed.\n\n95",
  "If Jane is GUILTY, it means she smothered her children. We need to evaluate the likelihood of each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital:** If Jane smothered Ben, the injuries could be internal (hypoxic damage, spinal bleeding, eye haemorrhages) or not immediately apparent externally. It's plausible that nurses might not note them upon arrival, especially if Jane tried to conceal her actions or if the injuries were subtle. This is reasonably likely.\n\n2.  **The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben:** The text states, \"no other typical injuries of a death due to smothering were found, such as petechiae.\" Petechiae are considered a \"typical\" sign of smothering. If Jane is guilty of smothering, and a typical sign of smothering is *absent*, this makes the specific pattern of evidence less likely. While smothering doesn't *always* produce petechiae, their absence means this was an atypical smothering, which reduces the probability of observing this particular fact given her guilt.\n\n3.  **The dislocated ribs found in Ben:** The text states, \"the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts.\" If Jane is guilty, Ben still died, and resuscitation attempts would have followed. Therefore, the dislocated ribs being attributed to post-mortem changes or resuscitation is consistent with her guilt. This is reasonably likely.\n\n4.  **The injuries found in Andy:** The text states, \"Andy’s injuries had initially been put down as due to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\" Similar to Ben's ribs, if Jane smothered Andy, resuscitation attempts would have occurred. Thus, Andy's injuries being caused by resuscitation is perfectly consistent with Jane's guilt. This is reasonably likely.\n\nCombining these points: The consistency of the unnoted injuries, the dislocated ribs, and Andy's injuries with resuscitation attempts (which would follow a death by smothering) suggests these elements are quite likely. However, the *absence* of petechiae, a \"typical\" sign of smothering, significantly lowers the overall probability of this specific set of observations occurring if Jane is indeed guilty of smothering. It's not impossible for smothering to occur without petechiae, but it makes this particular manifestation less probable.\n\nConsidering the blend of consistent and less consistent evidence, with the absence of typical smothering signs being the main detractor, the probability is in the lower-to-mid range.\n\n25",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it means the deaths were due to natural causes (like SIDS) or accidents unrelated to her actions (like resuscitation attempts). Let's evaluate each piece of evidence under this assumption:\n\n1.  **Similarities between both incidents:** While two SIDS deaths in one family are rare, the similarities in age, time of day, and Jane being alone could theoretically be a series of extreme coincidences if the deaths were natural. However, the combination of all these specific similarities in two separate, rare events makes a purely coincidental explanation less probable.\n\n2.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain was caused a matter of hours before death:** SIDS is defined as \"sudden and unexplainable.\" Hypoxic damage occurring \"a matter of hours before death\" suggests a prolonged process of oxygen deprivation rather than a sudden, instantaneous death. While some degree of hypoxia precedes any death, this specific duration makes it less consistent with a typical SIDS event.\n\n3.  **The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids:** The text explicitly states these \"are consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these injuries would need to be explained by natural causes or resuscitation. While some hypoxic damage can occur in any death, haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are strong indicators of asphyxia or violent trauma, making them highly unlikely to be present in a natural death scenario if Jane is innocent.\n\n4.  **The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy:** The text states these \"are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\" If Jane is NOT GUILTY, these injuries would have to be explained by natural causes or resuscitation attempts. However, a torn frenulum, blood in the lung, and bruises described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" are not typically found in natural infant deaths and go beyond what is usually expected from resuscitation attempts, even vigorous ones. This finding strongly contradicts the hypothesis of innocence.\n\nConsidering all points, several pieces of evidence are explicitly presented as indicators of abuse or consistent with smothering/violent trauma. If Jane is truly NOT GUILTY, it would be highly improbable for these specific findings, particularly those \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering,\" to be present.\n\n5",
