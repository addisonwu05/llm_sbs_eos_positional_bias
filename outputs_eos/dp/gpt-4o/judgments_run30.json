  "Given the context and information provided, assessing the likelihood involves considering several factors:\n\n1. **Injuries not noted by nurses for Ben:** If the injuries were not observed upon arrival at the hospital, it might suggest they occurred post-mortem or were induced inadvertently during medical interventions like resuscitation.\n\n2. **Spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben:** Given that spinal bleeding is common in natural death and dislocated ribs might be a consequence of resuscitation attempts, these findings are not definitive indicators of foul play.\n\n3. **Absence of petechiae in Ben:** The lack of petechiae, which are commonly seen in smothering cases, weakens the argument for smothering as the cause of death.\n\n4. **Injuries in Andy consistent with resuscitation:** If the injuries observed in Andy are also consistent with resuscitation attempts, they do not strongly point to intentional harm.\n\nConsidering these points, if Jane is indeed not guilty, there is a plausible explanation for the injuries observed in both children that aligns with natural causes and medical intervention rather than intentional harm.\n\nProbability that the scenario aligns with Jane being not guilty: **85**",
