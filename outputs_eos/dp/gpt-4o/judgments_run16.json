  "The likelihood of the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs being due to resuscitation or occurring post-mortem, and the injuries in Andy being linked to resuscitation rather than smothering, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, takes into account several considerations. The explanation that these injuries could result from resuscitation efforts or occur naturally aligns with some possible non-homicidal scenarios, although the situation still presents complex factors which involve interpretation by medical experts. \n\nConsidering these factors, if Jane is not guilty of smothering her children, a probability judgment is made regarding the interpretation of these findings in the light of innocence.\n\n60",
