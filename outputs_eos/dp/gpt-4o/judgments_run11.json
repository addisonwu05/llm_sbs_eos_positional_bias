  "Given the details provided, the injuries such as spinal bleeding, dislocated ribs, and those noted on Andy could reasonably be attributed to resuscitation efforts or natural causes if Jane is not guilty. Absence of injuries typical of smothering, like petechiae, supports the possibility that these were not caused by intentional harm. Additionally, the lack of noted injuries by nurses upon Ben's arrival at the hospital could imply they occurred during or after resuscitation attempts. Given this context, if Jane is not guilty, it is reasonably likely that these circumstances align with explanations other than deliberate harm. \n\n70",
