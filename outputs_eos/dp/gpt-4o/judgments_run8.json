  "Given the context of the case and the information provided, it is possible to consider that the injuries found on Ben were not present when initially brought to the hospital due to the absence of documentation by nurses, and that some of the injuries could be attributed to natural causes or resuscitation attempts. There is also the possibility that the absence of other typical smothering signs, such as petechiae, may suggest an alternative explanation for the death. Given these considerations and the potential for other explanations like SIDS, the likelihood that the injuries were not present initially or had alternative causes (assuming Jane is not guilty) can be reasonably speculated upon. \n\nThe probability judgment is: **65**",
