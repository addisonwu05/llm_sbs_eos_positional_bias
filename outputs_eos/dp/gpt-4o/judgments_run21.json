  "Given the context provided, if Jane is not guilty, it is possible to consider that the injuries found on Ben may have explanations other than deliberate harm, such as injuries from resuscitation attempts and post-mortem changes. Considering these factors, including the absence of petechiae and the context that similar injuries in Andy were initially ascribed to resuscitation, a probability judgment could be made. \n\nThe likelihood that these injuries can be explained without asserting guilt, considering the given factors, is subject to a degree of uncertainty, but a reasonable probability judgment, given the hypothesis that Jane is not guilty, would be around **70**.",
