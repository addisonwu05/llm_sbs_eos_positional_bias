  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence provided suggests that the medical findings may have been misinterpreted or overlooked, and that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) could be a plausible explanation for the deaths of both children.\n\n90",

  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy. The evidence strongly suggests that these findings are indicative of smothering and abuse, which would be highly improbable in the case of natural causes or SIDS.\n\n20",
