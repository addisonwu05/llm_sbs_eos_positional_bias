  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence suggests that these findings may have been due to natural causes or the resuscitation attempts, rather than intentional harm.\n\nThe absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, and the presence of injuries consistent with resuscitation efforts, suggest that the deaths of the children may have been due to natural causes, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a leading cause of death in infants, and it is more common among boys, which aligns with the case details.\n\nAdditionally, the injuries found on Ben, such as the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, are not necessarily indicative of murder, as they can also be found in natural deaths or as a result of resuscitation attempts.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented suggests that the deaths of the children may have been due to natural causes, and the injuries found could be explained by factors other than intentional harm. Therefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that the evidence supports her innocence is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, it is highly unlikely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy.\n\nThe evidence presented suggests that Jane intentionally smothered both of her children, and the lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, does not necessarily indicate that the children were not smothered. It is possible that the lack of these injuries could be due to the specific circumstances of the case or the way in which the smothering was carried out.\n\nAdditionally, the dislocated ribs found in Ben could be a result of the smothering, and the injuries found in Andy, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, are consistent with the suspected method of smothering.\n\nOverall, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the evidence supports her innocence is:\n\n10%",
  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.\n\nThe similarities in the timing and circumstances of the two deaths, as well as the specific injuries found on the children, strongly suggest a pattern of intentional harm rather than natural causes. The hypoxic damage and haemorrhages in Ben, as well as the injuries found in the re-examination of Andy's death, are all consistent with smothering or other forms of abusive trauma.\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of all these factors aligning in this way is extremely low, as it would be highly improbable for such a pattern of suspicious circumstances and injuries to occur by chance in two separate incidents.\n\nTherefore, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of the evidence supporting this is:\n\n10%",
