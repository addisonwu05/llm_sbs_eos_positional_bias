  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence suggests that the injuries could have been caused by the resuscitation attempts or were consistent with natural causes of death, such as SIDS. The lack of typical smothering injuries further supports the possibility of natural causes. Given the information provided, the probability that Jane is not guilty is 90%.\n\n90",

The evidence suggests that the injuries were consistent with smothering, which is the alleged cause of death. The lack of typical smothering injuries like petechiae is not sufficient to discount the possibility of guilt, as the absence of such injuries does not rule out smothering.

  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy. The evidence presented strongly suggests a pattern of abuse and smothering, which is unlikely to occur by chance or natural causes.
