  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. The evidence suggests that the deaths of Andy and Ben could be attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rather than smothering.\n\nThe key points that support this are:\n- The injuries on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, suggesting they may have developed later.\n- The lack of typical smothering injuries like petechiae on Ben casts doubt on the smothering hypothesis.\n- The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are common findings in natural deaths and could be due to resuscitation attempts.\n- The injuries found on Andy were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts, and are consistent with attempts to revive a baby.\n- SIDS is a recognized cause of sudden and unexplained infant deaths, with a frequency of 1 in 4,000 in the UK.\n\nGiven the evidence, if Jane is not guilty, the probability that the injuries were not present as claimed is:\n\n90%",

  "If Jane is not guilty, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy.\n\nThe key points that support this are:\n- The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies, the time of day, and Jane being alone with them, could be coincidental if the deaths were due to natural causes like SIDS.\n- The doctor's claim that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused hours before death is questionable, as SIDS can cause sudden and unexplained infant deaths.\n- The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, as well as the injuries found on Andy, are more indicative of smothering or other violent trauma, which would be inconsistent with Jane's innocence.\n\nGiven the evidence, if Jane is not guilty, the probability of these similarities, the timing of the hypoxic damage, and the nature of the injuries is:\n\n20%",
