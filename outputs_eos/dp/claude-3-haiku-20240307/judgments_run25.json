  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly likely that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy. This is because:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not noted by the nurses when he was brought to the hospital, suggesting they may have occurred later or were not present at the time.\n\n2. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, casts doubt on the assertion that the deaths were due to smothering.\n\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are common findings in natural deaths and could have occurred during resuscitation attempts.\n\n4. The injuries found in Andy's case were initially attributed to the resuscitation attempts, and such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a baby.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that the evidence points to natural causes or accidental injuries, rather than intentional smothering, is very high.\n\n90%",

This is because:\n\n1. If Jane is guilty of intentionally smothering her children, it is less likely that the injuries on Ben would not have been present when he was brought to the hospital.\n\n2. The absence of typical injuries associated with smothering, such as petechiae, would be less plausible if Jane is guilty, as smothering is the alleged cause of death.\n\n3. The dislocated ribs found in Ben's autopsy are more likely to be the result of intentional harm rather than resuscitation attempts if Jane is guilty.\n\n4. The injuries found in Andy's case, initially attributed to resuscitation, may have been more indicative of intentional harm if Jane is guilty.\n\nGiven these factors, if Jane is GUILTY, the probability that the evidence points to natural causes or accidental injuries, rather than intentional smothering, is low.\n\n20%",
  "If Jane is NOT GUILTY, it is highly unlikely that there would be these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy. This is because:\n\n1. The similarities between the two incidents, such as the age of the babies and the circumstances of their deaths, would be highly unlikely to occur by chance if Jane is not guilty of intentionally causing their deaths.\n\n2. The specific medical evidence, such as the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and the injuries found on Andy, are strongly indicative of intentional harm rather than natural causes.\n\n3. The doctor's assertion that the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain must have been caused a matter of hours before death is concerning and suggests a non-natural cause.\n\n4. The injuries found on Andy, such as the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, are characteristic of smothering and abuse, making it unlikely that they occurred by chance if Jane is not guilty.\n\nGiven the weight of the evidence, if Jane is NOT GUILTY, the probability that these similarities and medical findings would occur is very low.\n\n10%",
