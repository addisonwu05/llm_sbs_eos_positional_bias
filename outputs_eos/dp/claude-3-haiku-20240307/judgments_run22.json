  "Given the information provided, the likelihood that Jane is not guilty is quite high. The key factors that suggest this are:\n\n1. The initial autopsy of Andy found natural causes of death, and the injuries found were likely due to resuscitation attempts.\n2. The injuries found on Ben, including the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, are common findings in natural infant deaths and can occur during resuscitation efforts.\n3. The lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, on Ben's body.\n4. The fact that the nurses did not note any injuries when Ben was brought to the hospital, suggesting the injuries may have occurred later.\n5. The high frequency of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a leading cause of infant mortality with no clear mechanism or cause.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that Jane is not guilty is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the following factors is relatively low:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital: This is unlikely, as the autopsy clearly found injuries that would have been present at the time of arrival.\n2. The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben: The lack of typical smothering injuries is concerning, as they are often present in cases of intentional suffocation.\n3. The dislocated ribs found in Ben: These injuries are more consistent with resuscitation attempts than natural causes.\n4. The injuries found in Andy: The initial assessment of natural causes may have been incorrect, and the subsequent findings of bruises and other injuries raise suspicion.\n\nConsidering all these factors, if Jane is guilty, the probability is:\n\n20%",
  "Given the additional information provided, the likelihood that Jane is not guilty is significantly lower. The key factors that suggest she may be guilty are:\n\n1. The similarities between the two incidents, including the age of the babies, the time of day, and the circumstances of being found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.\n2. The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain that was likely caused just hours before his death, which is consistent with smothering.\n3. The hemorrhages to Ben's eyes and eyelids, which are also characteristic of smothering.\n4. The bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found on Andy's body, which indicate abuse and are consistent with smothering.\n\nConsidering all these factors, if Jane is not guilty, the probability is:\n\n10%",
