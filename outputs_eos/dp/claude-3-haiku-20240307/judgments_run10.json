  "Based on the information provided, if Jane is not guilty, the likelihood that:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is high, as the nurses did not note any injuries at that time.\n\n2. The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is consistent with a natural cause of death, as petechiae are not always present in cases of smothering.\n\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben are common findings in natural deaths and could be attributed to resuscitation attempts.\n\n4. The injuries found in Andy were likely due to the resuscitation attempts, as such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the evidence supports Jane's innocence in the deaths of her two children is:\n\n90%",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that:\n\n1. The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital is low, as the nurses did not note any injuries at that time. This suggests the injuries were likely inflicted later, potentially by Jane.\n\n2. The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben is not consistent with smothering, as petechiae are a common finding in such cases. This weakens the case for Jane's guilt.\n\n3. The dislocated ribs found in Ben are more consistent with resuscitation attempts than intentional harm, and this evidence does not strongly support Jane's guilt.\n\n4. The injuries found in Andy were likely due to the resuscitation attempts, as such injuries are consistent with attempts to revive a person, especially a baby. This evidence does not support Jane's guilt.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the evidence supports Jane's guilt in the deaths of her two children is:\n\n30%",

The similarities between both incidents (age, time of day, found unconscious by Jane alone) could potentially be coincidental, but are still quite unlikely. 20%\n\n2.
