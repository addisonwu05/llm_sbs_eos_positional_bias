  "Given the information provided, the likelihood that Jane is not guilty is quite high. The evidence seems to suggest that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and the lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, as well as the common findings of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, point to a natural cause of death rather than homicide.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the initial injuries found on Andy were attributed to the resuscitation attempts, and the high incidence of SIDS, particularly among boys, further supports the possibility of natural causes.\n\nConsidering all the factors, the probability that Jane is not guilty is 80%.\n\n80",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the following is relatively low:\n- The injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital\n- The absence of injuries such as petechiae in Ben\n- The dislocated ribs found in Ben\n- The injuries found in Andy\n\nThe lack of typical smothering injuries, such as petechiae, and the presence of injuries that can be attributed to natural causes or resuscitation attempts, suggest that the evidence does not strongly support Jane's guilt.\n\nGiven the information provided, the probability that Jane is guilty is 30%.\n\n30",
  "Given the additional information provided:\n\n- The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain was caused a matter of hours before his death\n- The similarities between the two incidents, including the babies' ages and circumstances of death\n- The injuries found on Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lung) being indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\n- The hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma\n\nIf Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of all these factors occurring together is relatively low. The similarities between the two incidents, the timing of the hypoxic damage in Ben, and the specific injuries found in both cases point more strongly towards Jane being responsible.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, the probability that Jane is not guilty is 20%.\n\n20",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood of the following is very high:\n\n- The similarities between both incidents, including the babies' ages and circumstances of death\n- The hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before his death\n- The hypoxic damage and hemorrhages in Ben being consistent with smothering or other violent trauma\n- The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung found in Andy, which are indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\n\nGiven the substantial evidence pointing towards Jane's guilt, including the specific injuries found in both cases and the timing of the hypoxic damage in Ben, the probability that Jane is guilty is very high.\n\n90",
