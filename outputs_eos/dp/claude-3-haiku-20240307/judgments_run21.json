  "Based on the information provided, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben, the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts, suggests that Jane is likely not guilty of the murders of her two children. The evidence presented indicates that there are plausible alternative explanations for the deaths, such as SIDS, which could account for the findings without necessarily implicating Jane in intentional homicide.\n\n70",
  "If Jane is guilty, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, the absence of typical smothering injuries like petechiae in Ben, the dislocated ribs found in Ben, and the injuries found in Andy being consistent with resuscitation attempts is relatively low. In a case of intentional smothering, one would expect the injuries to be present upon arrival at the hospital, and the lack of typical smothering indicators would be unusual. The dislocated ribs and other findings could potentially be explained by the resuscitation attempts, but the overall evidence would be more consistent with Jane being guilty of the murders.\n\n30",
  "If Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of there being these similarities between both incidents, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain being caused a matter of hours before death, the hypoxic damage to Ben's brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids, and the bruises, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung in Andy is relatively low. The consistency of the evidence, including the medical findings, the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths, and the potential indicators of abuse in both cases, would make it less plausible that these are just coincidental occurrences if Jane is not the perpetrator.\n\n30",

The consistent evidence, including the medical findings and the similar circumstances surrounding the deaths, would strongly suggest a pattern of intentional actions by Jane if she is the perpetrator.\n\n90",
  "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, including the similarities between the two incidents, the medical findings consistent with smothering and abuse, and the lack of strong alternative explanations, the probability that the defendant, Jane, is guilty of the murders of her two children is:\n\n70",
  "Based on the information provided, my verdict for the defendant, Jane, is:\n\nGuilty"
