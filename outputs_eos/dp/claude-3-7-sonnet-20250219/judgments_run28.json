  "To assess this probability, I need to carefully consider the facts of the case and the alternative explanations.\n\nIf Jane is NOT GUILTY, we would need to explain:\n1. The injuries found on Ben that weren't noted by nurses initially\n2. The absence of petechiae (typically found in smothering cases) in Ben\n3. The spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs in Ben\n4. The injuries found in Andy\n\nThe case mentions that:\n- Spinal bleeding can be a common finding in natural death\n- Dislocated ribs could have occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation\n- Andy's injuries were initially attributed to resuscitation attempts\n- SIDS is a possible alternative explanation (1 in 4,000 occurrence rate)\n\nIf Jane is innocent, the injuries would need to be explained by either:\n- Natural causes like SIDS\n- Injuries that occurred during resuscitation attempts\n- Post-mortem changes\n- Medical examination errors\n\nThe fact that nurses didn't note Ben's injuries initially suggests they might not have been obvious or may have developed post-admission. The absence of petechiae weighs against smothering as a cause. The explanations for the spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs as being consistent with natural death or resuscitation seem plausible.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that these findings would occur if Jane is NOT GUILTY is: 65",
  "To assess the probability if Jane is GUILTY of murder by smothering:\n\n1. Regarding injuries not being noted on Ben when brought to hospital:\n- If Jane is guilty, this could be because the injuries were subtle initially and became more apparent later, or there was an oversight by medical staff in the emergency situation.\n\n2. The absence of petechiae (tiny spots) in Ben:\n- This is more problematic for a guilty verdict since petechiae are often present in smothering cases. However, not all smothering cases present with petechiae, especially if the smothering was brief or partial.\n\n3. The dislocated ribs in Ben:\n- If Jane is guilty, the explanation that these occurred during resuscitation attempts or post-mortem becomes less likely, as they could instead represent trauma from an assault.\n\n4. Injuries found in Andy:\n- If Jane is guilty, the presence of bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung are more consistent with deliberate harm than with resuscitation attempts.\n\n5. Pattern of two deaths:\n- If Jane is guilty, the repeated pattern becomes significant - two infant deaths with similar circumstances is statistically unlikely through natural causes alone.\n\nWeighing these factors, if Jane is guilty, there would need to be explanations for the absence of petechiae and why certain injuries weren't initially noted. These inconsistencies reduce the probability somewhat.\n\n45",
  "I need to evaluate how likely these combined findings would be if Jane is NOT guilty.\n\nThe new evidence presents concerning patterns:\n\n1. Timing similarities: Both babies died at similar ages, similar times of day after feeding, and both were found by Jane when she was alone with them.\n\n2. Ben's injuries: Hypoxic brain damage occurring hours before death, plus hemorrhages to eyes and eyelids that are consistent with smothering.\n\n3. Andy's injuries: Bruises to arms and legs, torn frenulum, and blood in the lung - now identified as indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering.\n\nIf Jane is NOT guilty, these findings would need alternative explanations:\n\n- The timing similarities could potentially be explained by some underlying genetic or medical vulnerability that manifests at a particular developmental stage or after feeding.\n\n- However, the specific injuries (especially the torn frenulum in Andy and the eye hemorrhages in Ben) are highly specific to trauma and difficult to explain through natural causes.\n\n- Two separate instances of SIDS (already rare at 1 in 4,000) with these specific trauma indicators would be extraordinarily improbable.\n\n- The presence of multiple trauma indicators across both cases that medical experts identify as consistent with smothering makes innocent explanations extremely unlikely.\n\nGiven the specificity of the injuries, their documented connection to smothering, and the striking pattern across two separate deaths, the probability of all these findings occurring if Jane is NOT guilty is: 15",
  "If Jane is GUILTY of murdering both children by smothering, I need to assess how likely these findings would be:\n\n1. Similarities between incidents: If guilty, the similar pattern (both babies at similar ages, dying at similar times of day after feeding, when alone with Jane) would be expected as it would reflect Jane's established pattern of behavior or opportunity.\n\n2. Hypoxic damage to Ben's brain hours before death: If guilty of smothering, this timing would be consistent with Jane's actions causing oxygen deprivation.\n\n3. Hypoxic brain damage and eye/eyelid hemorrhages in Ben: These are recognized medical consequences of smothering, so would be expected if Jane is guilty.\n\n4. Injuries to Andy (bruises, torn frenulum, lung blood): These are described as \"indicative of abuse and characteristic of smothering\" by medical experts, which aligns with guilt.\n\nThe medical findings are consistent with the mechanism of death alleged (smothering). The pattern of injuries across both children shows consistency with the same method of harm.\n\nHowever, I must note that even if Jane is guilty, there's not absolute certainty that all these specific injuries would present exactly as they did, as smothering can sometimes present with varying injury patterns.\n\n85",
  "To determine the probability of guilt, I'll analyze the evidence presented and weigh the comparative likelihoods.\n\nKey evidence supporting guilt:\n- Two children died under similar circumstances (similar ages, times of day, after feeding, alone with Jane)\n- Medical evidence indicating trauma consistent with smothering in both children\n- Specific injuries (torn frenulum in Andy, eye hemorrhages in Ben) that experts identify as characteristic of abuse/smothering\n- Hypoxic brain damage to Ben occurring hours before death\n- The rarity of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family with these specific injury patterns\n\nKey evidence supporting innocence:\n- Initial determination of natural causes for Andy's death\n- Some injuries could potentially be explained by resuscitation attempts\n- Absence of petechiae in Ben (which can be present in smothering cases)\n- Nurses not initially noting injuries on Ben\n\nThe pattern of similar deaths with specific injuries consistent with smothering is highly incriminating. The medical evidence - particularly the constellation of injuries across both children that experts identify as characteristic of abuse - strongly suggests non-accidental trauma rather than natural causes or resuscitation injuries.\n\nWhen comparing the likelihood of these findings under guilt (85%) versus innocence (15%), and considering the totality of evidence, I assess the probability of guilt at:\n\n78",
