Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

Hospital documentation errors or oversight are not uncommon in emergency situations.\n\nRegarding Andy's injuries being consistent with resuscitation attempts: This is specifically mentioned as a plausible explanation, making these findings compatible with Jane's innocence.\n\nFor Ben's spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs: The information states these could be explained by natural death or resuscitation attempts, which supports a non-homicide scenario.\n\nThe absence of petechiae in Ben is significant, as these are typically present in smothering cases. Their absence makes the smothering explanation less likely.\n\nThe coincidence of two SIDS deaths in one family is rare but not impossible. While SIDS occurs in 1 in 4,000 infants, having it occur twice in one family is much rarer but has been documented.\n\nConsidering all these factors together - the alternative explanations for the injuries, the missing typical signs of smothering, and the possibility (though rare) of two SIDS cases - I would estimate the probability at:\n\n75"

This could be reasonably expected if she is guilty.\n\nThe absence of petechiae (tiny red spots) in Ben is more problematic for the guilt hypothesis. Petechiae are considered typical findings in smothering cases, so their absence makes the smothering explanation somewhat less likely.\n\nThe dislocated ribs and spinal bleeding in Ben being attributed to resuscitation or post-mortem changes would be a coincidence that could mask homicide if Jane is guilty.\n\nFor Andy, the injuries discovered retrospectively (bruises, torn frenulum, blood in lungs) are potentially consistent with smothering, though they were initially missed or attributed to resuscitation.\n\nIf Jane is guilty, these findings represent a scenario where some expected evidence of smothering is present, while other typical evidence (petechiae) is absent, and some findings have plausible alternative explanations.\n\nBased on this analysis, I estimate the probability at:\n\n45"
