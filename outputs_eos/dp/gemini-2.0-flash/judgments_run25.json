  "Let's analyze the likelihood of the given facts if Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, meaning their deaths were due to natural causes (potentially SIDS) or accidental injuries.\n\n*   **Injuries on Ben not noted at the hospital:** If Ben's death was sudden and unexpected, resuscitation attempts would be made. Resuscitation can cause injuries. The injuries could have developed during or after resuscitation efforts in the ambulance or at the hospital, and hence were not noticed on arrival. This scenario is plausible if death was not directly from external injuries. Therefore, given the hypothetical not guilty situation, let's say this is reasonably probable.\n\n*   **Absence of Petechiae in Ben:** Petechiae are not always present in cases of smothering. Their absence is also consistent with other causes of death. Additionally, SIDS does not present with Petechiae. Therefore, this is highly probable.\n\n*   **Spinal Bleeding and Dislocated Ribs in Ben:** The provided information states the spinal bleeding can occur in natural death and that the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts. This aligns with the hypothesis of innocence and an attempt to save Ben's life. This is highly probable.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy attributed to Resuscitation:** The injuries on Andy are considered consistent with resuscitation efforts. This aligns with a scenario where the baby died of natural causes/SIDS, and paramedics caused the injuries while attempting to save him. Thus, this is highly probable.\n\nConsidering the probability of all the above events happening at the same time, if Jane is not guilty, we need to make an overall probability assessment. The evidence either points toward or are consistent with the alternative hypothesis (Jane is not guilty of the crime). The absence of classic smothering signs (petechiae) along with the injuries explainable by resuscitation makes this probability relatively high.\n\n85\n",
  "If Jane is guilty of smothering her children, we need to assess the likelihood of the specified factors. This scenario posits that Jane intentionally killed her children.\n\n*   **Injuries on Ben not noted at the hospital:** If Jane intentionally smothered Ben, she might have done so in a way that didn't immediately cause obvious external injuries apparent to someone quickly assessing the baby at arrival. The smothering could cause internal damage or oxygen deprivation without leaving marks. So, it is still quite possible that the injuries were not present.\n\n*   **Absence of Petechiae in Ben:** While petechiae are often associated with smothering, they are not always present. The absence doesn't definitively rule out smothering. It might depend on the method of smothering and the baby's specific physiological response. The probability is still reasonably high that they are absent, because their presence is not necessary to prove smothering.\n\n*   **Spinal Bleeding and Dislocated Ribs in Ben:** In this scenario, the spinal bleeding being a common finding in natural death, and the dislocated ribs probably occurred post-mortem or due to resuscitation attempts would benefit the defense. However, they are still possible to find. Therefore, this is not highly likely to be the case, but moderately likely.\n\n*   **Injuries on Andy attributed to Resuscitation:** If Jane smothered Andy, the injuries being attributed to resuscitation efforts is a helpful coincidence for Jane. Therefore, it is moderately likely.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of these factors occurring simultaneously when Jane *is* guilty is less than if she were innocent, but it's not so unlikely as to dismiss the possibility.\n\n40\n",
  "Let's analyze the likelihood of the given evidence if Jane is not guilty of murdering her children, implying their deaths were due to natural causes (potentially SIDS), accidental injuries, or some other unexplained event.\n\n*   **Similarities between Incidents:** If both babies had a genetic predisposition to SIDS or a rare underlying condition, the similarities in age, time of day, and circumstances of discovery become less surprising. While it's still a notable coincidence, it doesn't necessarily point to foul play. Given that the similarities are present, in the scenario where Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of this occurring might be moderate.\n\n*   **Hypoxic Damage to Ben Hours Before Death:** Even in a natural death scenario (like SIDS), the final stages of life can involve a lack of oxygen. The hypoxic damage occurring hours before death, even with a natural cause, is highly plausible.\n\n*   **Hypoxic Damage, Haemorrhages consistent with Smothering:** While these injuries are consistent with smothering, they can also be caused by other violent trauma, some medical conditions, or even potentially by severe resuscitation attempts (though less likely to cause the hemorrhages). The fact that there is a more innocent explanation here is important. In the event that Jane is not guilty, the likelihood of these types of injuries being present is moderate.\n\n*   **Bruises, Torn Frenulum, Blood in Lung in Andy:** If Jane is not guilty, we can assume that the initial injuries to Andy were a result of resuscitation attempts by paramedics, and were mis-interpreted. Given this, the probability of these injuries being present and potentially mis-attributed is moderate.\n\nConsidering all these factors occurring simultaneously, and assuming Jane is not guilty, it requires a degree of coincidence and atypical presentation of SIDS. The presence of injuries, although there is an alternative explanation to them, do make the probability somewhat lower.\n\n30\n",
  "Let's assess the likelihood of the presented evidence if Jane is guilty of murdering her children.\n\n*   **Similarities between Incidents:** If Jane intentionally killed both children, the similarities are highly likely. A perpetrator might use a similar method or be triggered by similar circumstances in both instances. This makes the similarities a strong indicator of guilt. Thus, the probability is very high.\n\n*   **Hypoxic Damage to Ben Hours Before Death:** This aligns directly with a smothering scenario. Smothering would cause oxygen deprivation leading to brain damage shortly before death. Therefore this is highly probable.\n\n*   **Hypoxic Damage, Haemorrhages consistent with Smothering:** This evidence directly supports the prosecution's case, strengthening the likelihood of guilt. Smothering causes hypoxia and can result in these hemorrhages. Therefore, the likelihood of these findings occurring is high.\n\n*   **Bruises, Torn Frenulum, Blood in Lung in Andy:** These injuries are now interpreted as abuse/smothering-related. If Jane is guilty, their presence strongly supports the prosecution's case. Therefore, these injuries are highly likely.\n\nConsidering all these factors in conjunction, if Jane is guilty, the likelihood of this evidence being present is very high. The similarities and the specific injury patterns paint a compelling picture of intentional harm.\n\n90\n",
  "Based on the evidence, there are several factors pointing towards guilt: the similarities between the two deaths, the hypoxic brain damage occurring shortly before death in Ben, injuries such as hemorrhages consistent with smothering, and the re-evaluated injuries on Andy initially attributed to resuscitation now considered signs of abuse. While SIDS is possible, the presence of injuries and the striking similarities make it less probable. However, the lack of definitive evidence such as consistent injuries prevents this being certain.\n\n70\n",
  "Based solely on the provided information and adhering to the principle of requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I cannot definitively state a verdict. However, given the probability assessment of 70, the evidence leans towards *Guilty*, but the highness of this probability does not equate to a definite verdict. Therefore, based on the information, the higher likelihood would point toward the verdict:\n\nGuilty\n"
