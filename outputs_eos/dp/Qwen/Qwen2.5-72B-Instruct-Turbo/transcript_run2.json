    "content": "Jane is charged with two counts of murder of both her children, and here is the background of\nthe case:\nAfter Jane and Frank had been happily married for 5 years, their first son, Andy, was born.\nWhen Andy was 11 weeks old, Jane found the baby had fallen unconscious after being put to\nbed when she was alone with the baby at home. Jane soon called an ambulance, but Andy\nwas declared dead after being transported to the hospital. A post-mortem was conducted and\nit suggested natural causes of death.\nAfter one year, Jane and Frank’s second son, Ben, was born. When Ben was 8 weeks old,\nJane discovered that the baby was unwell, and the couple called an ambulance. However, Ben\ncould not be resuscitated either and was pronounced dead. An autopsy was conducted and\ninjuries to the ribs and spinal cord, hypoxic damage (low level of oxygen) to the brain, and\nhaemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids were discovered.\nAs a result of this finding, further tests based on Andy’s (the first son) autopsy photographs\nwere carried out, and found bruises to the arms and legs, a torn frenulum, and blood in the\nlung. Subsequently, Jane was charged with two counts of murder of both children by\nsmothering them.\nAnother possible explanation for the death of Andy and Ben is sudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS), also known as COT or CRIB death. This is a sudden and unexplainable death of\ninfants during their first year of life. There are a number of risk factors that correlate with\nSIDS, but no clear mechanism or cause has been identified. The frequency of SIDS is 1 in\n4,000 in the UK, and it is more common among boys than girls."

    "content": "Considering the details provided, if Jane is not guilty, it is plausible that the injuries found on Ben could have been overlooked or occurred post-mortem or during resuscitation. The absence of petechiae, which are typically found in smothering, and the natural occurrence of spinal bleeding and dislocated ribs, support the possibility that the deaths were not due to smothering. Additionally, the initial misinterpretation of Andy's injuries as resuscitation-related adds to the complexity of the case. However, the presence of other significant injuries in both children, such as bruises and a torn frenulum, cannot be entirely dismissed. Taking all these factors into account, the likelihood that the injuries found on Ben were not present when he was brought to the hospital, and the absence of typical smothering injuries, is moderate.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"
