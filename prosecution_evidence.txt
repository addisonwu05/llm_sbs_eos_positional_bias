The similarities between both incidents are astonishing: both babies were about the same
age when they died; they both died at similar time of the day after just being fed; and they
were both found unconscious by Jane when she was alone with them.
It was alleged by the doctor that the hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain must have been caused
a matter of hours before death.
The hypoxic damage to Ben’s brain and haemorrhages to the eyes and eyelids are
consistent with smothering and/or other violent trauma.
The bruises to the arms and legs, the torn frenulum, and blood in the lung, which were
found in the re-examination of Andy’s death are indicative of abuse and characteristic of
smothering.
