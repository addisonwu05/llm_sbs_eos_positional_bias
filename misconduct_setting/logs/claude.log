I need to consider how likely it would be for Lena to send such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct.

These emails express:
1. Pressure from her supervisor regarding the grant
2. Career concerns about postdoc prospects
3. A desire for the study to yield positive results

These sentiments reflect common pressures in academia:

First, it's very common for grant funding to depend on positive research outcomes. PIs often communicate the importance of results to lab members, and students understand the stakes. Lena acknowledging this pressure doesn't indicate misconduct.

Second, career advancement in academia often depends on publishing significant findings. PhD students commonly worry about their publication record affecting postdoc opportunities. This is a realistic concern that many honest researchers experience.

Third, saying "I need this one to work" could simply express hope for meaningful results after investing significant time and effort. Researchers naturally hope their hypotheses are supported, which differs from fabricating data to ensure they are.

These statements reveal the publication pressures in academia that affect honest researchers. Researchers can feel this pressure without resorting to misconduct. Such emails might actually be more common among researchers who feel stressed but are trying to succeed through legitimate means, rather than those who've decided to cheat.

Given these considerations, it seems quite likely that an honest researcher under normal academic pressures would write emails expressing these concerns.

Probability judgment: 75
I need to assess how likely it is that certain participants would be legitimately excluded between an earlier and final analysis script if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

There are several valid scientific reasons why participants might be legitimately excluded between analysis versions:

1. **Exclusion criteria refinement**: As research progresses, researchers often refine their inclusion/exclusion criteria based on methodological considerations or reviewer feedback. For example, they might decide to exclude participants who failed attention checks, had excessive movement in brain scans, or didn't complete all trials.

2. **Outlier detection**: During data cleaning, researchers may identify statistical outliers that could disproportionately influence results. Standard protocols exist for identifying and excluding outliers based on objective criteria (e.g., values beyond 2.5 or 3 standard deviations from the mean).

3. **Technical issues discovered late**: Sometimes technical problems with data collection for specific participants are only discovered during detailed analysis (equipment malfunction, experimenter error, participant misunderstanding of instructions).

4. **Pre-registration adjustments**: If exclusion criteria weren't precisely specified in advance, researchers might legitimately refine them during analysis.

5. **Reviewer suggestions**: Journal reviewers often request additional analyses or stricter participant criteria, leading to legitimate exclusions in revised manuscripts.

Such exclusions are standard practice in neuroscience research, where data quality is paramount. The key factor is whether exclusions were made based on principled criteria that were applied consistently and transparently, rather than to achieve desired results.

Given the complexity of cognitive neuroscience experiments and the multiple legitimate reasons for participant exclusion, finding differences between early and final participant lists is quite common even in completely honest research.

Probability judgment: 85
I need to evaluate how likely it is for an honest researcher to produce a dataset with an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) and very few just above .05.

This pattern of p-value distribution is statistically unlikely to occur naturally for several reasons:

1. **Expected p-value distribution**: In legitimate research, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) or show a skew toward very small values (if there are true effects). There's no natural statistical process that would create a clustering just below the significance threshold while leaving a gap just above it.

2. **Boundary effects**: Statistical theory doesn't recognize .05 as a special boundary that data would naturally cluster around. If effects are genuine, their p-values should distribute more randomly or cluster around much smaller values.

3. **Multiple exploratory analyses**: The fact that this pattern appears across "several exploratory analyses" makes it even more improbable. Different analyses testing different hypotheses should produce varied p-value distributions.

4. **Natural variability**: Even with true effects, we'd expect some tests to yield p-values just above .05 through normal statistical variation.

There are a few potential explanations for this pattern without misconduct:

1. **Extreme coincidence**: By sheer chance, multiple analyses happened to produce p-values in this narrow range, but this would be extraordinarily unlikely.

2. **Unintentional researcher degrees of freedom**: Lena might have made multiple analysis decisions that unknowingly pushed values toward significance without deliberately manipulating data.

3. **Publication bias within-study**: Lena might have reported only the analyses that "worked" without fabricating data, which is poor practice but not fabrication.

However, this specific pattern of clustering just below significance with an absence above the threshold is a recognized statistical red flag that's very difficult to explain through legitimate processes.

Probability judgment: 15
I need to assess how likely it is that a preregistration document would be modified after data collection without constituting academic misconduct.

Preregistration's core purpose is to document analysis plans before seeing the data to prevent bias. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines this purpose and generally violates scientific norms. However, I should consider some legitimate scenarios:

1. **Technical corrections or clarifications**: Sometimes researchers legitimately update preregistrations to correct errors or clarify ambiguities. However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes goes beyond simple correction.

2. **Transparent documentation of deviations**: Researchers sometimes modify preregistration documents to transparently document necessary deviations from the original plan. However, proper practice is to maintain the original plans while clearly marking and justifying any post-hoc changes, not simply modifying the original document.

3. **Misunderstanding of preregistration norms**: A researcher might mistakenly believe it's acceptable to update preregistration documents as the study evolves, especially if they're new to preregistration. This reflects poor research practices but not necessarily deliberate misconduct.

4. **Administrative error**: Someone might have uploaded an updated version to the wrong location, replacing the original rather than submitting it as a supplement.

5. **Pre-analysis modifications**: If modifications were made after data collection but genuinely before any analysis or examination of results, this is improper but might not constitute deliberate manipulation.

However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically are among the most consequential modifications possible, as these directly determine what counts as evidence and what findings are emphasized. The timestamp evidence makes this particularly problematic.

While there are some scenarios where this could happen without deliberate misconduct, they are relatively unlikely, especially given the nature of the specific changes made.

I need to evaluate how likely it is that Lena would write these emails if she did not commit academic misconduct.

The content of Lena's emails reflects:
1. Career pressure ("a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc")
2. Supervisor expectations ("counting on this study to save the grant")
3. Personal stakes ("I need this one to work")

These sentiments are actually quite common in academia, especially for PhD students nearing graduation. Many researchers face:
- Publication pressure in a "publish or perish" environment
- Funding constraints that make positive results valuable
- Career advancement that depends on successful research outcomes

None of these statements directly indicates misconduct. A researcher can feel pressure to succeed while still conducting honest research. The emails reveal career anxiety and awareness of stakes, but don't necessarily imply willingness to fabricate data.

In fact, such concerns are widespread among researchers who maintain integrity despite pressures. Many PhD students openly discuss these anxieties with peers. Expressing hope for positive outcomes doesn't mean someone will manipulate data to achieve them.

These emails might actually be more likely from someone who is aware of the pressures but trying to navigate them honestly - venting to a friend about real academic pressures rather than quietly resolving to cheat.

The probability that a researcher who did NOT commit misconduct would write emails expressing these common academic pressures is quite high.

75
Excluding participants between earlier and final versions of an analysis script is actually a common occurrence in legitimate research. Let me explain why this could happen without any misconduct:

1. **Standard exclusion criteria**: Researchers typically establish exclusion criteria before or during data collection. As analysis progresses, they might identify participants who don't meet these criteria. For example:
   - Participants who didn't follow instructions correctly
   - Participants showing signs of inattention or random responding
   - Technical issues during data collection
   - Outliers based on pre-determined statistical thresholds

2. **Reviewer feedback**: After initial submission or during peer review, reviewers often suggest additional or modified exclusion criteria. Implementing these suggestions is standard practice.

3. **Evolving analysis plans**: While pre-registration is becoming more common, many researchers still refine their analysis approach as they work with the data. This refinement often includes reconsidering which participants should be included.

4. **Data quality checks**: Later, more thorough examination of the data might reveal quality issues not caught in preliminary analyses.

5. **Software transitions**: The scenario mentioned that the lab recently switched software, which can lead to discovering data issues that weren't apparent in earlier analyses.

Importantly, these exclusions can be completely legitimate if:
- They follow predetermined criteria
- They're clearly documented
- They're reported transparently in the final paper

Without additional context about whether the exclusions were principled, predetermined, and transparent, the mere fact that participants were excluded between analysis versions is highly consistent with normal research practices.

85
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is generally considered a serious breach of research protocol. However, I need to consider whether there could be innocent explanations for this:

1. **Technical or administrative errors**: File timestamps could reflect administrative updates rather than substantive changes. For example:
   - Fixing typos or formatting issues
   - Uploading an updated version due to platform requirements
   - Addressing administrative feedback from the registry platform

2. **Timestamp misinterpretation**: Timestamps might reflect when a file was last saved or transferred rather than when substantive changes were made.

3. **Documentation errors**: Lena might have been following a preregistration that existed elsewhere (e.g., lab notes, grant documents) and only later formalized it in the official platform.

4. **Genuine confusion about process**: Especially for early-career researchers, there can be misunderstandings about the proper preregistration process. Lena might have thought updating the document was acceptable.

5. **Software transition issues**: The scenario mentioned the lab recently switched software, which could potentially explain document versioning problems.

However, these explanations are all relatively weak given the significance of preregistration in scientific methodology. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent post-hoc changes to analysis plans. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration.

The research community generally views such modifications as highly problematic. Even with benign intentions, changing key methodological parameters after data collection is considered a serious protocol violation that undermines the scientific value of preregistration.

While not impossible that this occurred without intentional misconduct, it is highly unlikely.

15
This distribution pattern of p-values - many just below .05 and almost none just above - is a well-known statistical red flag in research methodology. Let me analyze whether this could reasonably occur without misconduct:

1. **Natural statistical distributions**: In genuine research, p-values should follow a relatively uniform or smoothly decreasing distribution. There's no natural statistical reason why values would cluster just below .05 while being absent just above this threshold.

2. **Publication bias without personal manipulation**: The scientific community has a well-documented preference for statistically significant results (p < .05). However, this typically manifests as entire studies going unpublished, not as manipulated p-values within a single study.

3. **Multiple analyses without correction**: Running many analyses (multiple comparisons) can increase the likelihood of finding significant results by chance. However, this would produce p-values distributed across the range below .05, not specifically clustered just below the threshold.

4. **Small sample biases**: Small samples can produce unstable p-values, but this would not explain the specific pattern of values clustering just below .05 with an absence above.

5. **Selective reporting without data manipulation**: A researcher might conduct many analyses and only report the significant ones. However, this still wouldn't explain why values cluster just below .05 rather than being distributed throughout the significant range.

The specific pattern described - concentration just below .05 with almost none just above - is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate statistical processes or innocent researcher decisions. This pattern has been extensively studied in meta-scientific research and is considered a strong indicator of p-hacking (selectively analyzing data until reaching significance).

While not absolutely impossible without misconduct, this distribution pattern is highly implausible under normal statistical conditions and legitimate research practices.

I need to consider how likely it is that excluding some participants from the initial dataset would occur in the normal course of ethical research.

In legitimate scientific research, there are many valid reasons to exclude participants from a final analysis:

1. Participants who didn't follow instructions properly
2. Participants who failed attention or comprehension checks
3. Technical issues during data collection
4. Outliers identified through pre-specified criteria
5. Participants who didn't complete the full study
6. Participants who reported post-experiment awareness of hypotheses
7. Data quality concerns identified through objective criteria

Importantly, in ethical research, exclusion criteria should ideally be determined before data analysis begins. However, it's also common that some issues only become apparent during analysis. For example, researchers might discover that some participants misunderstood instructions or that equipment malfunctioned for certain sessions.

What would make the exclusions suspicious would be if:
- They were done selectively to achieve statistical significance
- The criteria weren't reported transparently
- The exclusions weren't justified by methodological concerns

Without specific information about why the participants were excluded, I can only assess the general likelihood. Participant exclusion is a common, normal part of research when done according to principled criteria. The fact that an earlier script shows more participants is by itself not unusual - the question is whether the exclusions were legitimate or done to manipulate the results.

Given that participant exclusion is quite common in cognitive neuroscience research, and assuming Lena did not commit misconduct, it's highly likely that she would have legitimate reasons to exclude some participants between an early and final analysis.

Probability: 85
This situation describes a serious breach of preregistration principles. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data, as this introduces researcher degrees of freedom that invalidate statistical inferences.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the preregistration was modified after data collection in this manner? Let me analyze this:

In ethical research conduct, preregistration documents should never be altered after data collection begins, especially not to change exclusion criteria or primary outcomes. The entire purpose of preregistration is to commit to analysis decisions before seeing the data to prevent bias.

However, there are a few non-misconduct scenarios that could explain this:

1. **Administrative error**: Someone might have made formatting changes or corrections to typos in the preregistration document without understanding that any modification after data collection is inappropriate.

2. **Misunderstanding of preregistration principles**: Lena might genuinely not have understood that modifying a preregistration post-data collection fundamentally undermines its purpose. This would reflect poor research training rather than intentional misconduct.

3. **Technical issues**: Perhaps the file was opened and automatically saved with a new timestamp despite no substantive changes being made.

4. **Transparent amendments**: In some cases, researchers might document necessary deviations from the preregistration in transparent amendments (though this should be done in a separate amendment document, not by modifying the original).

These scenarios, while possible, are generally unlikely because:

- Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically (not just correcting typos) suggests substantive changes
- Changes to these particular elements directly affect the statistical outcomes
- Any researcher trained in modern methods should understand that this undermines preregistration

Even in a charitable interpretation where Lena didn't intend to mislead, modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents, at minimum, a serious methodological error that violates core principles of scientific integrity.

Probability: 15
This pattern of p-values described—many just below the .05 threshold and very few just above it—is what statisticians call a "p-value pile-up" or "p-hacking signature." This distribution is highly suspicious and difficult to explain through legitimate research practices.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, let me consider possible innocent explanations:

1. **Random chance**: By pure coincidence, multiple analyses could yield p-values just under .05. However, the probability of this happening naturally across "several exploratory analyses" is extremely low. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Even if effects are real, there's no natural reason for p-values to cluster just below the significance threshold.

2. **Publication bias in methodology selection**: Over time, fields sometimes gravitate toward methods that tend to produce significant results. However, this would not explain the specific absence of p-values just above .05.

3. **Undisclosed multiple analyses with selective reporting**: Lena might have run many analyses and only reported the significant ones without realizing this invalidates the p-values. This would be a methodological error rather than deliberate fraud, though it sits in a gray area.

4. **Statistical software quirks**: Some statistical procedures might be more likely to produce certain p-values, but no legitimate statistical method would systematically avoid values just above .05 while producing many just below it.

The distribution described is almost exactly what we would expect to see from data manipulation. Statistical research has shown that this pattern—many p-values just below .05 and an unusual "drop" just above .05—is a strong indicator of questionable research practices or outright p-hacking.

The main exploratory finding had p = .01, which doesn't fit this pattern, but the multiple secondary analyses with p-values clustering just below .05 is highly unlikely to occur naturally without some form of selective analysis, data exclusion, or manipulation.

Given the specific pattern described, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of seeing this distribution is very low.

Probability: 5
These email statements reflect the unfortunate realities of academic pressure that many researchers face, especially early-career scientists like PhD students. Let me analyze how likely these statements would be even if Lena did not commit misconduct:

1. **"Counting on this study to save the grant"**: This reflects a common dynamic in academic labs where continued funding depends on producing "successful" results. Principal investigators often communicate these pressures to their students, sometimes explicitly. A student feeling this weight is very common, even among those who maintain research integrity.

2. **"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc"**: This sadly reflects the publication bias in academia where null results are less likely to be published in prestigious journals, and publication record significantly impacts career prospects. Many honest researchers accurately perceive this reality and worry about it.

3. **"I need this one to work"**: This phrasing is ambiguous. "Work" could mean:
   - The experiment needs to be executed properly
   - The data collection needs to go smoothly
   - The hypothesis needs to be supported

While concerning if it means the third interpretation, many researchers use such language to express hope for their hypotheses without actually intending to manipulate data.

These statements reveal:
- Awareness of publication bias and career incentives
- Pressure from supervisors and the academic system
- Career anxiety common among PhD students

None of these necessarily indicate misconduct. Researchers can feel these pressures, express them privately, yet still maintain scientific integrity in their work. Many scientists experience conflicts between what the incentive structure rewards versus what proper scientific method requires, without crossing ethical lines.

These concerns are so widespread in academia that they would be expressed by many researchers who never engage in misconduct. The statements show Lena was under pressure, but pressure alone doesn't determine whether someone commits misconduct.

# Analysis of Script Changes in Absence of Misconduct

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are several legitimate reasons why participants might have been excluded between an earlier analysis script and the final dataset:

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Pre-established exclusion criteria being applied**: It's common practice to exclude participants who:
   - Fail attention checks
   - Don't complete all parts of the experiment
   - Show evidence of not understanding instructions
   - Have technical issues during testing

2. **Outlier detection**: After initial data exploration, statistical outliers might be legitimately removed according to established procedures.

3. **Post-data collection realization of eligibility issues**: Discovering after testing that some participants didn't meet inclusion criteria (e.g., neurological conditions, medication use).

4. **Reviewer feedback**: The peer review process might have suggested applying different or more stringent exclusion criteria.

5. **Technical reasons**: The software switch mentioned might have revealed data quality issues that weren't apparent in earlier analyses.

## Standard Practice Considerations

Participant exclusion is normal in cognitive neuroscience research as long as:
- Exclusion criteria are applied systematically
- Exclusions are clearly documented and reported
- The rationale for exclusions is scientifically justified

Without evidence of p-hacking or selective reporting, finding an earlier script with more participants is entirely consistent with normal research progression and refinement, especially in complex neuroscience studies where data quality is paramount.

Given these considerations and that Lena has a "previously strong record of careful data handling," finding an earlier analysis script with more participants would be highly expected even if she committed no misconduct.

Probability: 90
# Analysis of Lena's Emails Without Misconduct

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her emails still reflect very common sentiments in academic research, particularly for PhD students in high-pressure environments.

## Context of Academic Pressure Without Misconduct

1. **Grants and career pressure are real**: The statements about her supervisor "counting on this study to save the grant" likely reflect the genuine pressure in academic labs where funding continuity is essential. This does not necessarily mean she fabricated data in response to this pressure.

2. **Publication bias affects career prospects**: Saying "a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" acknowledges the unfortunate reality that null results are harder to publish and less valued on academic CVs. This is a systemic problem in science that many honest researchers lament.

3. **"I need this one to work" has multiple interpretations**: This could mean:
   - She hopes the experiment runs smoothly without technical problems
   - She hopes participants follow instructions properly
   - She hopes the theoretical framework is supported by genuine data
   - She's anxious about the outcome but committed to reporting it honestly

## Common Academic Communication

Many researchers privately express:
- Anxiety about the outcome of their experiments
- Frustration with the publication system that rewards positive findings
- Concern about career implications of their work
- Awareness of their supervisor's expectations

These communications reflect the problematic incentive structures in academia rather than necessarily indicating personal misconduct. In fact, candid acknowledgment of these pressures in private correspondence is extremely common among honest researchers who nevertheless maintain their integrity in their actual work.

Given how pervasive these sentiments are in academic research, it would be quite likely for Lena to express these exact concerns even if she maintained complete integrity in her research practices.

Probability: 85
# Analysis of P-value Distribution Without Misconduct

The described distribution of p-values—with an unusually high concentration just below .05 and almost none just above—is a statistical pattern that demands careful consideration.

## Statistical Expectations Without Misconduct

If null hypotheses were true and analyses were conducted properly without p-hacking:
- P-values should be approximately uniformly distributed between 0 and 1
- There should be no systematic clustering just below significance thresholds
- The frequency of p-values between .04-.05 should be roughly similar to those between .05-.06

## Possible Innocent Explanations

1. **Random chance**: While possible, the probability of getting many p-values just below .05 and almost none just above by chance alone is extremely low.

2. **Publication bias effects**: The research community's preference for significant results might influence study design or power calculations, but this typically doesn't produce such a sharp discontinuity exactly at p=.05.

3. **Undisclosed multiple comparisons**: Lena might have run numerous legitimate exploratory analyses without proper correction, which could shift the distribution but rarely in this specific pattern.

4. **Flexibility in analysis**: Even without deliberate misconduct, there might be unconscious researcher degrees of freedom in how data are processed, but again, this typically doesn't create such a stark pattern.

## Scientific Literature on P-value Distributions

This specific pattern (clustering just below .05 with few values just above) has been extensively studied in meta-science. Research by Simonsohn, Nelson & Simmons (2014), Head et al. (2015), and others shows that this pattern is highly improbable under conditions of research integrity and is considered one of the strongest statistical signatures of p-hacking.

Without misconduct, the probability of observing this distinctive pattern specifically in exploratory analyses (which have greater analytical flexibility) is extremely low.

Probability: 15
# Analysis of Post-Data Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analytical decisions before seeing the data.

## Legitimate Explanations Are Limited

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are very few plausible explanations for such modifications:

1. **Administrative correction of genuine errors**: If the original preregistration contained clear mistakes that did not reflect the actual planned methodology, corrections might be justified. However, this would typically:
   - Be documented transparently as an amendment
   - Not involve changing primary outcomes (which is particularly problematic)
   - Be accompanied by justification for the changes

2. **Technical or administrative confusion**: Someone might have uploaded an updated version of the document without understanding the implications, especially given the mentioned software transition in the lab.

3. **Genuine misunderstanding of preregistration practices**: Lena might have misunderstood that preregistration modifications after data collection fundamentally undermine its purpose, though this is unlikely for a third-year PhD student in a research-intensive environment.

## Problematic Aspects Even Without Intent

Even if Lena did not intentionally commit misconduct, these actions represent a serious violation of scientific best practices:
- Changing primary outcomes after seeing data is recognized across scientific disciplines as inappropriate
- Modifying exclusion criteria after data collection enables inadvertent p-hacking
- The timestamp evidence means these changes were not transparently disclosed

## Evaluation of Likelihood

The scientific community and research integrity offices generally consider post-data preregistration modifications to primary outcomes as one of the clearest violations of research integrity. Without misconduct, there are so few legitimate explanations for such modifications that the probability must be very low.

This action fundamentally contradicts the purpose of preregistration and, when combined with the pattern of p-values and selective participant exclusion, is extremely difficult to explain through honest error.

I need to assess how likely Lena would send these emails if she were innocent of academic misconduct.

The emails express:
1. Pressure from her supervisor regarding grant funding
2. Concern about her postdoc prospects if the study fails
3. A statement about "needing this one to work"

These statements reflect common pressures in academia:

**Publication pressure is widespread in academia**
- "Publish or perish" culture is well-documented in scientific research
- PhD students commonly feel pressure to produce positive results
- Grant renewals often depend on successful findings

**Career concerns are normal**
- Postdoc positions are highly competitive
- Publication record significantly affects job prospects
- Third-year PhD students are typically concerned about their future career path

**The phrase "need this one to work"**
- Could mean hoping for statistically significant results (problematic)
- But could also mean hoping the experiment goes smoothly, data collection works properly, or that the research design is effective (not problematic)
- Ambiguous wording that might reflect anxiety rather than intent to falsify

**Important context**
- These were private emails to a friend, where venting is common
- The language reflects the pressure she feels, not necessarily intent to commit fraud
- Such sentiments are unfortunately common among researchers at her career stage

If Lena were innocent, expressing these concerns to a friend would be quite normal given the pressures of academia. Many honest researchers feel and express similar anxieties. The statements show career anxiety, not necessarily fraudulent intent.

Probability judgment: 75
I need to evaluate how likely this p-value pattern would be if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

The described pattern - many p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 - is statistically suspicious for several reasons:

**Statistical distribution expectations:**
- If null hypotheses were being tested honestly, p-values should follow a uniform distribution (or be skewed toward 1.0 if there are true effects)
- There is no natural statistical mechanism that would create a discontinuity or "bunching" precisely at the conventional significance threshold of .05
- The absence of values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .052) is particularly telling

**Known patterns in legitimate research:**
- While p-values tend to cluster below significance thresholds in the published literature (publication bias), this happens at the journal level through selection
- Within a single researcher's raw dataset, such a pattern is highly unusual without some form of data manipulation
- Even with researcher degrees of freedom, it's unlikely to produce this specific pattern without intentional p-hacking

**Innocent explanations:**
- Multiple analysis approaches or reasonable exclusion criteria could push some borderline results to significance
- Exploratory analyses might involve trying different statistical models
- However, these would typically still produce some p-values just above .05

**The specific context:**
- This pattern appears in exploratory analyses, which have fewer constraints and more researcher flexibility
- The described bunching is not just at .05 but specifically concentrated just below it
- The description notes this is "unusually high" concentration, suggesting it's beyond normal statistical variation

The pattern described is a classic signature of p-hacking (selecting analyses, exclusion criteria, or making other choices specifically to achieve statistical significance). While not impossible under innocent circumstances, it is highly unlikely to occur naturally without intentional efforts to push results below the significance threshold.

Probability judgment: 10
I need to evaluate how likely it would be for Lena to modify the preregistration document after data collection if she were not committing academic misconduct.

**Purpose of preregistration:**
- Preregistration exists specifically to prevent post-hoc changes to analysis plans
- The scientific validity of preregistration depends on finalizing plans before seeing data
- Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines the purpose of preregistration

**Legitimate reasons for post-data modifications:**
- Genuine documentation errors might be discovered and corrected
- Technical clarifications that don't substantively change the analysis plan
- Transparent amendments with clear justification (but these would typically be added as amendments, not modifications to the original document)

**Problems with the specific modifications:**
- Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data could allow selective removal of participants who don't support the hypothesis
- Modifying primary outcomes after data collection allows switching to measures that happened to show significant results
- These particular types of changes are especially problematic as they directly affect the main findings

**Standard scientific practice:**
- Proper procedure would be to report deviations from the preregistration in the paper
- Modifications should be transparent and justified
- Original preregistration should remain unchanged with amendments added separately

**Innocent explanations:**
- Confusion about preregistration procedures (especially for early-career researchers)
- Mistakenly thinking preregistration can be updated to reflect actual procedures
- Software/technical issues requiring document re-upload

Even with innocent explanations, modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes represents a serious violation of research integrity principles. While a researcher might make this mistake out of ignorance rather than intentional fraud, it's difficult to reconcile with proper scientific conduct, especially for someone at the PhD level who should understand the purpose of preregistration.

Probability judgment: 15
I need to evaluate how likely it would be to find different participant counts between earlier and final analysis scripts if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

**Legitimate reasons for participant exclusion:**
- Discovering data quality issues during analysis (e.g., equipment malfunction, participant non-compliance)
- Realizing some participants don't meet inclusion criteria that wasn't initially screened
- Identifying outliers based on pre-specified criteria
- Finding participants who didn't complete all required tasks
- Applying exclusion criteria that were in the preregistration but not initially implemented

**Normal analysis workflow considerations:**
- Iterative refinement of analysis scripts is common in research
- Initial scripts often include all collected data before applying exclusion criteria
- Legitimate data cleaning happens in stages, with early versions typically having fewer exclusions
- Documentation of exclusion decisions should exist, even if the process is legitimate

**Contextual factors:**
- The change in participant count alone doesn't indicate misconduct
- What matters is whether exclusions followed predetermined criteria
- The legitimacy depends on whether exclusions were documented and justified
- Timing relative to seeing results is critical (which we don't know from this information alone)

**Best practices vs. common practices:**
- While best practice is to blind yourself to results when making exclusion decisions, many researchers don't follow this
- Poor documentation of exclusion decisions is unfortunately common even in legitimate research
- Many researchers apply exclusion criteria post-hoc without fraudulent intent

Without knowing the specific reasons for the exclusions, their relationship to the preregistration, or whether they were documented and justified, there are many innocent explanations for different participant counts between versions. However, this must be considered alongside the other evidence, particularly the modified preregistration and suspicious p-value patterns.

# Analysis of p-value Distribution Pattern

The pattern of p-values described - many just below .05 and very few just above - is a recognized statistical anomaly that raises significant concerns in scientific research. Let me analyze how likely this pattern would be if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

## Natural p-value distributions

In genuine research without p-hacking or data manipulation:
- P-values should distribute relatively uniformly when the null hypothesis is true
- When there are true effects, p-values tend to skew toward smaller values (0.01, 0.001, etc.)
- There is no natural statistical mechanism that would create a sharp "cliff" or discontinuity precisely at p = 0.05

## Potential innocent explanations

1. **Random chance**: While statistically possible, the specific clustering described is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.

2. **Multiple analyses with selective reporting**: Lena may have conducted many analyses and only reported the significant ones (p < .05) in the paper. This is a questionable research practice but different from fabrication.

3. **Post-hoc adjustments**: Lena might have made legitimate data cleaning decisions, exclusion criteria, or covariate selections that inadvertently pushed borderline results to significance.

4. **Confirmation bias in analysis choices**: She might have unconsciously favored analytical approaches that yielded significant results.

5. **Software issues**: The mentioned software change could potentially create systematic errors, though this would rarely manifest specifically as p-values clustered just below .05.

## Statistical assessment

The pattern described (many p-values just below .05 and very few just above) is widely considered a red flag in statistical auditing. This pattern is commonly associated with:
- P-hacking (running analyses until finding significance)
- Selective reporting
- Data manipulation

Such a distributional anomaly specifically at the significance threshold has an extremely low probability of occurring naturally, particularly across multiple analyses. This pattern has been extensively documented in the scientific literature as evidence of questionable research practices or misconduct.

The probability that this specific p-value distribution would appear naturally in Lena's dataset without any form of misconduct or questionable research practices is very low.

# Analysis of Preregistration Modifications After Data Collection

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a serious deviation from proper scientific practice. Let me assess how likely this would occur without deliberate misconduct.

## Purpose of preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making post-hoc decisions that could bias results. The core scientific value of preregistration is that it documents decisions made before seeing the data, preventing researchers from tailoring analyses to reach desired outcomes. Changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are particularly concerning as these directly impact statistical significance.

## Legitimate scenarios for post-data modifications

There are a few limited scenarios where modifications might occur without deliberate misconduct:

1. **Administrative errors**: Researchers might update a document to fix typos, formatting issues, or clarify ambiguous language without changing the substantive content.

2. **Documentation of deviations**: Some preregistration platforms allow amendments to note deviations from the original plan, but these should be transparently labeled as post-hoc changes.

3. **Technical misunderstanding**: A junior researcher like Lena might mistakenly believe it's acceptable to "update" the preregistration document rather than filing an amendment or documenting deviations separately.

4. **Workflow confusion**: During software transitions or collaborative work, files might be saved with new timestamps without substantive changes.

## Problematic aspects in this specific case

Several factors make innocent explanations less plausible:

1. **Nature of the changes**: Modifications to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are precisely the types of changes that would allow researchers to "find" significance in otherwise non-significant data.

2. **Timing**: Changes occurring after data collection but before submission suggest the modifications were made with knowledge of how they would affect results.

3. **No transparency**: There's no indication that these changes were openly documented as amendments or deviations.

4. **Context**: The pressure from Professor Mills to produce publishable findings provides motivation for questionable modifications.

## Assessment

While there are some scenarios where preregistration documents might be modified after data collection without deliberate misconduct, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically represents a fundame# Likelihood of Multiple Analysis Scripts Without Misconduct

The existence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria as part of a documented lab-wide robustness initiative significantly changes the interpretation of this evidence. This pattern is highly consistent with legitimate research practices, particularly modern approaches to robust science.

## Legitimate multiverse/robustness analysis practices

The described pattern aligns well with recommended scientific practices:

1. **Multiverse analysis** - A recognized approach where researchers run analyses under different reasonable analytical decisions to test robustness of findings
2. **Sensitivity testing** - Deliberate variation of exclusion criteria to ensure results aren't dependent on specific analytical choices
3. **Transparency initiatives** - Many labs now systematically explore multiple analysis pathways as part of open science practices

## Lab-wide context is crucial

The fact that this was:
- Part of a documented "lab-wide push"
- Showing similar patterns across multiple students
- Systematically exploring both stricter AND looser criteria
- Properly logged in official data management systems

These elements strongly suggest an institutionalized practice rather than individual manipulation.

## Modern methodological standards

In contemporary cognitive neuroscience:
- Robustness checks are increasingly expected by journals
- Methodological transparency is considered best practice
- Exploring parameter space is encouraged in complex analyses
- Documenting alternative analyses is part of thorough research

## Legitimate execution patterns

How robustness testing is properly conducted:
- Multiple analytical pathways are pre-specified
- Results across different specifications are compared
- Primary analyses are clearly distinguished from robustness checks
- Divergent results are acknowledged rather than hidden

## Appropriate documentation

The fact that these analyses were:
- Stored in official lab logs
- Not hidden or concealed
- Conducted similarly by other lab members
- Part of an explicit robustness initiative

These factors strongly suggest proper scientific practice rather than concealment.

## Conclusion

This evidence shows a pattern highly consistent with legitimate robust analysis practices. The lab-wide nature and systematic approach to both stricter and looser criteria suggest methodological thoroughness rather than selective reporting. This type of systematic robustness testing represents best practices in modern science rather than misconduct.

Probability that these multiple analysis scripts would exist without misconduct: 90

I'll analyze the likelihood of observing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

This pattern is concerning for several reasons:

1. **P-value distribution expectation**: In genuine research, p-values typically follow a uniform or slightly right-skewed distribution when the null hypothesis is true. When examining multiple exploratory analyses, we'd expect to see p-values distributed across the range, including values just above .05.

2. **The "p-hacking" signature**: The described pattern (many values just below .05, few just above) is a classic signature of p-hacking - where researchers manipulate analyses until they achieve statistical significance. This could involve trying different exclusion criteria, covariates, or analysis methods until finding a significant result.

3. **Exploratory analyses vulnerability**: The fact that this pattern appears in "exploratory analyses" is particularly noteworthy, as these are precisely the analyses where researchers have more flexibility in analytical choices.

4. **Probability of natural occurrence**: The probability of naturally observing multiple p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above is extremely low without some form of selection bias or data manipulation.

Potential innocent explanations:
- Publication bias (only reporting significant findings)
- Unconscious p-hacking (making seemingly justified analytical choices that happen to produce significant results)
- Selective reporting of analyses that "worked"
- Software issues during the transition period

However, the specific clustering described is statistically unlikely to occur by chance alone. While these explanations might account for some bias toward significant results, the sharp discontinuity around .05 (many just below, almost none just above) is difficult to explain through innocent means.

This pattern represents one of the strongest statistical red flags for potential data manipulation in research.

Probability judgment: 15
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are several legitimate reasons why participants might be excluded between an earlier analysis script and the final dataset:

1. **Routine data cleaning**: It's standard practice in cognitive neuroscience to exclude participants based on predefined criteria. This could include:
   - Participants who failed attention checks
   - Participants with excessive movement in neuroimaging tasks
   - Outliers based on reaction times or performance metrics
   - Participants who didn't complete all required tasks

2. **Technical issues**: As mentioned, the lab recently switched software, which could necessitate legitimate exclusions:
   - Data compatibility problems between systems
   - Recognition of previously undetected artifacts in some participants' data
   - Implementation of more rigorous quality control measures

3. **Pre-registered exclusion criteria**: If the study had pre-registered exclusion criteria that weren't initially applied but were implemented in the final analysis.

4. **Reviewer suggestions**: After initial submission, reviewers might have suggested applying standard exclusion criteria that weren't initially implemented.

5. **Correction of genuine errors**: Discovering that some participants were incorrectly included (e.g., didn't meet inclusion criteria, technical issues with their data collection).

6. **Post-study participant withdrawals**: Participants requesting their data be removed after initial analysis.

What makes this relatively likely in Lena's case:
- The context mentions she has "a previously strong record of careful data handling"
- The lab recently switched software, which could legitimately prompt reassessment
- Some files are missing due to a hard drive failure, potentially leading to reconstruction of analyses and discovering issues with certain participants

The key factor is whether these exclusions were:
- Based on objective criteria applied consistently
- Documented transparently
- Not selectively applied to achieve a desired outcome

Without evidence that the exclusions were motivated by the results they would produce, participant exclusions between analysis versions are quite common in legitimate research.

Probability judgment: 75
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be highly problematic and unlikely to have an innocent explanation.

Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making analysis decisions after seeing their data, as this introduces significant bias. The timeline of events here is particularly concerning:

1. **Fundamental breach of preregistration purpose**: The entire point of preregistration is to document analysis plans before data collection to prevent hindsight bias and p-hacking. Modifying these plans after seeing the data fundamentally undermines this purpose.

2. **Standard practice violations**: In legitimate research:
   - Preregistrations are timestamped and locked once finalized
   - Any deviations from preregistration should be transparently reported in publications
   - Changes to primary outcomes are especially problematic and rarely justifiable after data collection

3. **Limited innocent explanations**:
   - Clerical corrections (fixing typos, clarifying ambiguous language) might be acceptable but wouldn't typically involve changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes
   - Technical issues with the registration platform might necessitate re-uploading, but shouldn't involve substantive changes
   - Documentation of unanticipated problems might be added, but should be clearly marked as post-hoc

4. **Contextual factors**: Even considering Lena's previously strong record, the combination of:
   - Changing exclusion criteria after data collection
   - Modifying primary outcomes after seeing results
   - Not transparently documenting these changes
   - The unusual p-value distribution in the final analysis
   
   makes an innocent explanation highly unlikely.

While Lena might claim these changes were oversights, clarifications, or responses to unforeseen methodological issues, the specific nature of the changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) are precisely the elements that would be modified to achieve desired statistical outcomes.

The timeline evidence directly contradicts research integrity principles, making an innocent explanation very unlikely.

Probability judgment: 10
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's still quite plausible that she would write these kinds of emails to a friend. These statements reflect the very real pressures and anxieties experienced by many PhD students in competitive academic environments.

Here's why these comments are compatible with maintaining research integrity:

1. **Acknowledging career realities**: 
   - It's factually true that null results are often harder to publish, especially in high-impact journals
   - Many PhD students genuinely worry about their publication record affecting postdoc opportunities
   - These statements simply demonstrate awareness of the publication biases in academia

2. **Expressing supervisor pressure**:
   - The statement about her supervisor "counting on this study to save the grant" may reflect actual pressure communicated to her
   - Many labs depend on continued grant funding for survival
   - Acknowledging this pressure doesn't mean she acted on it inappropriately

3. **Emotional venting**:
   - Private emails to friends frequently contain expressions of anxiety and stress
   - "I need this one to work" can express hope rather than intent to manipulate
   - This could reflect emotional investment in her research rather than willingness to compromise integrity

4. **Common experience**:
   - These sentiments are widely shared among graduate students
   - Many researchers feel pressure to produce significant results
   - Experiencing this pressure doesn't mean yielding to it unethically

5. **Contextual factors**:
   - The emails were private venting to a friend, not declarations of intent
   - Many researchers with complete integrity acknowledge these systemic pressures
   - The statements demonstrate awareness of problematic incentives, not necessarily capitulation to them

These statements reflect the reality of academic incentives that many researchers navigate while maintaining their integrity. They demonstrate that Lena understood the stakes, but don't prove she compromised her ethics in response to these pressures.

Probability judgment: 80

I need to evaluate how likely Lena's email statements would be if she did not commit academic misconduct.

These kinds of statements reflect the reality of pressures in academic research environments, rather than necessarily indicating fraudulent intent:

1. "Supervisor counting on this study to save the grant" - This accurately describes the pressure many PIs place on lab members, especially when funding is at stake. Even honest researchers would acknowledge this pressure.

2. "A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" - This reflects the publication bias in academia where positive results are more valued than null results, making career advancement harder with negative findings. Many honest researchers recognize this unfortunate reality.

3. "I need this one to work" - This could simply express hope for a successful experiment. Even honest scientists hope their experiments will yield meaningful results, especially given the career stakes.

These statements reveal career anxiety and awareness of publication pressures, but don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Many researchers openly discuss these pressures while maintaining research integrity. The statements show Lena understood the stakes, but don't prove she acted unethically in response to those pressures.

If anything, openly expressing these concerns to a friend might suggest transparency about the pressures she faced rather than concealing fraudulent behavior. Many honest researchers would make similar statements while still conducting their research with integrity.

Given the prevalence of these pressures in academia and how commonly they're discussed among researchers, I would say there's a high probability an honest researcher would make such statements.

75
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant procedural violation in research. Let me consider how likely this would be without intentional misconduct:

1. Purpose of preregistration - The core function of preregistration is to document analysis plans before seeing data, precisely to prevent researchers from altering methods to fit results they've already seen. Changing these elements after data collection fundamentally undermines this purpose.

2. Knowledge of proper procedures - As a third-year PhD student in neuroscience, Lena would almost certainly understand that modifying preregistration after data collection violates research norms. This isn't an obscure rule but a foundational principle of preregistration.

3. Legitimate reasons for post-data modification:
   - Genuine errors in the original document might need correction
   - Technical issues might require adjustment of methods
   - Reviewer feedback might suggest improvements

However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically are particularly problematic modifications because they directly influence which results are reported and how. These aren't minor technical adjustments but changes that can substantially alter conclusions.

For this to occur without misconduct, Lena would need to:
- Be genuinely unaware that modifying these elements violates preregistration principles
- Have made these changes transparently while documenting the timing and rationale
- Not have done this to achieve more favorable results

While honest errors can occur, the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) after seeing data makes this particularly difficult to explain as unintentional. These are precisely the elements researchers might change to obtain desired results.

A non-fraudulent explanation would need to involve extreme carelessness or fundamental misunderstanding of research methods that would be unusual in a third-year PhD student.

15
When considering whether this pattern could occur without academic misconduct, I need to evaluate legitimate reasons why participants might be excluded between an earlier and final analysis:

1. Data quality issues: Researchers often identify problematic data during analysis that wasn't apparent initially. This might include:
   - Participants who didn't follow instructions properly
   - Technical failures during data collection
   - Outliers identified through standard statistical procedures
   - Incomplete responses discovered during deeper analysis

2. Refinement of exclusion criteria: As analyses progress, researchers sometimes realize their initial criteria need adjustment for legitimate methodological reasons:
   - Compliance thresholds may be adjusted based on the distribution of the data
   - Attention check failures might be implemented more strictly
   - Demographics criteria might be applied more consistently

3. Honest correction: If participants were initially included who didn't meet the preregistered exclusion criteria, removing them would be appropriate correction.

However, this finding must be viewed alongside other concerning elements:
- The preregistration was modified after data collection
- The exclusion of these particular participants led to more favorable results
- The changes weren't transparently documented

Without misconduct, we would expect:
- Clear documentation of why participants were excluded
- Exclusions following preregistered criteria
- Transparency about changes to analysis plans
- Robustness checks showing results with and without exclusions

While participant exclusions can absolutely happen for legitimate reasons in the normal research process, the combination with modified preregistration is concerning. Still, software changes, learning better analysis techniques, or discovering genuine issues with certain participants' data could explain some exclusions innocently.

50
An unusually high concentration of p-values just below the significance threshold of .05 with an absence of values just above .05 is a statistical anomaly that's difficult to explain without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting.

Let me examine how likely this pattern would be without misconduct:

1. Statistical distribution principles: Under normal circumstances, p-values should follow a uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects. Neither distribution would naturally create a clustering just below .05 with a gap just above it.

2. Publication bias without individual misconduct: The scientific literature as a whole shows this pattern due to publication bias, but an individual dataset shouldn't exhibit this pattern unless:
   - Only reporting analyses that reached significance
   - Running multiple analyses until finding significant results
   - Adjusting analysis parameters until reaching significance

3. Potential legitimate explanations:
   - Extreme statistical coincidence (extremely unlikely)
   - Pre-planned analyses with strong theo# Analysis of Lena's Emails Without Misconduct

These email statements express significant career pressure and outcome-focused concerns. I'll analyze how likely such statements would be from someone not engaging in academic misconduct.

## Common academic pressures and their expression

1. **Publication pressure is widespread in academia**: Researchers frequently discuss the need for positive results to advance their careers. The "publish or perish" culture is well-documented across scientific disciplines.

2. **Grant-dependent research environments**: Many labs depend on continued grant funding, and researchers often internalize this pressure. Expressing concern about a supervisor's grant situation is common.

3. **Career stage vulnerability**: PhD students approaching the job market are particularly vulnerable to publication pressure. Concerns about postdoc prospects based on publication success are realistic and commonly expressed.

4. **Informal communication norms**: In private emails to friends, researchers often express anxiety, pressure, and hopes in more direct and emotional language than they would in professional contexts.

5. **Psychological investment in research**: Even without misconduct intentions, researchers naturally hope their theories are correct and their studies "work" (produce meaningful, publishable results).

## Contextual interpretation of specific phrases

- "Counting on this study to save the grant": Acknowledges the reality of grant-dependent research, not necessarily indicating willingness to manipulate results
  
- "A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc": Reflects accurate understanding of academic hiring practices that favor candidates with positive findings

- "I need this one to work": Could express hope rather than manipulation intent - researchers commonly use "work" to mean "yield interpretable, meaningful results" not just "support my hypothesis"

## Assessment

These statements reveal career pressure and outcome-focused thinking, which are problematic aspects of scientific culture but extremely common. Many researchers who maintain integrity despite these pressures would express similar sentiments in private communications.

Without additional context suggesting misconduct, these statements primarily reflect the reality of career incentives in science rather than misconduct intent. They indicate Lena understood the professional stakes involved, but don't necessarily indicate she would compromise her integrity in response to these pressures.

The probability that a researcher who is not committing misconduct would write emails expressing these kinds of career pressures and outcome concerns is quite high.

# Analysis of Technical Disruptions Without Misconduct

The combination of a lab software switch and a hardware failure represents common technical challenges in research environments. Let me analyze how likely these events would be without any connection to academic misconduct.

## Software transitions in research settings

1. **Common occurrence**: Research labs frequently update or change software packages for various legitimate reasons:
   - New versions offering improved capabilities
   - Department-wide standardization initiatives
   - Cost considerations when renewing licenses
   - Compatibility with newer operating systems or hardware
   - Methodological advances requiring different analytical tools

2. **Mid-project timing**: While not ideal, software transitions during ongoing projects are relatively common due to:
   - Annual license renewal cycles that don't align with research timelines
   - Institutional IT policies that may mandate software changes
   - Discovery of analytical needs not met by existing software
   - Collaborator requirements for specific software formats

## Hardware failures in academic settings

1. **Frequency of laptop failures**: Hard drive failures are among the most common hardware issues:
   - Research from data recovery companies suggests 3-5% of hard drives fail annually
   - Academic laptops often face intensive use and frequent transport
   - Older equipment provided by universities may have higher failure rates

2. **Verification element**: The IT department's confirmation provides independent verification that:
   - A genuine hardware failure occurred
   - It was reported and documented at the time
   - The timing aligns with the project timeline
   - The repair was officially processed

## Combined probability assessment

The co-occurrence of these events is not particularly unusual:
- Both are relatively common technical disruptions in research
- They are causally independent events (software change doesn't cause hard drive failures)
- The external verification from IT provides objective confirmation
- Missing files are a natural consequence of both transitions and hard drive failures

## Assessment

These technical disruptions represent routine challenges in research environments. The fact that the hard drive failure was contemporaneously reported to IT and verified through repair records strongly supports its legitimacy. Software transitions, while disruptive, are standard occurrences in academic research settings.

The probability that a researcher who is not committing misconduct would experience a lab software switch and a documented hard drive failure resulting in some missing files is quite high.

t researchers feel this pressure without resorting to misconduct.

3. **Hope for success**: Saying "I need this one to work" could simply express hope for a successful experiment rather than intent to manipulate data. Researchers naturally hope their studies will yield clear results, especially after investing significant time and effort.

5. **Normal academic discourse**: Such sentiments are unfortunately common in academic settings where career advancement often depends on positive results, creating systemic pressures that affect even the most ethical researchers.

These statements indicate Lena was aware of and feeling the pressure to produce significant results, but they don't necessarily imply she would cross ethical lines. Many researchers experience these pressures while maintaining integrity in their work.

# Analysis of Preregistration Modification Issue

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection is a serious deviation from proper research practices, as preregistration specifically exists to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing the data (which can lead to p-hacking or HARKing - Hypothesizing After Results are Known).

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are several possible explanations for why the preregistration document might have been modified:

1. **Genuine administrative error**: Lena might have updated the document to correct typos or clarify language without realizing this violated preregistration principles.

2. **Misunderstanding of preregistration requirements**: As a third-year PhD student, Lena might not fully understand that modifying a preregistration after data collection fundamentally undermines its purpose.

3. **Following supervisor's instructions**: Professor Mills, under publication pressure, might have instructed Lena to make these changes without explaining the ethical implications.

4. **Technical documentation**: She might have been documenting deviations from the original plan (which is acceptable if transparently reported) in the same document rather than creating a separate deviation document.

However, several factors make these innocent explanations less plausible:

- Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are precisely the types of modifications that most directly affect statistical significance
- These are substantive changes, not minor corrections
- The changes appear to have led to "clean" results and significant findings
- The whistleblower specifically flagged issues with the data looking "too perfect"

In scientific practice, changes to preregistered plans should be documented separately and transparently reported in publications, not silently modified in the original document. The specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) are particularly concerning as they directly influence statistical significance.

Overall, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of these specific modifications occurring innocently is relatively low.

# Analysis of Lena's Emails Assuming No Misconduct

These email statements reveal Lena's awareness of the pressures and stakes involved in her research, but they don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Let me analyze how likely these statements would be from someone not engaging in academic fraud:

1. **Supervisor "counting on this study to save the grant"**
   - This reflects the reality of academic funding pressure
   - PhD students are often acutely aware of their lab's funding situation
   - Supervisors commonly communicate grant dependencies to their students
   - Such pressure exists regardless of whether a student responds ethically or unethically

2. **"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc"**
   - This reflects awareness of publication bias in academia
   - Many fields still prioritize positive findings in hiring decisions
   - Junior researchers often accurately perceive that null results are harder to publish
   - This statement acknowledges the system's flaws without necessarily indicating intent to cheat

3. **"I need this one to work"**
   - Ambiguous phrasing that could mean:
     - Hope for a genuine positive finding
     - Determination to conduct the study well
     - Emotional investment in the project's success
     - Pressure to produce positive results (without specifying unethical means)

These statements demonstrate:
- Awareness of career incentives
- Understanding of publication pressures
- Anxiety about professional outcomes

A researcher who maintains integrity despite these pressures might very well express these exact sentiments while venting to a friend. The academic system creates these pressures regardless of how researchers choose to respond to them. Many honest researchers acknowledge and discuss these systemic pressures while still maintaining ethical standards.

Without other evidence of misconduct, these statements primarily reveal the problematic incentives in academia rather than proving dishonest behavior.

# Analysis of p-value Distribution Assuming No Misconduct

The described p-value distribution—many values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) and almost none just above .05—represents a statistically unusual pattern that requires careful evaluation.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, several factors could theoretically explain this distribution:

1. **Random chance**: By pure coincidence, the exploratory analyses might have produced this pattern. However, this is statistically improbable. In genuine research, p-values should be roughly uniformly distributed when the null hypothesis is true, or show a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects.

2. **Publication bias without data manipulation**: Lena might have conducted numerous exploratory analyses and only reported those that reached significance (p < .05) without actually manipulating data. While this is a questionable research practice, some researchers don't consider it "misconduct" in the same category as fabrication or falsification.

3. **Methodological choices without deliberate p-hacking**: She might have made reasonable analytic decisions that coincidentally led to this pattern, though the probability of this resulting in the specific clustering described is extremely low.

4. **Field-specific methodological conventions**: In some fields, certain analysis practices can produce non-uniform p-value distributions even without intentional misconduct.

However, multiple statistical studies have demonstrated that this specific pattern—a clustering of p-values just below .05 with a "drop-off" just above .05—is a telltale statistical fingerprint highly associated with p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern has been extensively documented in meta-scientific research as strongly indicative of selective reporting or data manipulation.

The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly problematic, as genuine research almost always produces some findings in this range. Their absence suggests that analyses producing such values were either modified or excluded.

For exploratory analyses specifically, this pattern is even more suspicious, as these analyses lack the protection of pre-specified hypotheses.

Probability: 10
# Analysis of Participant Exclusions Assuming No Misconduct

Participant exclusions between early and final versions of analysis scripts can occur for legitimate reasons in research. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, several valid explanations could account for these exclusions:

1. **Refinement of exclusion criteria**: As analyses progress, researchers often identify valid methodological reasons to exclude certain participants, such as:
   - Discovering protocol violations not initially apparent
   - Identifying outliers based on objective statistical criteria
   - Recognizing data quality issues (e.g., equipment malfunctions)
   - Applying pre-registered exclusion criteria that weren't implemented in initial scripts

2. **Correction of coding errors**: Early analysis scripts might have incorrectly included participants who should have been excluded based on the original criteria.

3. **Data cleaning process**: Normal research workflow involves iterative data cleaning where problematic cases are identified and legitimately removed.

4. **Response to reviewer feedback**: If the script changes occurred after initial submission, reviewers might have suggested methodological improvements requiring different exclusion criteria.

5. **Incomplete data discovery**: Later review might have revealed that some participants had incomplete data on critical variables.

6. **Consultation with collaborators/supervisors**: Discussions with Professor Mills or others might have led to legitimate refinement of inclusion criteria.

However, the context raises some concerns:
- The preregistration was modified after data collection
- The presence of suspicious p-value distributions
- The timing relative to the whistleblower's claims

Even without misconduct, the exclusion of participants after initial analysis represents a deviation from best practices if:
- It wasn't transparently reported
- It wasn't based on pre-registered criteria
- It was done without blinding to how the exclusions affected results

While participant exclusions can be legitimate, their coincidence with other questionable practices in this case lowers the probability that they were entirely innocent.

I'll analyze the likelihood of having participants excluded from the final dataset if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

In legitimate research, there are several valid reasons why participants might be excluded between an earlier analysis and the final analysis:

1. Exclusion criteria applied after initial data collection: Researchers often set predetermined exclusion criteria (like attention check failures, incomplete responses, or outlier detection) that are applied systematically after data collection.

2. Data quality issues discovered during analysis: During data processing, researchers might identify participants who misunderstood instructions, experienced technical problems, or provided unusable data.

3. Reviewer suggestions: After initial submission or during pre-registration review, reviewers may suggest more stringent exclusion criteria that better align with methodological standards.

4. Power analyses: After preliminary analysis, researchers might realize they need fewer participants than initially collected to achieve adequate statistical power.

5. Protocol violations identified after initial analysis: Some participants might have been found to deviate from the experimental protocol in ways not immediately apparent.

In cognitive neuroscience specifically, participant exclusion is quite common due to:
- Movement artifacts in brain imaging data
- Poor task performance indicating lack of engagement
- Equipment malfunctions during data collection
- Participants not meeting inclusion criteria that could only be verified during testing

The fact that the lab switched software recently could explain why the exclusion criteria might appear in later but not earlier scripts, as the implementation method might have changed.

Based on standard research practices in cognitive neuroscience, participant exclusion between analysis versions is extremely common and often necessary for methodological rigor. Without any evidence suggesting the exclusions were done to manipulate results, this would be considered normal scientific practice.

Probability judgment: 85
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is generally problematic in research practice, even without fraudulent intent. Let me analyze the likelihood of this happening without academic misconduct:

1. Legitimate modifications to preregistration are possible, but they should be:
   - Transparently documented with clear rationales
   - Clearly labeled as post-hoc changes
   - Not driven by knowledge of results

2. Innocent explanations could include:
   - Administrative errors (updating the wrong file)
   - Technical issues during initial submission (needing to fix incomplete uploads)
   - Clarifying ambiguous criteria without substantively changing them

3. However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically after seeing the data is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of preregistration, which exists to prevent researcher degrees of freedom and p-hacking.

4. In proper research practice, changes after data collection would typically:
   - Be documented in a separate amendment
   - Be analyzed as exploratory rather than confirmatory
   - Be explicitly acknowledged in the final paper

5. The field of cognitive neuroscience increasingly emphasizes preregistration integrity, making such changes without proper documentation unusual for a third-year PhD student who should understand basic research integrity principles.

6. Even if done without fraudulent intent, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection shows either:
   - Severe misunderstanding of research methods
   - Carelessness about research integrity
   - Improper research training

While honest mistakes happen, modifying these specific elements of preregistration after data collection without proper documentation is extremely difficult to explain as an innocent error, particularly for someone at Lena's level of training. The probability that this would happen without any misconduct intention is quite low.

Probability judgment: 15
These email statements reflect the reality of academic pressure that many researchers, especially PhD students, experience. Let me analyze how likely such statements would be if Lena did not commit misconduct:

1. Publication pressure is endemic in academia:
   - The "publish or perish" culture is well-documented in scientific research
   - Grant renewals often depend on producing positive results
   - Career advancement, especially securing postdoc positions, is heavily tied to publication record

2. These statements express anxiety rather than intent to manipulate:
   - Saying her supervisor is "counting on this study to save the grant" describes external pressure, not misconduct plans
   - Worrying about postdoc chances reflects awareness of career realities, not fraudulent intent
   - "I need this one to work" can express hope for legitimate success rather than determination to fake results

3. Venting to friends about academic stress is extremely common:
   - PhD students regularly share anxieties about research outcomes with peers
   - Private communications often contain more emotional language than professional ones
   - Such venting serves as a coping mechanism for the pressures of academia

4. The statements acknowledge systemic problems in research:
   - They reflect the problematic incentive structures in science
   - Many honest researchers feel these exact pressures while maintaining integrity
   - Recognizing these pressures doesn't mean succumbing to them through misconduct

5. Context matters:
   - These statements don't describe specific plans to manipulate data
   - They don't indicate that Lena planned to falsify or fabricate results
   - They're consistent with a stressed student hoping for legitimate positive outcomes

Many honest researchers have expressed similar sentiments in private communications while still conducting their research with integrity. These statements reflect the unfortunate reality of academic incentives rather than evidence of misconduct. They're highly consistent with the normal anxieties experienced by PhD students under pressure.

Probability judgment: 85
An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 is a statistical pattern that's difficult to explain through legitimate research processes. Let me analyze how likely this would be without academic misconduct:

1. Natural p-value distributions in research:
   - When analyzing genuine data, p-values should distribute relatively uniformly if the null hypothesis is true
   - If there are true effects, we'd expect to see more very low p-values (e.g., p < .01), but not a specific clustering just below .05
   - The absence of p-values just above .05 creates an unnatural "cliff" in the distribution

2. Statistical unlikelihood:
   - This pattern specifically defies random chance
   - The clustering precisely at the traditional significance threshold (.05) rather than any other value suggests non-random forces
   - The lack of "near misses" (p-values just above .05) is particularly implausible in legitimate research

3. Potential legitimate explanations:
   - Small sample statistical flukes are possible but extremely unlikely across multiple analyses
   - Certain specialized statistical corrections might affect p-value distributions, but would rarely create this specific pattern
   - Some fields have built-in publication bias that could theoretically affect exploratory analyses, but this wouldn't explain the absence of values above .05

4. In exploratory analyses specifically:
   - Exploratory work typically produces a wide range of p-values
   - The pattern described is even less likely in exploratory rather than confirmatory analyses
   - Multiple exploratory tests should produce some results just above threshold by chance alone

5. Methodological considerations:
   - Even with legitimate exclusion criteria and careful analysis, this specific clustering pattern is statistically anomalous
   - No standard methodological approach in cognitive neuroscience naturally produces this p-value distribution
   - The pattern defies both statistical theory and empirical observations of p-value distributions in honest research

This pattern represents one of the strongest statistical red flags for potential p-hacking. The probability of this occurring naturally, especially across multiple exploratory analyses, is extremely low.

I need to evaluate how likely it would be for participants to be excluded from the final dataset if Lena did not commit misconduct.

In legitimate research, there are several valid reasons why participants might be excluded between an early analysis and the final dataset:

1. Pre-established exclusion criteria: Participants might be excluded based on criteria that were determined before the study (e.g., performance below a certain threshold, excessive movement during neuroimaging, failure to complete all tasks).

2. Quality control: After initial data collection, researchers might discover issues with certain participants' data (e.g., equipment malfunction, participant misunderstanding instructions).

3. Outlier detection: Statistical outliers might be identified and excluded based on objective criteria.

4. Reviewer feedback: Journal reviewers might suggest additional exclusion criteria or methodological improvements requiring participant exclusion.

5. Power analysis refinements: After initial analysis, researchers might determine they don't need all participants for adequate statistical power.

In cognitive neuroscience specifically, participant exclusion is common practice. Data quality issues, participant compliance problems, or technical issues during recording can all necessitate legitimate exclusions.

What would make this suspicious is if:
- The exclusions happened selectively to achieve significance
- The criteria weren't documented or were post-hoc
- The exclusions weren't reported transparently

However, if Lena is innocent, she would likely have documented valid reasons for these exclusions and applied them consistently. The fact that an earlier script exists with more participants is actually quite normal in research workflows - researchers often run preliminary analyses on full datasets before applying exclusion criteria.

Considering standard research practices, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it's highly likely that an earlier analysis script would include participants who were later legitimately excluded.

75
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, these emails still reflect common sentiments experienced by many PhD students under publication pressure, though they do reveal concerning contextual factors.

Even honest researchers frequently:

1. Experience career pressure: PhD students are acutely aware that publications affect their job prospects. Expressing concern about postdoc opportunities based on study outcomes is unfortunately common in academia's "publish or perish" culture.

2. Feel responsibility toward supervisors: Graduate students often feel personal responsibility for producing results that help their lab secure continued funding. The sentiment that her supervisor is "counting on this study to save the grant" reflects the real pressure in academic labs.

3. Express hope for positive outcomes: Saying "I need this one to work" could simply express hope for clean, interpretable results rather than a predetermined outcome. Researchers often want studies to "work" in terms of yielding clear answers, not necessarily confirming hypotheses.

4. Vent frustrations to friends: Private communications with friends are where academics often express anxieties they wouldn't state in professional contexts. These emails may represent emotional venting rather than stated intentions.

5. Use imprecise language: "Work" could mean many things - getting clean data, having sufficient statistical power, or completing the project on time - not necessarily getting a specific desired outcome.

The emails show Lena was under significant pressure, which is concerning but extremely common in academic research. Many honest researchers have similar private conversations about career pressure without resorting to misconduct. These statements reflect the problematic incentive structures in academia rather than definitive evidence of misconduct.

If Lena didn't commit misconduct, it's still quite likely she would write emails like these given the realistic pressures of PhD research.

70
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly problematic and unusual for a researcher with integrity. This action directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration, which is to establish analysis plans before seeing the data.

For an innocent explanation to be plausible:

1. Administrative error: She might have uploaded the wrong version initially or made formatting changes without intending to alter content.

2. Clarification without substantive changes: Sometimes researchers clarify ambiguous language without changing the actual planned analyses.

3. Technical error: The timestamp could reflect automated system updates rather than manual changes.

4. Documentation of deviations: She could have modified the document to transparently note deviations from the original plan (though this should be done as an amendment, not by altering the original).

5. Ignorance of proper procedure: As a student, she might not have fully understood that preregistrations should remain unchanged after data collection.

However, these explanations are weak because:

- Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data is a serious methodological issue that most trained researchers understand is inappropriate
- Modifying primary outcomes after data collection is one of the clearest forms of questionable research practices
- The timestamp evidence shows a pattern that aligns perfectly with p-hacking behavior
- Proper procedure would be to document deviations in the final paper, not alter the preregistration

Even if Lena had no fraudulent intent, this modification represents at minimum a serious deviation from proper scientific practice. If she truly did not commit misconduct, this timestamp evidence would be highly unusual and difficult to explain innocently.

25
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this distribution of p-values is highly suspicious and difficult to explain through legitimate research practices.

In genuine research with no manipulation:

1. Expected distribution: P-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution with values concentrated near zero when there are true effects.

2. No "cliff" at .05: There should be no sharp discontinuity at the arbitrary threshold of .05. Finding many values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) and almost none just above .05 creates an unnatural "cliff" in the p-value distribution.

3. Exploratory analyses: The fact that this pattern appears in exploratory analyses is particularly concerning, as these would typically show more variability, not less.

4. Statistical improbability: The mathematical probability of so many values clustering just below the significance threshold by chance is extremely low.

Potential innocent explanations are very limited:

1. Extraordinary coincidence: By random chance, multiple analyses happened to yield p-values in this narrow range (statistically highly unlikely).

2. Publication bias in previous literature: If Lena based her analyses on previous published work, she might have unknowingly built on already-biased effects.

3. Unintentional researcher degrees of freedom: She might have made multiple analysis decisions that unintentionally pushed borderline results into significance.

However, these explanations are extremely weak given the specific pattern described. The clustering of p-values just below .05 with an absence just above .05 is one of the strongest statistical fingerprints of p-hacking or data manipulation in research.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, this p-value distribution would be extremely unusual and difficult to explain through legitimate research processes.

I need to consider how likely it would be to see post-data-collection modifications to a preregistration document if Lena did not commit misconduct.

Preregistration documents are explicitly designed to prevent researchers from adjusting their analysis plans after seeing the data, as this creates researcher degrees of freedom that invalidate statistical inference. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious violation of research integrity principles.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, possible explanations include:

1. Technical/clerical errors: Perhaps Lena made minor formatting corrections or clarifications without substantive changes to the analysis plan, but timestamps make it appear that the entire document was modified.

2. Miscommunication: Lena may have misunderstood preregistration protocols, believing it was acceptable to update the document to reflect what she actually did (rather than creating a transparent deviation report).

3. Poor research practices but not deliberate fraud: Lena might have realized legitimate methodological issues after data collection began and updated the preregistration without understanding this violates scientific norms.

However, these explanations have significant weaknesses:

- Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (not minor edits) after seeing data is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of preregistration
- As a third-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience, Lena would likely understand preregistration principles
- The changes specifically to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (rather than other aspects) raises particular concern, as these are precisely the researcher degrees of freedom that most impact statistical results

Given the specifics here, particularly the modification of exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (which directly affect statistical significance), this would be highly unusual behavior for a researcher not engaging in questionable research practices.

Probability judgment: 15
I need to evaluate how likely it would be to see this unusual p-value distribution in the absence of academic misconduct.

When statistical analyses are conducted properly on genuine data, p-values should follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis or be skewed toward very small values when true effects exist. However, the described pattern - an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (the conventional significance threshold) with almost no values just above it - represents a discontinuity that is statistically implausible through legitimate research practices.

This specific pattern has been extensively studied in meta-scientific research and is widely recognized as a statistical fingerprint of p-hacking - the practice of manipulating analyses until results cross the significance threshold. 

If Lena did not commit misconduct, possible alternative explanations might include:

1. Extreme statistical coincidence - theoretically possible but extraordinarily improbable
2. Some unknown methodological quirk specific to this research paradigm
3. An unusual but genuine distribution of effects in this particular domain

However, these explanations face serious challenges:

- The statistical probability of such a clustering occurring naturally is extremely low
- The pattern appears specifically in "exploratory analyses" which typically have fewer constraints and more researcher flexibility
- The cluster appears precisely below the conventional significance threshold (.05), not at any other arbitrary point
- This pattern matches exactly what statistical analyses of publication bias and p-hacking predict

Studies examining p-value distributions across scientific literature have conclusively shown that this distinctive pattern is a reliable indicator of selective reporting or data manipulation. The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly telling, as it suggests analyses that didn't reach significance were either modified or discarded.

Probability judgment: 5
I need to evaluate how likely it would be to find excluded participants in the final dataset if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

Participant exclusions can be perfectly legitimate in research for several valid reasons:

1. Predetermined exclusion criteria: Participants might be legitimately excluded based on criteria established before data analysis (e.g., performance below chance level, technical failures during recording, or contaminated physiological data in neuroscience studies).

2. Data quality issues: In cognitive neuroscience, participants might be excluded due to excessive movement artifacts, poor task compliance, or equipment malfunctions discovered during data processing.

3. Outlier detection: Standard statistical procedures sometimes call for removing extreme outliers that could distort results, though this should follow pre-specified methods.

4. Protocol violations: Participants who didn't follow instructions or who disclosed post-experiment that they had prior knowledge of the hypotheses might be legitimately excluded.

However, several contextual factors make this specific case more concerning:

- The earlier preregistration modification already suggests changes to exclusion criteria after data collection
- The whistleblower specifically claimed data "looked too perfect"
- The pattern connects to the suspicious p-value distributions noted earlier

If Lena did not commit misconduct, plausible non-fraudulent explanations could include:
- She discovered legitimate methodological issues warranting exclusions
- She applied standard field practices for data cleaning that weren't fully documented in the preregistration
- The exclusions followed objective criteria that were simply applied later in the analysis process

While participant exclusions do occur in legitimate research, the combination with other suspicious elements makes this less likely to be innocent. However, considered in isolation, participant exclusions are a normal part of the research process, even if they should ideally be preregistered.

Probability judgment: 40
I need to evaluate how likely these email statements would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.

These statements reveal Lena's awareness of publication pressure and career incentives, which are unfortunately common realities in academic science. Many researchers, especially early-career scientists, experience these pressures without resorting to misconduct.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, these statements could reflect:

1. Normal career anxiety: PhD students often worry about their publication record affecting postdoc opportunities. Expressing concern about needing successful results is common among researchers at this career stage.

2. Awareness of the "file drawer problem": Researchers know that null results are harder to publish, especially in high-profile journals, creating natural anxiety about experiments "working."

3. Genuine pressure from her supervisor: Professor Mills might indeed be communicating that positive results are important for the grant renewal, creating stress without explicitly encouraging misconduct.

4. Venting to a friend: Private communications often contain expressions of worry, frustration, or pressure that don't necessarily translate to unethical action. The emails could represent emotional release rather than intent.

5. Hope for confirmatory results: Saying "I need this one to work" could simply express hope that the theory is correct and the experiment will successfully demonstrate it.

These statements do reveal concerning incentive structures in academia that can contribute to bias, but they don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Many researchers feel these pressures yet maintain scientific integrity in their work. The statements themselves are compatible with both honest research conducted under pressure and with misconduct motivated by that same pressure.

# Analysis of the p-value distribution pattern

The pattern described - an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 - is statistically very unusual if the research was conducted with integrity. Here's why:

## Expected p-value distribution
Under null hypothesis conditions, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. When there are true effects, we expect more small p-values (e.g., below .01), but the distribution around the arbitrary .05 threshold should still be roughly continuous.

## Why this pattern is suspicious
The clustering of p-values just below .05 with an abrupt drop-off above .05 creates what researchers call a "p-value cliff" or "p-hacking signature." This pattern strongly suggests selective reporting or data manipulation designed to achieve statistical significance.

## Alternative explanations
Could this pattern occur without misconduct?

1. **Random chance**: Extremely unlikely - the probability of multiple p-values naturally clustering just below .05 with none just above is mathematically improbable.

2. **Undisclosed multiple analyses**: Lena might have run many analyses and only reported those that were significant (p < .05), which constitutes p-hacking but might reflect poor research practices rather than fabrication.

3. **Analytical flexibility without documentation**: She might have tried different preprocessing steps, exclusion criteria, or analysis choices until finding "significant" results.

4. **Software peculiarities**: While software issues might explain some data anomalies, they wouldn't specifically target the area around p = .05.

## Conclusion
The described pattern is one of the strongest statistical red flags for data manipulation in scientific research. While technically possible by chance, such a distribution is vanishingly unlikely to occur naturally. Even accounting for the possibility of innocent explanations, the described pattern is highly inconsistent with unbiased data collection and analysis.

Probability judgment: 5
# Analysis of Post-Collection Preregistration Modifications

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researchers from making decisions that could be influenced by already-seen data.

## Legitimate reasons for post-data modifications

There are very few legitimate reasons to modify preregistration after data collection:

1. **Correction of clerical errors**: Simple typos or formatting issues might be fixed, but these wouldn't involve changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes.

2. **Documentation of deviations**: Researchers sometimes update preregistrations to transparently document necessary deviations from the original plan, but this is typically done by adding amendments rather than changing the original document itself.

3. **Technical failures**: Unforeseen technical problems might require adjustments, but these should be documented as deviations, not backdated changes.

## Why this is problematic

Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data allows researchers to selectively include/exclude participants to achieve desired results. Modifying primary outcomes allows researchers to highlight findings that worked while downplaying those that didn't.

## Standard practice in ethical research

The ethical approach when deviating from preregistration is:
- Keep the original preregistration intact
- Document all changes transparently in the manuscript
- Label any post-hoc analyses as exploratory
- Explain why deviations were necessary

## Contextual factors

Given that other evidence suggests p-hacking (clustering of p-values just below .05), the modification of the preregistration is particularly concerning. The two issues together strongly suggest intentional manipulation to achieve publishable results.

## Conclusion

While there are occasional legitimate reasons to document changes to a research plan, directly modifying the preregistration document to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is fundamentally contrary to scientific integrity and the principles of preregistration. The probability that this would occur without constituting misconduct is very low.

Probability judgment: 5
# Analysis of Lena's Email Statements Without Misconduct

These email statements reveal significant career pressure and outcome-focused concerns, but they don't necessarily prove misconduct occurred. Let me analyze what these statements might mean in the absence of deliberate academic fraud.

## Contextualizing the statements

1. **"Supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant"**
   - This likely reflects real pressure from above that many academics experience
   - Principal investigators often are dependent on positive results for continued funding
   - A student might accurately perceive and report this pressure without falsifying data

2. **"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc"**
   - This reflects a genuine reality in academic publishing where "null" findings are harder to publish
   - Publication record significantly impacts postdoc opportunities
   - Early-career researchers often correctly understand these incentive structures

3. **"I need this one to work"**
   - Could express hope rather than intention to manipulate
   - Might reflect anxiety about career prospects
   - Could indicate motivation to be especially thorough and careful

## Publication pressure in academia

These statements highlight the problematic "publish or perish" culture in academia. Many honest researchers feel these pressures acutely without committing misconduct. The statements reflect awareness of how science rewards positive findings, which is unfortunately a systemic issue.

## Alternative interpretations

Without misconduct, these emails might indicate:
- Venting frustration to a trusted friend
- Seeking emotional support during a stressful research process
- Acknowledging the reality of academic incentive structures
- Expressing hope for a successful outcome

## Consistency with honest research

Many ethical researchers have similar thoughts about career pressures but respond by:
- Being more thorough in their methods
- Planning stronger studies
- Preparing to frame null results in interesting ways
- Looking for meaningful patterns beyond the primary hypothesis

## Conclusion

While these statements reveal concerning pressure and outcome-focused motivation, they are relatively common sentiments in academia that don't necessarily lead to misconduct. Many researchers experience and express similar concerns while maintaining research integrity. That said, they do establish motive and pressure, which are relevant factors when considered alongside other evidence.

Probability judgment: 65
# Analysis of Participant Exclusion Without Misconduct

Excluding participants between analysis versions can be legitimate under certain circumstances. Let's examine when this might occur without constituting misconduct.

## Legitimate reasons for participant exclusion

1. **Application of preregistered exclusion criteria**: Researchers often identify outliers, non-compliant participants, or data quality issues during analysis. If these exclusions follow predetermined criteria, they represent good scientific practice.

2. **Technical issues discovered during analysis**: Problems like equipment malfunction, participant misunderstanding of instructions, or corrupted data files might only become apparent during initial data processing.

3. **Reviewer suggestions**: After peer review, researchers might legitimately apply more stringent exclusion criteria based on reviewer feedback, though this should be transparent.

4. **Protocol violations**: Participants who didn't follow instructions or meet inclusion criteria might be excluded after closer examination of their data.

5. **Iterative quality control**: Researchers might refine data cleaning procedures as they better understand the characteristics of their dataset.

## Concerning factors in this specific case

However, several contextual elements make this exclusion more suspicious:

1. The preregistration was modified after data collection, potentially to match these exclusions
2. The final results show p-values clustered just below significance thresholds
3. The exclusions appear in the context of other questionable patterns

## Key questions for determining legitimacy

Without misconduct, we would expect:
- Exclusions to follow consistent, scientifically justified criteria
- Documentation of reasons for each exclusion
- Transparency about changes from initial to final analysis
- Results that don't dramatically change due to these specific exclusions

## Conclusion

While participant exclusion between analysis versions can be legitimate, the context here raises significant concerns. Without misconduct, we would expect exclusions to follow predetermined criteria with transparent documentation. However, combined with modified preregistration and suspicious p-value patterns, these exclusions appear more questionable than they would in isolation.

Legitimate exclusions do occur in honest research, but the pattern described fits more closely with selective data manipulation. Still, without knowing the specific reasons for the exclusions or whether they were scientifically justified, some probability remains that they were legitimate.

I need to consider how likely it would be for a preregistration document to be modified after data collection if Lena did not commit misconduct.

Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent researcher degrees of freedom and p-hacking by documenting analysis plans before seeing the data. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines this purpose and is generally considered improper research practice.

However, there could be non-fraudulent explanations:

1. Genuine mistake: Lena might have been confused about preregistration procedures, especially if this was her first preregistered study.

2. Software transition issues: The lab switched software recently, which could have led to file handling errors or confusion about document versioning.

3. Miscommunication with supervisor: Professor Mills might have suggested changes without explaining proper procedures.

4. Technical problems: The hard drive failure could have corrupted original files, forcing recreation of documents.

Nevertheless, several factors make innocent explanations less plausible:

- Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically (rather than other elements) suggests potential p-hacking to obtain favorable results.
- As a third-year PhD student in neuroscience, Lena likely had sufficient training to understand preregistration principles.
- The timing (after data collection) combined with the strong results and the whistleblower's concerns raises red flags.
- The pressure for publishable findings creates a clear motivation for misconduct.

While innocent explanations are possible, modifying preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious deviation from proper scientific procedure and highly suspicious.

25
To assess this scenario, I need to consider whether an unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 (with very few just above) would naturally occur if no misconduct took place.

In legitimate scientific research, p-values should follow certain distributions:

1. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means we'd expect roughly equal numbers of p-values in each range (e.g., .04-.05, .05-.06, etc.).

2. If there is a genuine effect, p-values tend to be distributed with more values at the lower end, but the distribution would typically be smooth rather than showing sharp discontinuities around arbitrary thresholds like .05.

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 is statistically very improbable without some form of manipulation. This pattern is widely recognized in scientific literature as a red flag for p-hacking - where researchers run multiple analyses or adjust parameters until results cross the significance threshold.

For this pattern to occur naturally:
- It would require an extraordinary coincidence where multiple independent analyses all produced results that happened to fall just below .05
- The sharp drop-off after .05 is particularly unlikely to occur by chance

While not impossible, such distributions are so rare in untampered data that they are often used in meta-scientific research specifically to detect publication bias and p-hacking across fields.

The exploratory nature of these analyses makes this pattern even more suspicious, as exploratory work typically produces more variable results unless selectively reported or manipulated.

10
I need to evaluate whether Lena's email statements would be likely even if she didn't commit misconduct.

The content of these emails reveals significant career pressure and outcome-focused thinking, but this alone doesn't prove misconduct. Let me analyze each component:

1. "Counting on this study to save the grant" - This reflects a common reality in academic science where funding continuity depends on producing positive results. Many honest researchers feel this pressure and might express it candidly to friends. This statement acknowledges the stakes but doesn't necessarily indicate willingness to manipulate data.

2. "A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" - This unfortunately reflects the publication bias in academia. Many researchers accurately perceive that null results are harder to publish and less valued for career advancement. A researcher can recognize this system problem without choosing to compromise their integrity.

3. "I need this one to work" - This is more ambiguous. It could mean "I hope the theory is correct and the data supports it" (compatible with integrity) or it could mean "I need to make this data show significant results regardless" (suggesting potential misconduct).

These statements reveal the problematic incentive structure in academic science that can push researchers toward questionable practices. However, many honest researchers experience these pressures and might vent about them to friends without crossing ethical lines.

Such emails indicate career anxiety and awareness of publication bias, but many researchers who maintain integrity might express similar sentiments while still conducting their research honestly.

65
To assess this scenario, I need to consider whether participant exclusions between an early and final analysis script could have legitimate explanations if no misconduct occurred.

Legitimate reasons for excluding participants after initial analyses include:

1. Standard data cleaning procedures: Researchers often identify outliers, equipment failures, or protocol violations after preliminary analyses. This is normal scientific practice if done according to pre-specified criteria.

2. Participant compliance issues: Some participants may be discovered to have misunderstood instructions or failed attention checks during more thorough data examination.

3. Technical or methodological improvements: As analyses progress, researchers might legitimately refine their approach based on methodological considerations (though ideally this should follow preregistered procedures).

4. Identification of inclusion/exclusion criteria violations: Information that disqualifies certain participants might only become apparent during data processing.

However, several contextual factors complicate this assessment:

- The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria
- There's a whistleblower claim that data "look too perfect"
- The final dataset shows suspicious p-value distributions
- The exclusions occurred between an automated backup and the final version

While participant exclusions can be legitimate, the pattern here raises concerns, particularly since we know the preregistration was modified after data collection specifically to change exclusion criteria.

In an honest research context, some participant exclusion between early and final analyses could occur, but the specific circumstances here (changing preregistration, suspicious p-values) make innocent explanations less likely.

Running claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 — PD (run 16)
I need to evaluate the likelihood that Lena would write these emails even if she didn't commit academic misconduct.

These statements from Lena reflect career pressure and awareness of incentives in academia, which is unfortunately common in research environments:

1. "Supervisor counting on this study to save the grant" - This is a realistic assessment of how academic funding works. PIs often depend on positive results to maintain grant funding, and this pressure cascades to lab members. Lena might simply be acknowledging the stakes.

2. "A null result would kill my chances at a postdoc" - This reflects the publication bias in academia where positive findings are more likely to be published than null results. PhD students genuinely worry about this, as publications are crucial for career advancement.

3. "I need this one to work" - This could express hope for a clean result rather than intent to fabricate one. Researchers often invest significant time in studies and naturally hope their hypotheses are supported.

These statements reveal career anxiety and awareness of publication pressure, but don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Many honest researchers feel these pressures and might express them privately to friends. The statements reflect the problematic incentive structure in academia rather than proving dishonesty.

If Lena were planning misconduct, she might have been more explicit about manipulation in private communications or avoided creating a written record of her concerns altogether.

Without other evidence, these emails mainly show that Lena understood the career implications of her research outcomes, which is common knowledge among academics.

85
I need to evaluate how likely it would be to see an unusually high concentration of p-values just below 0.05 (with almost none just above) if Lena did not commit misconduct.

This pattern of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold is considered a statistical red flag in research. Here's why this pattern is unlikely to occur naturally:

1. In genuine data analysis, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If an effect exists, there should be more low p-values, but the distribution shouldn't sharply change right at 0.05.

2. Finding multiple exploratory analyses with p-values clustered just below 0.05 (0.047, 0.049, 0.041) but almost none just above suggests potential "p-hacking" - where researchers try different analyses until finding ones that yield significant results.

3. This asymmetric clustering around the significance threshold is precisely what we would expect from selective reporting or data manipulation aimed at achieving statistical significance.

There are some alternative explanations that don't involve misconduct:
- Extreme coincidence (statistically very unlikely)
- Publication bias in previous literature leading to biased hypotheses
- Unintentional researcher degrees of freedom without deliberate p-hacking
- Selective reporting of analyses without understanding it constitutes questionable research practices

However, the specific pattern described - multiple exploratory analyses with p-values clustered just below 0.05 and almost none just above - is highly unusual in honest research. This pattern has been extensively documented in meta-scientific research as a key indicator of potential research impropriety.

The probability that such a pattern would emerge naturally without some form of misconduct is quite low.

15
I need to evaluate how likely it is that Lena would modify the preregistration document after data collection if she did not commit academic misconduct.

Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent researchers from making post-hoc changes to their analysis plans after seeing the data. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analysis decisions before knowing the results.

There are a few potential innocent explanations, but they're all quite unlikely:

1. Technical error: Perhaps Lena thought she was updating a different document or wasn't aware that the timestamp would indicate post-data modification. However, researchers who use preregistration should understand its purpose.

2. Clarification without substantive changes: Sometimes researchers might clarify ambiguous wording without changing the actual analysis plan. However, the scenario specifically mentions changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, which are substantive modifications.

3. Honest mistake in timing: Perhaps Lena intended to finalize the preregistration before data collection but missed the deadline and tried to "catch up" without realizing this violates research integrity. However, this would still demonstrate a serious misunderstanding of research ethics.

4. Direction from supervisor: Lena might have been instructed to make these changes by Professor Mills without understanding the ethical implications. However, as a third-year PhD student, she should have sufficient training to recognize this issue.

The modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a direct violation of research integrity principles. It allows researchers to select analyses that yield desired results rather than testing hypotheses fairly. This practice, called "HARKing" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known), is widely recognized as inappropriate research conduct.

Given the nature of preregistration and the specific changes made to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, there are very few plausible innocent explanations.

10
I need to evaluate how likely it is that participants would be legitimately excluded between an earlier and final analysis if Lena did not commit misconduct.

There are several valid reasons why participants might be excluded from a final dataset after appearing in preliminary analyses:

1. Legitimate exclusion criteria application: Researchers often identify participants who don't meet inclusion criteria (e.g., failure to follow instructions, technical issues during testing, outlier performance) during data cleaning. This is standard practice when done transparently.

2. Data quality checks: After initial analysis, researchers might discover issues with certain participants' data (equipment malfunctions, participant inattention) that weren't immediately apparent.

3. Preregistered exclusion rules: If the preregistration included specific exclusion criteria (e.g., performance below a certain threshold, completion time, attention checks), applying these legitimately could result in participant reduction.

4. Error correction: An initial script might have incorrectly included participants who should have been excluded based on the study design.

5. Honest mistakes in data processing: The initial script might have contained errors that were later corrected, leading to appropriate participant exclusions.

The key factors making this potentially legitimate include:
- Whether exclusions followed preregistered criteria
- Whether exclusions were reported transparently in the final paper
- Whether the justifications for exclusions were scientifically sound
- Whether the exclusions were applied consistently across conditions

Without more information about why these participants were excluded or whether these exclusions were disclosed, there's a reasonable possibility this represents normal data cleaning rather than misconduct.

However, this must be considered alongside the other concerning evidence, particularly the modified preregistration document and clustering of p-values.

# Analysis of P-value Distribution Pattern

The pattern described - an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 - is concerning from a statistical perspective.

## Why This Pattern Is Suspicious

1. **Natural p-value distributions** typically show a relatively smooth distribution across values. When examining exploratory analyses, we would expect to see p-values distributed somewhat evenly around the threshold, with some falling just below .05 and others just above.

2. **The "p-value cliff"** (many values just under .05 and very few just over) is a recognized warning sign of potential p-hacking or selective reporting in scientific literature. This pattern suggests researchers may have conducted multiple analyses, selectively reporting only those that reached statistical significance.

3. **In exploratory analyses** especially, finding such a consistent pattern of "just significant" results is mathematically unlikely without some form of selection or manipulation.

## Innocent Explanations?

Some potential innocent explanations could include:

- **Statistical power** that happens to place many true effects in the marginally significant range (though this would be a remarkable coincidence)
- **Analysis decisions** made prior to seeing the data that coincidentally produced many borderline significant results
- **Software changes** introducing systematic biases in calculation (though this would likely affect all p-values, not just those near the threshold)

## Statistical Unlikelihood

The described pattern represents a statistical anomaly that is difficult to explain through chance alone. In legitimate research, we would expect:
- A more uniform distribution of p-values
- Similar numbers of results just below and just above the significance threshold

The pattern described is a well-documented fingerprint of selective reporting or p-hacking in scientific literature. While not impossible to occur naturally, it is highly improbable.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the likelihood of observing this specific pattern would be quite low.

Probability judgment: 15
# Analysis of Participant Exclusion in Earlier vs. Final Scripts

Participant exclusion between versions of analysis scripts can occur for many legitimate reasons in research. Let me analyze how likely this would be if no misconduct occurred.

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Data quality concerns**: Researchers often exclude participants after discovering issues like:
   - Equipment malfunction during specific sessions
   - Participant non-compliance with instructions
   - Outlier responses that suggest misunderstanding of tasks
   - Technical errors in data recording

2. **Refined inclusion/exclusion criteria**: During analysis, researchers may realize certain criteria need adjustment:
   - Participants who don't meet attention checks
   - Participants with excessive missing data
   - Participants with response patterns suggesting inattention
   - Participants who fall outside demographic parameters relevant to the study

3. **Methodological improvements**: Legitimate exclusions often happen as analysis plans mature:
   - Applying more rigorous data quality thresholds
   - Implementing pre-registered exclusion criteria that weren't initially coded
   - Addressing reviewer suggestions about participant eligibility
   - Correcting initial coding errors that incorrectly included ineligible participants

4. **Standard research practice**: In cognitive neuroscience specifically, it's very common to:
   - Begin with all collected data
   - Apply exclusion criteria as analysis progresses
   - Document exclusion decisions in methods sections

## Assessment in This Context

In cognitive neuroscience research specifically:
- Participant exclusion between analysis versions is extremely common
- Data cleaning often reveals participants who need to be excluded
- Multiple versions of analysis scripts with different participant counts would be expected in most studies

The existence of an earlier script with more participants is completely consistent with normal, ethical research practices, provided that:
- Exclusion criteria were applied consistently
- Exclusion decisions were based on objective criteria
- Exclusions were properly documented and justified

Such participant exclusions represent standard practice in the field and would be highly likely to occur in the absence of misconduct.

Probability judgment: 85
# Analysis of Lena's Email Statements Without Misconduct

The emails Lena sent to her friend express significant career pressure and concern about study outcomes. I'll analyze how likely these statements would be from a researcher who isn't committing misconduct.

## Context of Academic Pressure in PhD Programs

1. **Real career pressures**: Graduate students commonly experience and discuss:
   - The importance of publications for academic advancement
   - Anxiety about postdoctoral prospects
   - Awareness that advisors need successful studies for grant renewal
   - The professional consequences of null results

2. **Normal emotional expression**: These emails represent:
   - Private venting to a trusted friend
   - Acknowledgment of the high-stakes nature of academic research
   - Genuine career anxiety that most PhD students experience
   - Emotional investment in research outcomes

3. **Common sentiments in academia**: Phrases like "need this one to work" often reflect:
   - Hope that the research hypothesis is correct
   - Desire for career validation and advancement
   - Awareness of publication bias against null results
   - Concern about wasted time and resources if findings aren't publishable

4. **Difference between feeling pressure and acting unethically**:
   - Experiencing pressure is nearly universal in academia
   - Most researchers feel this pressure without resorting to misconduct
   - Expressing career concerns doesn't equate to willingness to falsify data
   - The statements describe the reality of academic incentives, not intentions to manipulate

## Analysis of Specific Statements

"Counting on this study to save the grant" - This accurately describes how grant funding works in academia. Principal investigators often need promising results to secure continued funding.

"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" - This reflects the real publication bias in academia, where null results are harder to publish and less valued in hiring.

"I need this one to work" - This can simply express hope that the hypothesis is correct and the experiment succeeds, not necessarily intent to manipulate outcomes.

These statements reflect the genuine pressures of academic research and would be quite natural coming from an honest researcher experiencing normal career anxiety.

Probability judgment: 80
# Analysis of Post-Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection has begun, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, fundamentally contradicts the purpose of preregistration. Let me analyze how likely this would be without misconduct.

## Purpose of Preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to:
- Document hypotheses and analysis plans before seeing the data
- Prevent post-hoc changes to analysis strategies based on results
- Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- Reduce researcher degrees of freedom that can lead to false positives

## Legitimate Scenarios (Limited)

1. **Administrative corrections** might include:
   - Fixing typos or grammatical errors
   - Clarifying ambiguous wording without changing substance
   - Adding missing details that don't alter analysis plans

2. **Transparent amendments** might include:
   - Clearly labeled, justified modifications with timestamps
   - Changes made through formal amendment processes
   - Modifications that don't invalidate original plans but add to them

However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines the core purpose of preregistration and is generally considered inappropriate in research methodology.

## Assessment in This Context

Several factors make this concerning:
- Changes to exclusion criteria could directly impact which participants' data is analyzed
- Modifications to primary outcomes could shift what's considered the main finding
- Both changes fundamentally alter the confirmatory nature of the analyses
- These specific modifications are central to research integrity, not peripheral details

Even without intentional misconduct, this represents a significant departure from proper research practices. At minimum, it demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of preregistration principles or careless approach to research methods.

While technically possible that someone might make these changes without fraudulent intent (perhaps due to methodological naivety or poor research training), the modification of exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection strongly contradicts established research standards.

# Analysis of the P-value Distribution

When examining the described pattern of p-values clustering just below .05 with almost none just above, I need to consider both innocent explanations and what this pattern typically indicates.

## Statistical Context
In genuine research with no selective reporting or p-hacking:
- P-values should follow a uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true)
- Or they should be skewed toward smaller values (if there are true effects)
- There should be no discontinuity or unusual clustering around the significance threshold of .05

## The Described Pattern
The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no values just above is a well-documented marker of potential p-hacking. This pattern typically emerges when researchers:
- Run multiple analyses until finding significant results
- Selectively report only significant findings
- Adjust analysis parameters to push borderline results below the threshold

## Innocent Explanations?
Possible non-misconduct explanations include:
1. Random chance - but this is extremely unlikely to produce this specific pattern
2. Some form of publication bias in what analyses were pursued deeply
3. Undisclosed multiple testing with no intentional deception
4. Honest errors in analysis procedures that coincidentally produced this pattern

## Scientific Literature on This Pattern
Research on p-value distributions (by Simonsohn, Nelson & Simmons; Head et al.; and others) has shown that this specific pattern - clustering just below .05 with a dropoff just above - is one of the strongest indicators of selective reporting or data manipulation in scientific literature.

Given the specific nature of this pattern, the multiple analyses showing the same pattern, and the extensive research showing this is a hallmark of p-hacking, the probability that this pattern would emerge without some form of selective reporting or data manipulation is very low.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this pattern by chance is approximately 5.
# Analysis of the Unusual p-value Distribution

This pattern of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold of .05 with almost none just above is a classic sign that warrants careful scrutiny. Let me analyze how likely this pattern would be without misconduct:

## Legitimate Explanations

1. **Publication Bias Effects**: Researchers might conduct multiple analyses and focus on reporting those that reach significance. This is problematic but different from fabrication.

2. **Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: Lena might have tried multiple legitimate analytical approaches (different exclusion criteria, covariates, etc.) until finding ones that produced significant results.

3. **P-hacking Without Awareness**: Lena might have engaged in questionable research practices without recognizing their problematic nature - stopping data collection when results looked favorable or exploring numerous variables.

4. **Software Change Issues**: The lab switched software, which could potentially affect calculation methods and results.

## Statistical Considerations

In genuinely random sampling from null hypotheses:
- p-values should be uniformly distributed
- There should be roughly equal numbers of p-values just below and just above .05
- A clustering just below .05 with a "gap" above .05 is statistically unlikely

This pattern is often called the "p-curve cliff" and is considered a red flag in many statistical audits.

## Assessment

The probability of seeing this pattern naturally is extremely low. While researcher degrees of freedom and publication bias can create some distortion, the complete absence of p-values just above .05 with many just below is rarely observed in datasets without some form of problematic intervention.

This doesn't definitively prove misconduct - Lena might have engaged in questionable research practices without realizing their impropriety, or there could be some complex interaction with the software change - but the pattern itself is highly suspicious and difficult to explain through chance alone.

15
# Analyzing Participant Exclusions in Non-Misconduct Scenario

Participant exclusion between earlier and final analysis scripts can be entirely legitimate and is quite common in research. Let me examine the likelihood of this occurring without misconduct:

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Standard Data Cleaning**: Researchers routinely identify and exclude participants who:
   - Failed attention checks or manipulation checks
   - Showed extreme response patterns (e.g., straight-lining)
   - Had excessive missing data
   - Were statistical outliers based on pre-defined criteria

2. **Protocol Violations**: Participants might be excluded if they:
   - Did not follow task instructions properly
   - Had technical issues during the experiment
   - Were found to meet exclusion criteria that wasn't initially caught

3. **Reviewer Feedback**: After journal review, reviewers might suggest:
   - More stringent exclusion criteria
   - Different handling of outliers
   - Additional quality control measures

4. **Methodological Refinement**: As analysis progresses, researchers often develop more sophisticated criteria for:
   - Identifying poor-quality data
   - Handling specific experimental artifacts
   - Applying more appropriate exclusion thresholds

## Normal Research Workflow

In cognitive neuroscience particularly, it's standard practice to:
- Start with all collected data
- Apply increasingly refined exclusion criteria
- Document changes in analysis approach
- Finalize the dataset based on methodologically sound criteria

The evolution from an earlier script with more participants to a final dataset with exclusions represents normal analytical progression and quality control in research.

## Assessment

Without additional information suggesting problematic patterns in who was excluded, having participants in early analyses that don't appear in the final dataset is extremely common in legitimate research. Nearly all published studies go through some form of data cleaning and participant exclusion between initial and final analyses.

75
# Analysis of Lena's Emails in a Non-Misconduct Scenario

These email statements reflect significant career pressure and anxiety about research outcomes rather than necessarily indicating misconduct. Let me analyze how likely these statements would be without misconduct:

## Academic Pressures in PhD Research

1. **Grant Pressure Reality**: It's extremely common for:
   - Labs to depend on positive results for grant renewals
   - PIs to communicate this pressure to their students
   - Students to feel responsible for producing "successful" research

2. **Career Concerns**: PhD students are acutely aware that:
   - Publication record affects postdoc opportunities
   - Null results are harder to publish in high-impact journals
   - Career advancement often depends on "productive" research

3. **Emotional Investment**: Researchers typically:
   - Invest years in their projects
   - Feel personally connected to research outcomes
   - Experience anxiety about project success

## Contextualizing the Specific Statements

"Counting on this study to save the grant": This reflects a common reality in academic funding cycles where continued funding depends on demonstrating progress.

"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc": This shows awareness of publication bias and the academic job market's emphasis on positive findings.

"I need this one to work": This expresses hope and anxiety rather than necessarily intention to manipulate. "Work" could mean producing clean data, running smoothly, or yielding interpretable results.

## Assessment

These statements primarily reveal the psychological pressure and career anxiety that are unfortunately endemic in academic research. They demonstrate awareness of the incentive structures in academia rather than intent to fabricate results. Many honest researchers have expressed similar sentiments while maintaining research integrity.

Such emails reflect the problematic "publish or perish" culture in science and the psychological burden it places on early-career researchers, but they don't necessarily indicate misconduct. Lena could feel all these pressures while still conducting her research with integrity.

70
# Analysis of Post-Data Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes represents a serious deviation from proper research practices. Let me analyze how likely this would be without intentional misconduct:

## Legitimate Explanations (Though Problematic)

1. **Misunderstanding of Preregistration Purpose**:
   - Early-career researchers sometimes misunderstand preregistration as a living document
   - Lena might not realize modifications after data collection undermine the purpose of preregistration
   - She might view it as "cleaning up" documentation rather than as problematic

2. **Poor Research Practices Without Fraudulent Intent**:
   - Questionable research practices exist on a spectrum distinct from deliberate fraud
   - Researchers sometimes rationalize post-hoc changes as "clarifications" or "corrections"
   - These represent significant methodological errors but not necessarily fabrication/falsification

3. **Technical or Administrative Errors**:
   - The file might have been opened and automatically saved without intentional changes
   - Documentation updates might have been made to match verbal decisions made earlier
   - Changes might reflect corrections of earlier errors or omissions

## Assessment of Severity

Modifying preregistration after data collection specifically to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a fundamental violation of preregistration principles. It effectively nullifies the main benefits of preregistration:
- Preventing hypothesizing after results are known
- Distinguishing confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- Reducing researcher degrees of freedom

This practice, while potentially done without fraudulent intent, represents a serious breach of research methodology that significantly increases the risk of false positives and undermines the credibility of the findings.

## Probability Assessment

Such modifications are very difficult to justify and unlikely to occur without at least some awareness that proper procedure is being violated. While this could potentially result from severe ignorance about research methods rather than deliberate fraud, the changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (rather than minor administrative details) make innocent explanations less plausible.

I'll analyze how likely it is that Lena would write such emails if she didn't commit misconduct.

The content of Lena's emails reflects pressures that are unfortunately common in academic research:

1. Grant pressure: Academic labs often depend on grant funding to survive. It's realistic that a supervisor would place importance on positive results for grant renewal. This pressure is a documented issue in academia.

2. Career concerns: The "publish or perish" dynamic in academia is well-established. PhD students genuinely worry about needing publications for postdoc positions. Null results are harder to publish in high-impact journals, potentially limiting career opportunities.

3. "Need this to work" language: This phrasing is ambiguous. While it could suggest willingness to manipulate data, it could also express hope for genuine positive findings or anxiety about the study's outcome. Many researchers privately express such sentiments without crossing ethical lines.

These statements reflect real pressures in academic science that researchers frequently discuss. A PhD student might naturally express these concerns to a friend while still conducting honest research. The emails show awareness of career incentives but don't necessarily indicate misconduct.

Even researchers with complete integrity feel and discuss these pressures. The emails reveal the problematic incentive structure in academia rather than proving misconduct. Many honest researchers have expressed similar sentiments while maintaining research integrity.

Probability: 80
I'll analyze how likely this p-value distribution would be without misconduct.

The pattern described—many p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05—is statistically concerning for several reasons:

1. Natural distribution: In genuine research without selective reporting or p-hacking, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If there are true effects, we'd expect a right-skewed distribution with more low p-values, but the transition would be gradual without sharp discontinuities at .05.

2. The "cliff" at .05: The described pattern shows a suspicious discontinuity exactly at the conventional significance threshold of .05. This "cliff" pattern, where values just below .05 are common but values just above .05 are rare, is widely recognized in meta-scientific research as a red flag for selective reporting or data manipulation.

3. Multiple exploratory analyses: Having this pattern across several exploratory analyses compounds the statistical unlikelihood. Exploratory analyses in particular should show a more random distribution of p-values.

4. Mathematical probability: The chance of multiple independent tests naturally producing this clustered pattern just below the significance threshold is extremely low. The exact probability depends on the specific number of tests and their distribution, but generally, this pattern is highly improbable through chance alone.

Statisticians and meta-scientists have extensively documented that this specific pattern is a strong indicator of data manipulation, selective reporting, or p-hacking. While not impossible in honest research, it is exceedingly unlikely without some form of data manipulation.

Probability: 10
I'll analyze how likely it would be for Lena to modify the preregistration document after data collection without committing misconduct.

Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent researchers from making post-hoc changes to analyses based on results. The core purpose is to distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses by documenting analysis plans before seeing the data. Changing preregistered exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines this purpose.

Key considerations:

1. Definitional issue: Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is, by most definitions in scientific ethics, a form of misconduct itself. The very purpose of preregistration is to prevent such post-hoc changes.

2. Legitimate scenarios: There are extremely limited circumstances where modifications might be justified:
   - Correcting genuine clerical errors in the original document
   - Responding to unforeseen technical issues that make the original plan impossible
   - Documenting deviations transparently as exploratory rather than confirmatory

3. Proper procedure: Even in these rare cases, ethical practice requires:
   - Maintaining the original preregistration
   - Documenting changes transparently
   - Acknowledging the exploratory nature of modified analyses
   - Not claiming preregistered status for the modified analyses

4. Timestamp evidence: The file timestamps provide objective evidence that changes were made after data collection, eliminating the possibility this was proper preregistration.

For this not to constitute misconduct, Lena would need to have:
- Made the changes for legitimate reasons
- Documented them transparently
- Not presented post-hoc analyses as preregistered
- Reported results from the original plan alongside any modifications

Given that the scenario describes changing "exclusion criteria and primary outcomes" specifically (the elements most likely to affect statistical significance), without mentioning any transparent documentation, the likelihood this was done without misconduct is extremely low.

Probability: 5
I'll analyze how likely it would be for Lena to exclude participants between analysis versions if she didn't commit misconduct.

There are legitimate reasons why participants might be excluded between an earlier analysis and the final dataset:

1. Standard exclusion criteria: Researchers routinely exclude participants for valid methodological reasons:
   - Failure to follow instructions or complete the experiment
   - Technical issues during data collection
   - Performance indicating lack of attention (e.g., accuracy below chance)
   - Clear outliers identified by standard statistical methods
   - Participants who don't meet inclusion criteria that were missed initially

2. Data cleaning processes: Initial analyses often include all participants before proper screening is applied. The normal workflow involves:
   - Running preliminary analyses on all data
   - Applying predetermined exclusion criteria
   - Removing invalid data points based on objective standards
   - Documenting exclusions transparently

3. Appropriate timing: Finding issues with participants during data analysis is common in research. What matters is whether:
   - The exclusions followed preregistered criteria
   - The process was documented transparently
   - The decisions weren't influenced by how they affected the hypothesis

4. Technical explanations: The scenario mentions software changes and a hard drive failure, which could explain why exclusions might appear between versions if data needed to be reprocessed or criteria reapplied.

Without knowing the specific reasons for the exclusions, we can't determine if they were appropriate. If the exclusions followed predetermined criteria and weren't selectively applied to achieve significance, this pattern would be consistent with normal research practices.

However, considering the other concerning elements in this case (modified preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution), the exclusions become more questionable, though still possibly legitimate if properly justified and documented.

# Analysis of Post-Data Collection Preregistration Modifications

In evaluating the likelihood of an innocent explanation for modifying a preregistration document after data collection, I need to consider legitimate reasons this might occur versus typical patterns of misconduct.

## Innocent Explanations Possible

1. **Administrative Updates**: Researchers sometimes update preregistration documents to clarify ambiguities or fix obvious errors, though this should typically be done transparently.

2. **Protocol Deviations Documentation**: Legitimate modifications can occur to document necessary deviations that occurred during the study, though these should be clearly marked as post-hoc changes.

3. **Software Transition Issues**: The mentioned lab software switch could have created confusion about document versioning.

4. **Inexperience with Preregistration Practices**: As a third-year PhD student, Lena might not fully understand proper preregistration procedures.

## Concerning Factors

1. **Changing Exclusion Criteria**: Modifying exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a serious red flag, as this can allow researchers to selectively include/exclude participants to achieve desired results.

2. **Changing Primary Outcomes**: Similarly concerning, as this allows researchers to focus on measures that showed significance while downplaying those that didn't.

3. **Timing**: The modifications occurring after data collection but before publication suggests potential p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).

4. **Context**: The high-pressure environment with a supervisor needing publishable results increases risk factors.

## Assessment

In proper research practice, preregistration should remain unmodified after data collection begins. If changes are needed, transparent documentation of deviations should be provided separately rather than modifying the original document. 

The modifications described specifically target exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - precisely the elements that could most effectively be manipulated to achieve statistical significance. This pattern is highly consistent with questionable research practices.

While innocent explanations exist, the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) combined with the pressure for results makes an innocent explanation quite unlikely.

# Analysis of p-value Distribution in Absence of Misconduct

I need to assess how likely it is for a dataset to naturally show a clustering of p-values just below .05 with very few just above .05, assuming no misconduct occurred.

## Expected p-value Distribution in Legitimate Research

1. **Theoretical Distribution**: In genuine research, p-values should follow a uniform distribution if the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution (with more small values) if there are true effects.

2. **Natural Variability**: Even with true effects, p-values should transition smoothly across the .05 threshold. There's no natural statistical mechanism that would cause values to cluster just below .05 while being rare just above it.

3. **Multiple Testing**: Even with multiple analyses, the distribution should not show a sharp discontinuity precisely at p = .05.

## Evaluating Specific Patterns Described

1. **Clustering Below .05**: The specific values mentioned (.047, .049, .041) all fall very close to but below the conventional significance threshold. This pattern is extremely difficult to explain through natural statistical processes.

2. **Gap Above .05**: The near absence of p-values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .053) creates a discontinuity that has no legitimate statistical explanation.

3. **Exploratory Analyses**: This pattern appearing specifically in exploratory analyses is particularly telling, as these analyses typically have fewer methodological constraints.

## Relevant Research

Meta-research on p-value distributions has documented that this exact pattern - a cluster just below .05 with a drop just above - is a telltale sign of p-hacking. Studies by Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014) and Head et al. (2015) demonstrate that this discontinuity at .05 is virtually impossible to generate through legitimate statistical procedures.

## Assessment

The pattern described is precisely what would be expected from p-hacking practices such as:
- Analyzing data multiple ways until finding significance
- Selectively reporting only analyses that "worked"
- Continuing to collect data until reaching significance

In the absence of misconduct, this distinctive discontinuity in p-value distribution around .05 is statistically implausible
# Analysis of Unusual P-value Distribution Without Misconduct

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described p-value distribution pattern is highly unusual and difficult to explain through legitimate means. Let me analyze the likelihood:

## Statistical Expectations for P-values

1. **Natural Distribution**: Under null hypothesis conditions, p-values should follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, meaning we should see roughly equal numbers of p-values in any equal-sized range (e.g., as many between .045-.050 as between .050-.055).

2. **Under True Effects**: Even when genuine effects exist, the distribution typically shows a right-skewed pattern with more very small p-values, but still maintains a relatively smooth transition across the significance threshold.

## Possible Innocent Explanations

1. **Random Chance**: By chance alone, a small sample of p-values might cluster below .05, but this becomes increasingly improbable as the number of analyses increases.

2. **Underpowered Study**: Studies with low statistical power might produce more marginally significant results, but these should still appear on both sides of the threshold.

3. **Publication Bias in Citation**: If Lena's analyses were influenced by published literature (which itself suffers from publication bias), she might have designed analyses that replicate previously published (significant) findings.

4. **Fortuitous Methodological Choices**: In theory, Lena might have coincidentally selected analytical approaches that happen to yield many nearly-significant results.

## Assessment Factors

1. **Exploratory Analyses**: The pattern appears in "exploratory analyses" which typically have even less structure and constraint than primary analyses, making a natural clustering less likely.

2. **Discontinuity at .05**: The sharp drop-off with "almost no p-values just above .05" is particularly telling - this discontinuity is very difficult to explain without selective reporting or p-hacking.

3. **Multiple Instances**: The pattern appearing across "several" analyses compounds the statistical improbability.

4. **Concentration Just Below Threshold**: Values clustering just below .05 (rather than being distributed across the significant range) suggests threshold-seeking behavior.

This p-value distribution, often called a "p-curve," is
# Analysis of P-Value Distribution Under Innocence

Let me examine the likelihood of observing a clustering of p-values just below the .05 threshold (with very few just above it) if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.

## Statistical Expectations for P-Value Distributions

1. **Natural Distribution**: Under the null hypothesis, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Even when true effects exist, the distribution typically doesn't show sharp discontinuities around arbitrary thresholds like .05.

2. **Expected Pattern**: Across multiple analyses, we would expect to see a relatively smooth distribution of p-values, with approximately equal numbers of values falling just below and just above any arbitrary threshold.

3. **Multiple Comparisons**: Even with legitimate exploratory analyses, we might see more significant than non-significant results if researchers focus reporting on promising directions, but this wouldn't create a sharp discontinuity precisely at .05.

## Scientific Implausibility of This Pattern

1. **Statistical Anomaly**: The described pattern of multiple p-values clustering between .041-.049 with almost none between .051-.059 is mathematically improbable without some form of selection or manipulation.

2. **No Natural Mechanism**: There is no innocent statistical process that would cause p-values to "avoid" the region just above .05 while concentrating just below it.

3. **Inconsistency with Random Chance**: True exploratory analyses should produce a mix of significant and non-significant results with no sharp cutoff at the significance threshold.

## Considering Innocent Explanations

1. **Selective Reporting**: While researchers might innocently focus on reporting significant findings, this would typically result in omitting high p-values entirely, not a clustering just below .05.

2. **Analysis Choices**: Different statistical approaches might legitimately yield different p-values, but wouldn't systematically produce values just below the threshold.

3. **Random Chance**: By pure coincidence, a small number of analyses might cluster below .05, but the probability of this pattern emerging across "several exploratory analyses" is extremely low.

The described p-value pattern is a widely recognized signature of p-hacking - the practice of trying multiple analyses until achieving statistical significance. This distribution is so diagnostic of
# Analyzing the Unusual Distribution of P-values

The distribution of p-values described - with an unusually high concentration just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) and almost no p-values just above .05 - represents a statistical anomaly that needs careful assessment.

## Expected P-value Distribution in Legitimate Research

1. **Uniform Distribution**: Under the null hypothesis, p-values should follow a uniform distribution - meaning we should see roughly equal numbers of values across the range (0 to 1).

2. **Right-Skewed Distribution**: When true effects exist, the distribution typically becomes right-skewed, with more low p-values than high ones.

3. **No Discontinuity at .05**: Critically, there should be no sharp discontinuity or "cliff" at the arbitrary .05 threshold in either scenario.

## Assessing the Observed Distribution

1. **Statistical Implausibility**: The described pattern - many values just below .05 with few just above - creates a "cliff" or discontinuity that is statistically highly implausible through natural processes.

2. **Meta-analytical Evidence**: Multiple large-scale analyses of published literature have identified this exact pattern as a strong indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting.

3. **Significance Seeking**: This pattern typically emerges when researchers continue analyzing data (adding participants, trying different analyses, removing outliers) until reaching significance.

4. **Exploratory Analyses**: The fact that these suspicious p-values appear in "exploratory analyses" is particularly concerning, as these analyses have more researcher degrees of freedom.

## Innocent Explanations?

1. **Extreme Statistical Fluke**: While theoretically possible, the probability of this pattern emerging naturally is extremely low.

2. **Publication Bias**: Even if Lena didn't manipulate analyses, she might have selectively reported only analyses that reached significance - still a questionable research practice.

3. **Software Issues**: There's no known analytical software problem that would create this specific distribution pattern.

## Assessment

The described p-value distribution represents one of the strongest statistical red flags for data manipulation in research. It is widely recognized in the field of meta-science as a telltale sign of p-hacking.
# Analysis of P-value Distribution Pattern

The described pattern – an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 – is a well-documented statistical anomaly that demands careful consideration.

## Expected Distribution in Legitimate Research

1. **Statistical Theory**: In genuine research without p-hacking, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If alternative hypotheses are true, the distribution should be skewed toward lower values, but should not show sharp discontinuities around arbitrary thresholds like .05.

2. **Around the Significance Threshold**: We would expect to see approximately equal numbers of p-values just below and just above the common .05 threshold (e.g., similar counts in the .04-.05 and .05-.06 ranges).

## Evaluating This Specific Pattern

1. **Clustering Below .05**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with an absence of values just above is a classic signature that has been empirically linked to questionable research practices in multiple meta-scientific studies.

2. **Discontinuity at .05**: This specific pattern (many values just below, few just above) is statistically highly improbable under legitimate analysis conditions.

3. **"Exploratory Analyses"**: The pattern appearing specifically in exploratory analyses raises additional concern, as these analyses typically have fewer constraints and more researcher degrees of freedom.

## Probability in Absence of Misconduct

Various statistical analyses of p-value distributions in the literature have established that this specific pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally. Simulations and theoretical models suggest that such discontinuities at precisely .05 (rather than at other arbitrary values) indicate selective reporting or analysis manipulation.

While random chance could theoretically produce such a pattern, the probability of multiple exploratory analyses all showing this same pattern is vanishingly small without some form of selection or manipulation – intentional or unintentional.

This pattern could theoretically result from completely unconscious biases in analysis choices, but even unintentional p-hacking would still constitute questionable research practices, even if not rising to
# Analysis of P-value Distribution in Absence of Misconduct

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described p-value distribution pattern would be highly unusual from a statistical perspective. Let me explain why:

## Expected P-value Distribution Under Proper Research

1. **Uniform Distribution**: In exploratory analyses where the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be approximately uniformly distributed across the range from 0 to 1. This means we should see roughly equal numbers of p-values in comparable intervals (e.g., .040-.045, .045-.050, .050-.055, etc.)

2. **Continuous Spectrum**: There is no statistical reason why values would cluster just below a threshold like .05 while being absent just above it. Natural variation should produce a smooth distribution across the threshold.

3. **Expected Randomness**: Even with true effects, there should be a mix of significant and non-significant findings in exploratory analyses, not a concentration at any particular threshold.

## Evaluating Innocent Explanations

1. **Publication Bias**: While researchers may focus on reporting significant findings, this alone doesn't explain the clustering just below .05 in the raw dataset itself.

2. **Statistical Flukes**: While random chance can produce unusual patterns, the specific pattern of values clustering just below .05 is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.

3. **Multiple Testing Without Correction**: Even legitimate multiple analyses would produce some p-values above .05, not an absence of them.

4. **Selective Reporting**: This could explain emphasis on significant findings in a paper, but not the absence of barely-nonsignificant values in the dataset itself.

## Assessment

This pattern of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold of .05 with almost none just above is one of the strongest statistical red flags for p-hacking in research. The pattern is so distinctive and contrary to statistical principles that it's considered a hallmark of data manipulation in meta-scientific research.

While extremely improbable events can occur by chance, this specific pattern aligns precisely with what would be expected from selective analysis, data exclusion, or other questionable research practices rather than honest exploratory analysis.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of seeing this unusual p-value distribution is extremely low
# Analysis of P-value Distribution in Absence of Misconduct

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 would be highly unlikely. Here's why:

## Expected P-value Distribution

1. **Natural Distribution**: In genuine exploratory analyses, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) or a right-skewed distribution (if there are true effects). Neither would create a sharp discontinuity at precisely p = .05.

2. **Both Sides of Threshold**: We would expect to see p-values falling on both sides of the .05 threshold in roughly equal proportions in the immediate vicinity of .05 (e.g., as many values between .05 and .06 as between .04 and .05).

3. **Statistical Probability**: The probability of multiple exploratory analyses naturally producing several p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is mathematically improbable without some form of selection or manipulation.

## Relevant Scientific Literature

1. **Publication Bias Research**: Multiple meta-scientific studies have identified this exact pattern (clustering just below .05 with few values just above) as a strong indicator of p-hacking or publication bias.

2. **Statistical Anomaly**: This pattern has been described as the "p-curve" or "p-hacking signature" in methodological literature, and is widely considered evidence of questionable research practices.

## Innocent Explanations Assessment

1. **Software Errors**: While software errors could theoretically produce anomalous results, they would be unlikely to systematically favor p-values just below .05.

2. **Random Chance**: The probability of this pattern occurring by chance across multiple analyses is extremely low.

3. **Analysis Decisions**: Even legitimate analysis decisions (without seeing the data) would not produce this distinctive clustering pattern.

## Conclusion

This distribution pattern is widely recognized in the scientific community as a strong indicator of selection bias or p-hacking. While not impossible to occur naturally, the specific pattern of multiple p-values clustered just below .05 with an absence of values just above .05
# Analysis of Clustering of P-values Just Below .05

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described pattern of p-values would be highly unusual from a statistical perspective. Let me analyze why:

## Statistical Distribution of P-values

1. **Expected Distribution**: Under the null hypothesis (when there is no true effect), p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Even when true effects exist, p-values should not cluster just below arbitrary thresholds.

2. **Natural Distribution Around Threshold**: We would expect to see approximately equal numbers of p-values just below and just above the conventional significance threshold of .05 (e.g., as many values around .051-.059 as around .041-.049).

3. **Multiple Analyses**: With exploratory analyses especially, some results should naturally fall on both sides of the threshold if analyses were conducted without manipulation.

## Issues With the Observed Pattern

1. **Clustering Anomaly**: A concentration of p-values just below .05 (.047, .049, .041) with almost none just above represents a statistically suspicious pattern that has been identified in meta-scientific research as a red flag.

2. **Particularly Problematic for Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses inherently involve multiple tests without predetermined hypotheses, making this clustering even more statistically anomalous.

3. **Discontinuity at Threshold**: Research examining publication patterns shows that this specific discontinuity (many values just below .05, few just above) is indicative of either publication bias or p-hacking.

## Innocent Explanations?

1. **Extreme Statistical Luck**: While technically possible to get this pattern by chance, the probability is vanishingly small.

2. **Selective Reporting**: Even without data manipulation, selective reporting of only significant results could produce this pattern, but this would still constitute questionable research practices.

3. **Software Issues**: The lab's software transition is unlikely to explain this specific statistical anomaly.

## Assessment

The described clustering pattern represents one of the strongest statistical signatures of potential p-hacking in the scientific literature. It is widely recognized in meta-science as a strong indicator that analyses may have been manipulated to reach significance.

Without misconduct, the probability of observing
# Analysis of Unusual P-value Distribution Without Misconduct

The described pattern of p-values clustering just below the conventional significance threshold of .05 (with almost none just above it) is a classic statistical anomaly that requires careful evaluation.

## Evaluating Innocent Explanations

1. **Random Chance**: In genuine research, p-values should distribute relatively uniformly when the null hypothesis is true, or follow a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects. A clustering just below .05 with a notable absence just above is statistically improbable through chance alone.

2. **True Effects at the Boundary**: It's theoretically possible that the true effect sizes in this memory study happen to generate p-values that cluster in this range, but this would be an extraordinary coincidence across multiple exploratory analyses.

3. **Undocumented Multiple Comparisons**: In exploratory analyses, researchers often run many tests. Without proper correction, this increases the likelihood of finding significant results, but would not explain the absence of p-values just above .05.

4. **Publication Bias**: While the scientific literature broadly shows this pattern due to publication bias, this doesn't explain why it would appear in a single researcher's exploratory analyses within one study.

## Statistical Perspective

Statisticians have thoroughly studied p-value distributions, and the pattern described (clustering just below .05 with a "gap" just above) is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of p-hacking or selective reporting. This pattern specifically suggests that analyses producing p-values just above .05 were either modified or not reported.

## Assessment

The described distribution is highly inconsistent with natural statistical patterns. In genuine research without selective reporting or p-hacking, we would expect to see a more continuous distribution of p-values around the threshold, not a sharp discontinuity at precisely .05.

Even accounting for the exploratory nature of the analyses, which might involve multiple tests, we would still expect to see some p-values falling just above the significance threshold if all analyses were faithfully reported.

Given the specificity of this statistical anomaly and its well-documented association with questionable research practices, the likelihood of observing this pattern without any form of selective reporting or analysis manipulation is extremely low.

# Analysis of Lena's Email Comments Without Misconduct

These email statements need to be evaluated in the context of typical academic pressures and how researchers might express them without crossing ethical lines.

## Common Academic Pressures

1. **Grant Dependency Reality**: It's completely normal for lab funding to depend on producing positive results. Labs often do "count on" certain studies to secure continued funding.

2. **Career Advancement Concerns**: Early-career researchers genuinely face career obstacles when their projects don't yield significant findings. Publications remain the primary currency for postdoc positions.

3. **Psychological Investment**: Researchers naturally become invested in their work and hope for meaningful outcomes after months or years of effort.

## Interpreting "I need this one to work"

This phrase is particularly important to analyze:

1. **Ambiguous Meaning**: "Work" could mean:
   - The study needs to run smoothly without technical problems
   - The data collection needs to be completed on schedule
   - The results need to advance scientific understanding
   - The results need to support the hypothesis

2. **Common Sentiment**: Many honest researchers express hope their studies will "work" without implying they'll manipulate results.

## Assessment Context

Even researchers with complete integrity:
- Experience pressure from supervisors about grant funding
- Worry about career implications of null results
- Express hope that studies will yield meaningful outcomes

These statements reflect the unfortunate reality of academic incentive structures rather than necessarily indicating intent to commit fraud. Many researchers feel these pressures and express them privately without resorting to misconduct.

The phrasing does reveal Lena was under significant pressure and had a strong personal stake in the outcome, which creates risk factors for misconduct. However, merely acknowledging these pressures in private emails to a friend is quite common and wouldn't itself be evidence of misconduct.

These comments are consistent with the typical anxieties of a PhD student in a high-pressure academic environment, though they do indicate motivational factors that could potentially lead to misconduct.

# Analysis of Participant Exclusions in Absence of Misconduct

Participant exclusions between analysis versions can occur for legitimate reasons in research. Let me evaluate the likelihood of innocent explanations for this finding.

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusions

1. **Data Quality Issues**: Researchers often identify problems with specific participants' data during analysis that weren't apparent initially:
   - Equipment malfunctions during recording
   - Participant non-compliance with instructions
   - Outlier responses that suggest misunderstanding of tasks
   - Incidental findings that invalidate inclusion (e.g., neurological conditions in a cognitive study)

2. **Refined Exclusion Criteria**: As analysis progresses, researchers might legitimately refine exclusion criteria:
   - Discovering confounding variables requiring additional controls
   - Realizing certain participants didn't meet inclusion criteria that wasn't initially checked
   - Implementing standardized outlier detection procedures

3. **Error Correction**: Early scripts might contain errors in participant selection that are later corrected:
   - Mistakenly including pilot participants
   - Double-counting some participants
   - Including participants who withdrew consent after initial analysis

4. **Protocol Violations**: Detailed review of study notes might reveal protocol violations not initially recorded in the database.

## Contextual Assessment

Several factors make legitimate exclusions plausible in this case:
- Cognitive neuroscience studies often have complex exclusion protocols
- The lab's software transition might have created inconsistencies in data processing
- As a PhD student, Lena might have been refining her analysis approach under supervision

However, there are concerning contextual elements:
- The preregistration document was modified after data collection
- The modifications specifically altered exclusion criteria
- The final results had suspiciously clustered p-values

## Assessment

While participant exclusions are a normal part of the research process, the combination of these exclusions with other concerning factors (modified preregistration, suspicious p-values) creates a more problematic pattern.

If no misconduct occurred, there would need to be well-documented, scientifically valid reasons for each exclusion, consistent with standard practices in cognitive neuroscience. Those reasons would need to be applied consistently and transparently.

Given the mixed context, there are plaus
# Analysis of Participant Exclusions Without Misconduct

Excluding participants between initial and final analyses is a common practice in research and can have legitimate justifications. Let's examine how likely this would be in the absence of misconduct.

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Data Quality Issues**: Researchers often identify problematic data after initial processing (e.g., participants who didn't follow instructions, equipment malfunctions, or contaminated recordings).

2. **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria**: As analysis progresses, researchers might realize certain participants don't meet study requirements (e.g., clinical criteria, performance thresholds) that weren't initially apparent.

3. **Outlier Detection**: Statistical outliers may be identified during preliminary data exploration, leading to justifiable exclusions if they meet pre-established criteria.

4. **Technical Errors**: Initial scripts might include participants who were tested but whose data was corrupted or incomplete, requiring removal.

5. **Protocol Violations**: Further review of study notes might reveal participants who violated experimental protocols.

## Contextual Considerations

Even without misconduct, several contextual factors affect this assessment:

- **Documentation**: Legitimate exclusions should typically be documented with clear justification and consistent criteria.

- **Transparency**: The fact that this earlier version was only found in an automated backup rather than properly archived raises questions.

- **Preregistration Issues**: The modified preregistration document already suggests problems with exclusion criteria transparency.

- **Pressure Environment**: The high-stakes context increases the likelihood that exclusions might be motivated by outcomes.

## Assessment

While participant exclusions between analysis versions are common in research, they normally follow transparent documentation procedures. The combination of modified preregistration and recovered (rather than properly documented) script changes suggests a pattern of problematic documentation.

However, innocent explanations remain plausible - the lab's software transition, Lena's previous record of careful data handling, and the possibility of legitimate exclusions that were poorly documented all provide alternative explanations.

Given these considerations, there's a moderate likelihood that this pattern could occur without intentional misconduct, though the lack of transparency is concerning regardless.

Running claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 — PD (run 21)
I'll analyze how likely it is for participants to be legitimately excluded between an earlier and final analysis if Lena did not commit misconduct.

In cognitive neuroscience research, there are several legitimate reasons why participants might be excluded between early and final analyses:

1. Pre-established exclusion criteria: Participants might be excluded based on criteria set before data collection (e.g., performance thresholds, attention checks, equipment malfunctions).

2. Outlier detection: After initial data processing, statistical outliers might be identified and removed according to standard procedures.

3. Data quality issues: Some participants' data might show excessive noise, artifacts, or technical problems that only become apparent during detailed analysis.

4. Reviewer suggestions: Journal reviewers sometimes recommend additional exclusion criteria or different analytical approaches.

5. Software transition issues: Since the lab recently switched software, there might have been inconsistencies in how exclusion criteria were implemented.

The existence of an earlier version with more participants is actually consistent with normal research practices. Researchers typically run preliminary analyses on all collected data, then apply exclusion criteria to create the final dataset. This process is legitimate as long as:
- Exclusion criteria are justified and documented
- The criteria aren't manipulated specifically to achieve significance
- The exclusions are reported transparently in the final paper

What would be suspicious is if participants were excluded specifically to achieve significant results, if exclusion criteria changed post-hoc without justification, or if the exclusions weren't properly reported in the methods section.

Given that Lena has "a previously strong record of careful data handling," and assuming proper research practices, it's quite likely that legitimate participant exclusions would occur between early and final analyses.

Probability: 80
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of preregistration. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this situation would be highly problematic to explain.

The core purpose of preregistration is to document research plans before data collection to prevent post-hoc adjustments that capitalize on random patterns in the data. Modifying these documents after seeing the data directly undermines this purpose.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, potential explanations might include:

1. Administrative error: Perhaps the modifications were minor corrections to typos or clarifications that didn't substantially alter the research plan.

2. Documentation of deviations: Researchers sometimes update preregistration documents to transparently note necessary deviations from the original plan, but this should be clearly marked as a post-data amendment, not changing the original criteria.

3. Technical misunderstanding: Lena might not have understood that modifying the preregistration document itself (rather than filing an amendment) violates research integrity principles.

4. File timestamp errors: The timestamps might be inaccurate due to file system issues, backup restoration, or other technical problems.

However, these explanations are generally weak because:

- Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data is precisely what preregistration aims to prevent
- Altering primary outcomes after data collection is considered a serious form of p-hacking
- In proper scientific practice, any necessary deviations should be documented separately, not by modifying the original document
- Most researchers at the PhD level should understand these basic principles

Even without intent to deceive, modifying preregistration in this manner represents a serious breach of research methodology. If Lena truly did not commit misconduct (defined as intentional deception), this would imply she fundamentally misunderstood basic research integrity principles or there was a significant technical explanation for the timestamp issues.

Probability: 15
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, these email statements could still be quite likely in the context of academic research pressure. Let me analyze each component:

"My supervisor is counting on this study to save the grant":
This reflects a common reality in academia where grant renewals often depend on producing significant results. Professor Mills being under pressure "to produce publishable findings before a major grant review" is explicitly mentioned in the scenario. Many honest researchers feel and discuss this pressure without compromising their integrity.

"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc":
This statement acknowledges the publication bias in academia where significant results are more likely to be published than null findings. PhD students are acutely aware that their job prospects often depend on publications, especially in high-profile journals. Many honest researchers privately express frustration about this reality while still conducting research properly.

"I need this one to work":
This is perhaps the most ambiguous statement. "Work" could mean:
1. The study needs to yield significant results (potentially concerning)
2. The experiment needs to be executed properly without technical problems
3. The paper needs to be published successfully
4. The research question needs to be addressed conclusively

Even honest researchers often hope their hypotheses are supported, not just for career reasons but because they genuinely believe in their theories. Confirmation bias is a human tendency that researchers struggle with but doesn't automatically indicate misconduct.

These statements express:
- Awareness of career pressures (realistic)
- Anxiety about academic outcomes (common)
- Desire for successful results (natural)

Without additional context indicating how Lena planned to ensure the study "works," these could simply be the private venting of a stressed PhD student facing the realistic pressures of academia. Many honest researchers make similar comments while still maintaining research integrity in their actual work.

Probability: 75
An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 represents one of the most well-documented statistical red flags in research. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern would be highly unlikely to occur naturally.

Here's why this distribution is problematic from a statistical perspective:

1. Natural distribution of p-values: If null hypotheses are being tested honestly, p-values should follow a uniform distribution (or, if true effects exist, a right-skewed distribution with more very low p-values). Either way, there should be roughly equal numbers of p-values just below and just above arbitrary thresholds like .05.

2. The "cliff" at .05: The described pattern shows what researchers call a "p-value cliff" - an abrupt drop in frequency precisely at the significance threshold. This pattern has been extensively studied in meta-research and is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of selective reporting or data manipulation.

3. Multiple exploratory analyses: The fact that this pattern appears across "several exploratory analyses" makes it even less likely to be coincidental. Natural variability might create this pattern by chance in a single test, but seeing it repeatedly across multiple analyses is extremely improbable.

For this pattern to emerge without misconduct, several unlikely scenarios would need to coincide:

- An extraordinary statistical fluke across multiple analyses
- A series of methodological decisions that coincidentally produced this pattern
- Multiple legitimate exclusion criteria that happened to push p-values from just above to just below .05

This pattern has been extensively studied in fields like meta-science, and when observed across multiple analyses, it's considered one of the strongest statistical signatures of p-hacking or selective reporting.

While not impossible to occur naturally, the probability of this pattern emerging without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting is extremely low.

I need to evaluate whether this email language is consistent with an innocent researcher or if it suggests academic misconduct.

The emails express concerns about:
1. Her supervisor counting on the study for grant renewal
2. A null result potentially hurting her postdoc chances
3. Her personal need for the study to succeed

These statements reflect real pressures in academic research that exist regardless of whether a researcher engages in misconduct:

- Publication pressure is a well-documented phenomenon in academia
- Supervisors often do depend on positive results for continued funding
- Career advancement (like securing postdoc positions) is heavily influenced by publication record
- The competitive nature of academia creates genuine stress about research outcomes

A researcher who is completely honest could still feel and express these pressures. The statements don't explicitly suggest an intent to manipulate data - they merely acknowledge the career and funding realities of academic science. The phrase "need this one to work" could simply express hope for a successful study rather than intent to falsify results.

Many honest researchers experience these pressures while maintaining research integrity. The emails reveal career anxiety and awareness of incentive structures, but don't necessarily indicate misconduct. These kinds of statements would be fairly common in private communications between academic friends.

In summary, this email content seems highly consistent with the normal experience of graduate students in competitive research environments, regardless of their ethical conduct.

This question requires evaluating whether participant exclusion between analysis versions is consistent with honest research practices.

In legitimate research, excluding participants between an initial and final analysis is extremely common and often methodologically necessary. There are many valid reasons for this:

1. **Pre-established exclusion criteria being applied**: Participants might be excluded for:
   - Not completing all required tasks
   - Failing attention checks
   - Performing at chance/floor/ceiling levels
   - Technical issues during data collection
   - Violating protocol instructions

2. **Reviewer suggestions**: During peer review, reviewers often request additional analyses with different exclusion criteria.

3. **Iterative data cleaning**: Initial scripts often include all participants before quality control procedures identify problematic cases.

4. **Post-hoc identification of outliers**: Statistical tests might identify outliers that unduly influence results.

5. **Power analyses**: Researchers might determine a smaller sample is sufficient, allowing more efficient analysis.

6. **Software or coding corrections**: Errors in initial scripts might have incorrectly included participants who should have been excluded based on pre-registered criteria.

All these scenarios represent normal, ethical research practices. The scientific process often involves refining analyses as researchers better understand their data. 

What matters is whether:
- Exclusion criteria were principled and documented
- Changes were transparent in the final manuscript
- The exclusions weren't selectively applied to achieve desired results

Without evidence that the exclusions were systematically biased toward a specific outcome, this pattern is highly consistent with normal research practices.

This question addresses whether modifications to a preregistration document after data collection is consistent with honest research practices.

Modifying preregistration documents after data collection, especially changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration. Preregistration exists specifically to commit researchers to their analytical plans before seeing the data, preventing researchers from adjusting analyses to fit their findings.

Legitimate reasons for post-collection modifications are extremely limited:

1. **Clerical corrections**: Fixing typos or clarifying ambiguous language without changing the substantive content might be acceptable but should be transparently documented.

2. **Addressing unforeseen methodological issues**: Occasionally, technical problems might necessitate adjustments, but these should be:
   - Transparently reported in the final paper
   - Clearly marked as deviations from preregistration
   - Accompanied by both preregistered and modified analyses

However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically are among the most problematic modifications possible, as these directly influence the statistical significance of results. These changes represent core analytical decisions that preregistration is explicitly designed to fix before data collection.

Even for honest researchers, this pattern is highly unusual and problematic. At minimum, it represents a serious violation of research best practices and transparency standards. The timing of such changes (after data collection) is especially concerning as it suggests the changes could be influenced by knowledge of the results.

While not impossible for an honest researcher to make such modifications (perhaps due to severe misunderstanding of preregistration principles), this pattern strongly deviates from ethical research practices.

20
This question requires evaluating whether an unusual clustering of p-values just below the significance threshold of .05 (with very few just above) is consistent with honest research practices.

In genuine, unmanipulated research data, p-value distributions have specific expected patterns:

1. **Continuous distribution**: P-values should typically show a relatively smooth distribution, not clustering just below arbitrary thresholds.

2. **Equal density around thresholds**: There's no natural statistical reason why p-values would cluster just below .05 while being absent just above .05.

3. **Random variation**: While some clustering can occur by chance, pronounced asymmetry around the significance threshold is statistically improbable.

The scientific literature has extensively documented that this specific pattern (many values just below .05, few just above) is a strong statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or data manipulation. Several meta-scientific studies have used precisely this pattern to detect problematic research practices across fields.

For legitimate reasons this pattern might appear:

1. **Extreme publication bias**: If only significant results were reported from many analyses (without manipulation), this could create this pattern, but this would still be considered questionable research practices.

2. **Highly unusual random chance**: Though mathematically possible, the probability of this pattern occurring naturally is extremely low.

3. **Specific study designs with multiple decision points**: Some complex designs with sequential analyses might produce clustering, but this would be rare and require explicit methodological justification.

Given the exploratory nature of the analyses showing this pattern, and the combination with other concerning elements (modified preregistration, changing exclusion criteria), the probability that this pattern would emerge without misconduct is very low.

When considering the likelihood of participants being excluded between earlier and final analyses in the absence of misconduct, I need to evaluate normal research practices versus suspicious patterns.

In legitimate research, excluding participants after initial analyses can happen for several valid reasons:

1. Pre-registered exclusion criteria being applied (e.g., participants who failed attention checks, had excessive missing data, or showed evidence of not following instructions)

2. Discovery of technical issues with certain participants' data during quality control

3. Identification of true outliers whose data would inappropriately skew results

4. Refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria based on methodological considerations (though this should be transparently reported)

5. Reviewer feedback suggesting more stringent participant criteria

The key factors that would make this innocent would be:
- Documentation of the exclusion criteria
- Consistency in applying these criteria
- Transparency in reporting the exclusions
- Changes that don't systematically bias toward the desired outcome

What makes this scenario plausible as non-misconduct is the mentioned context about switching software and hard drive failures, which could explain documentation gaps. Additionally, Lena's previously strong record suggests she typically follows proper procedures.

However, the fact that the whistleblower specifically noted that data "looks too perfect" raises concerns about whether the exclusions were made to achieve favorable results rather than for methodologically sound reasons.

Given the information provided, and assuming Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be fairly likely that there would be legitimate participant exclusions between analysis versions, as this is a normal part of the research process when done transparently and with justification.

70
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, these email statements still reflect common sentiments among PhD students in high-pressure academic environments.

The academic system often creates intense pressure to produce positive results, particularly for:
- Grant renewals ("counting on this study to save the grant")
- Career advancement ("kill my chances at a postdoc")
- The general need for publishable results ("I need this one to work")

These statements express awareness of publication bias and career incentives rather than necessarily indicating intent to fabricate results. Many honest researchers feel this pressure while still maintaining scientific integrity. A PhD student might:

1. Express frustration about the system's emphasis on positive results
2. Acknowledge the real career implications of their research outcomes
3. Hope for positive results while still conducting honest research
4. Vent to friends about academic pressures without acting unethically

Such sentiments are remarkably common in academia. Studies on researcher experiences consistently show that early-career scientists feel pressure to produce significant results, worry about career prospects, and understand that null results are harder to publish.

The language ("needs this one to work") expresses hope and anxiety rather than definitively indicating fraudulent intent. Honest researchers often hope experiments "work" in the sense of producing clear, interpretable results or supporting interesting theories, while still accepting whatever outcomes emerge from proper analysis.

Without additional context suggesting misconduct, these emails primarily demonstrate the problematic incentive structures in academia rather than proving dishonesty. Many researchers who maintain integrity still express similar sentiments privately.

75
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be highly problematic and contrary to the purpose of preregistration.

The fundamental purpose of preregistration is to document analysis plans before seeing the data, preventing researchers from making decisions influenced by results. Changing these elements after data collection directly undermines this purpose.

There are very few legitimate reasons why someone not committing misconduct would modify a preregistration after data collection:

1. Correcting genuine clerical errors or typos (though this should be transparently documented)
2. Adding supplementary documentation or clarification without changing the substantive plans
3. Updating the document to note deviations from the original plan (while keeping the original intact)

However, specifically changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is particularly problematic because:

- These are precisely the elements that most impact results
- Such changes create a clear risk of p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)
- They violate the core scientific principle of hypothesis testing

Even without deliberate misconduct, such modifications represent a serious breach of research practices. At minimum, they would constitute questionable research practices (QRPs) that undermine the study's validity.

If Lena were not committing misconduct, she would likely:
- Keep the original preregistration intact
- Document any necessary deviations separately
- Be transparent about timeline issues

The fact that file timestamps show modifications to these critical elements after data collection, without apparent transparency about these changes, makes this very difficult to reconcile with good research practice, even without deliberate fraud.

15
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 would be statistically suspicious and difficult to explain through legitimate means.

In genuine research without p-hacking or selective reporting:

1. P-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects.

2. There should be no discontinuity or unusual clustering around the .05 significance threshold.

3. The number of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .04-.049) should be roughly similar to the number just above .05 (e.g., .051-.06), as statistical noise doesn't respect arbitrary human thresholds.

The pattern described represents what statisticians call the "p-curve cliff" or "p-hacking cliff" - a telltale sign of selective analysis or reporting practices. It suggests that analyses yielding p-values slightly above .05 were either:
- Subjected to additional analytical tweaks until they fell below .05
- Not reported in the final analyses
- Re-analyzed with different parameters

Even without deliberate fraud, this pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally. Some potential non-fraudulent explanations might include:

- An extraordinary statistical fluke (extremely improbable)
- Unconscious researcher biases in analysis decisions
- Publication bias (if these are results from multiple studies)

However, for a single study with multiple analyses showing this pattern, the likelihood of this occurring without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting is very low. This is precisely why statisticians look for this distribution pattern when investigating potential research impropriety.

Given the description of an "unusually high concentration" below .05 and "almost no" p-values just above, this pattern would be highly improbable without some form of inappropriate data handling or analysis practices.

I need to assess how likely it would be for a preregistration document to be modified after data collection if Lena did not commit misconduct.

Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent researchers from making post-hoc changes to analyses after seeing the data, as this can lead to p-hacking and false positives. Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, possible innocent explanations might include:

1. Genuine error: She might have believed updating the preregistration was acceptable if done transparently.
2. Miscommunication: Perhaps Professor Mills instructed her to update it without explaining this violates research norms.
3. Software issues: The lab's recent software switch could have caused file timestamp errors.
4. Lack of training: Lena might not have fully understood preregistration protocols.

However, these explanations have significant problems:
- As a third-year PhD student in neuroscience, Lena should understand basic research integrity principles.
- Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (not just analysis methods) after seeing data is a fundamental violation of preregistration.
- The modifications specifically affected criteria that determine which data points are included and which outcomes are considered "primary" - both highly consequential for statistical results.
- The timing (after data collection) suggests the changes could have been motivated by the data's appearance.

Even with honest intentions, modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents a serious deviation from proper scientific procedure. While not impossible that this occurred without misconduct intent, it's quite unlikely given Lena's training level and the nature of the changes.

35
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are certainly plausible reasons why she might have written these emails:

1. Academic pressure is real and widely acknowledged. PhD students often feel intense pressure for their studies to produce positive results, especially in high-profile experiments.

2. The statements about her supervisor "counting on this study to save the grant" could be a genuine reflection of pressure communicated by Professor Mills, without implying Lena would compromise her integrity.

3. The concern about null results harming postdoc chances reflects a realistic understanding of academic incentives. Publication bias favoring positive results is well-documented in science.

4. The phrase "I need this one to work" could express hope for a successful experiment rather than intention to manipulate data. Researchers naturally want their hypotheses to be supported, even while maintaining ethical standards.

5. Venting to a friend about pressure is common and doesn't necessarily indicate intent to commit misconduct. This could be a way of processing stress rather than signaling fraudulent intent.

These emails do show that Lena was under pressure and concerned about the outcome, which creates a motive for misconduct. However, experiencing and expressing such pressure is extremely common in academia. Many researchers face these exact pressures and express similar sentiments without ever committing misconduct.

The emails demonstrate career anxiety and awareness of the incentive structure in academia, but don't necessarily indicate misconduct occurred.

70
To assess this scenario, I need to consider whether excluding participants between draft and final analyses could have legitimate explanations if Lena did not commit misconduct.

There are several innocent reasons why participants might be legitimately excluded between analysis versions:

1. Data quality checks: After initial analyses, Lena might have identified participants who failed attention checks, had excessive movement artifacts (common in neuroscience studies), or showed other data quality issues that weren't immediately apparent.

2. Refined exclusion criteria: She might have realized certain participants didn't actually meet inclusion criteria after closer examination of demographic or performance data.

3. Outlier detection: Standard statistical procedures often involve identifying outliers after preliminary analyses, which could lead to legitimate exclusions.

4. Reviewer suggestions: If the paper had been through review, reviewers might have suggested more stringent inclusion criteria.

5. Consultation with colleagues: Discussions with Professor Mills or other lab members might have led to legitimate refinement of the participant sample.

However, there are concerning elements:

- This occurred alongside other questionable practices (modified preregistration)
- The preregistration was reportedly modified to change exclusion criteria after data collection
- The timing suggests the exclusions may have been motivated by seeing initial results

Participant exclusion is a common and legitimate practice in cognitive neuroscience, but should be done transparently and according to pre-specified criteria. If the criteria were changed post-hoc without transparent justification, that's problematic.

Given the context but acknowledging legitimate scenarios exist for participant exclusion, I estimate:

60
If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, a dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 would be quite unlikely. Let me explain why:

From a statistical perspective, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution under the null hypothesis, or a right-skewed distribution under true effects. However, there's no natural statistical mechanism that would create a sharp discontinuity or "bunching" just below the conventional .05 significance threshold while leaving a "gap" just above it.

Potential innocent explanations could include:

1. Pure coincidence - extremely unlikely given multiple analyses showing this pattern
2. Publication bias affecting which exploratory analyses were reported - but this doesn't explain the absence of values just above .05
3. Some peculiarity of the specific statistical tests used - but standard statistical tests don't produce this pattern naturally
4. A genuine but unusual characteristic of the underlying phenomenon being studied - highly implausible as real effects don't "know" about the .05 threshold

The clustering described is exactly what we would expect from p-hacking techniques such as:
- Running analyses repeatedly with slight variations until p < .05
- Selectively excluding certain data points
- Testing multiple outcomes and only reporting those below the threshold
- Stopping data collection when a desired p-value is reached

Several meta-scientific studies have documented this exact pattern (p-values clustered just below .05 with few just above) as a telltale sign of publication bias and questionable research practices in the scientific literature.

While not impossible without misconduct, this distribution is statistically highly improbable without some form of selective reporting or analysis.

I need to evaluate the likelihood of observing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (with almost none just above) if Lena did not commit misconduct.

This pattern of p-values clustering just below the significance threshold of .05 is known as "p-hacking" or "researcher degrees of freedom" in statistics. It's a well-documented phenomenon in research literature.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, there are several possible explanations:

1. **Random chance**: While possible, it's statistically unlikely to see many p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above by chance alone. P-values should generally follow a uniform or continuous distribution if the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution if there are true effects.

2. **Selective reporting of analyses**: Lena might have conducted multiple legitimate analyses but only reported those that reached significance. This isn't fabrication but represents a form of publication bias.

3. **Researcher degrees of freedom**: Lena might have made a series of seemingly reasonable analytical decisions (excluding outliers, trying different covariates, etc.) until finding significant results. This can happen unconsciously.

4. **Software issues**: The mentioned software switch could potentially affect calculation methods, but this would typically not create a specific clustering below .05.

5. **File recovery issues**: The hard drive failure might explain missing documentation, but wouldn't explain the specific p-value pattern.

Given the described pattern - many p-values just below .05 and almost none just above - this distribution is highly suspicious from a statistical perspective. Such a pattern rarely occurs naturally. While not impossible through legitimate means, the specific clustering around the significance threshold is a classic signature of p-hacking or data manipulation.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, this pattern would be quite unlikely to emerge spontaneously, especially across multiple exploratory analyses.

15
I need to evaluate whether Lena's email statements are consistent with someone who did not commit academic misconduct.

The emails reveal several concerning attitudes, but they don't necessarily prove misconduct. Let me analyze each statement:

1. **"Counting on this study to save the grant"**: This reflects a common reality in academia where funding continuity often depends on producing positive results. Many honest researchers feel this pressure without compromising their integrity. This statement acknowledges the stakes but doesn't indicate Lena planned to manipulate data.

2. **"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc"**: This statement reflects the "publication bias" problem in academia where positive findings are more publishable than negative ones. Many early-career researchers accurately understand that their career prospects depend on publishable results. This is a systemic issue that honest researchers navigate.

3. **"I need this one to work"**: This is the most concerning statement, as "work" could be interpreted as "produce significant results" rather than "be conducted properly." However, it could also simply express hope for a meaningful outcome or reflect anxiety about the experiment's execution rather than its results.

These statements definitely show that Lena was under pressure and understood the career implications of her research outcomes. However, acknowledging career pressure is different from acting unethically in response to it. Many researchers express similar sentiments in private conversations while still maintaining research integrity.

The statements reveal career anxiety and awareness of incentive structures in academia rather than explicitly indicating an intent to fabricate or manipulate data. A researcher could write these exact statements while still planning to conduct their research with complete integrity.

That said, these statements do indicate that Lena had a motive for misconduct, even if they don't prove she acted on that motive. They show she was acutely aware of the professional consequences of null results, creating a situation where the temptation to cut corners might be higher.

65
Excluding participants between an earlier and final analysis is a common practice in legitimate research, and there are several valid reasons why this might occur:

1. **Pre-specified exclusion criteria**: Many studies have predetermined criteria for excluding participants, such as performance below a certain threshold, failure to follow instructions, or technical issues during data collection. Applying these criteria legitimately results in participant exclusion.

2. **Data quality issues**: Researchers often identify problematic data after initial analyses. This could include participants who were inattentive, provided random responses, or whose data contained recording errors or artifacts (especially common in cognitive neuroscience with EEG/fMRI data).

3. **Outlier identification**: Statistical outliers might be legitimately identified and removed after preliminary analyses. Standard statistical procedures often recommend removing data points that are several standard deviations from the mean.

4. **Protocol violations**: Participants who didn't follow experimental protocols might be discovered during data inspection and legitimately removed.

5. **Post-hoc but legitimate exclusions**: Sometimes valid exclusion criteria emerge only after examining the data (e.g., discovering that certain participants misunderstood instructions in a systematic way).

6. **Reviewer suggestions**: It's also common for peer reviewers to suggest additional exclusion criteria that researchers then implement in revised analyses.

The key considerations for legitimate exclusions are:
- They follow transparent, defensible criteria
- They would have been applied regardless of how they affect the results
- They are fully documented in the final paper

In cognitive neuroscience specifically, participant exclusion is particularly common due to the complex nature of the data and susceptibility to artifacts.

Without specific details on why the participants were excluded, the mere fact that exclusions occurred between early and final analyses is consistent with normal, ethical research practices. Many legitimate studies go through multiple versions of analyses with different participant sets.

75
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration, which is to establish analysis plans before seeing the data. This is a serious issue in research methodology.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are a few potential explanations for these modifications:

1. **Administrative error or misunderstanding**: Lena might not have fully understood preregistration protocols. She might have viewed the document as a "living" document to be updated throughout the research process rather than understanding its purpose as a fixed pre-data declaration of methods.

2. **Technical documentation**: The modifications might have been clarifications or corrections to errors in the original document rather than substantive changes to the analysis plan. However, changing primary outcomes goes beyond simple clarification.

3. **Legitimate protocol amendment**: In some cases, researchers do amend preregistrations, but this should be done transparently through formal amendment processes that clearly distinguish the original plan from later changes. This doesn't appear to be the case here.

4. **Poor research practices but not deliberate misconduct**: There's a gray area between outright fraud and inadequate research practices. Lena might have modified the document believing this was acceptable without understanding it constitutes a serious methodological problem.

5. **Accidental file changes**: Opening and saving a document without intentionally changing content can sometimes update timestamps, but this wouldn't explain actual changes to exclusion criteria and outcomes.

Even without deliberate misconduct, modifying preregistered outcomes and exclusion criteria after data collection represents a severe violation of research methodology. This practice fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and creates significant potential for bias.

The scientific community generally considers changing preregistered primary outcomes after seeing the data to be one of the most problematic research practices, as it allows researchers to selectively report favorable results while appearing to follow rigorous methods.

If Lena did not intend to mislead, this would represent an extremely poor understanding of research methodology that borders on incompetence for a third-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience.

# Analysis of Suspicious p-value Distribution

The distribution of p-values described - with many values just below the significance threshold of .05 (like .047, .049, .041) and almost none just above .05 - is a well-known red flag in scientific research. This pattern requires careful analysis.

## Statistical Perspective

In legitimate research with true null hypotheses, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Even when there are true effects, we would expect to see a relatively smooth distribution of p-values, not a sharp discontinuity exactly at the significance threshold.

## Potential Innocent Explanations

1. **Multiple Comparisons/Exploratory Analyses**: If Lena conducted many exploratory analyses but only reported the significant ones (p-value harvesting), this could create a clustering below .05. This is problematic methodologically but not necessarily fraudulent.

2. **Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: Decisions about data cleaning, outlier exclusion, or stopping rules can inadvertently push borderline results into significance. Again, this reflects methodological issues rather than fraud.

3. **Software Change**: The lab's switch to new software could potentially affect analysis outcomes in unpredictable ways.

4. **Publication Bias**: There might be pressure to find significant results, leading to unconscious decisions that favor significant findings.

## Suspicious Elements

However, the specific pattern described - many p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above - is extremely unlikely to occur naturally. This pattern typically emerges when researchers manipulate analyses until achieving significance ("p-hacking") or directly alter values.

The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly suspicious. In genuine research, we would expect to see values both slightly below and slightly above the threshold.

## Probability Assessment

Given that:
- The clustering occurs in multiple exploratory analyses
- There's a stark discontinuity exactly at p=.05
- This pattern matches known signatures of p-hacking
- The main effect has p=.01, which is less suspicious than the exploratory analyses

If Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this specific pattern naturally is very low.

# Analysis of Lena's Email Statements Without Misconduct

These email statements reveal Lena's awareness of the pressure and stakes involved in her research, but they require careful interpretation regarding misconduct implications.

## Common Academic Pressures

1. **Grant Pressures**: The statement that her supervisor was "counting on this study to save the grant" reflects a common reality in academia. Funding often depends on producing significant results, and this pressure flows down from PIs to students.

2. **Career Concerns**: Saying "a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" acknowledges the publication bias in academia. Students know that prestigious postdocs often require high-impact publications, and null results are harder to publish.

3. **"I need this one to work"**: This ambiguous statement could mean several things:
   - She needs the experiment to run smoothly
   - She needs participants to follow instructions
   - She needs the data collection to be successful
   - She hopes the hypothesis will be supported

## Context for Non-Fraudulent Researchers

Many honest researchers express similar sentiments:

- Graduate students openly discuss career pressures
- The publish-or-perish culture creates genuine anxiety
- The difficulty publishing null results is a widely acknowledged problem
- Researchers invest in their hypotheses and naturally hope they're supported

## Probability Assessment Factors

1. These statements express pressure and hope, not intent to manipulate data
2. Such comments are relatively common in private communications between peers in academia
3. Acknowledging external pressures doesn't necessarily indicate willingness to commit fraud
4. The statements reflect structural problems in academia that affect honest researchers too
5. In confidential emails to friends, researchers often vent about pressures they face

## Conclusion

While these statements reveal concerning pressures in the research environment, they are consistent with the experiences of many graduate students who conduct their research with integrity despite systemic pressures. An honest researcher might well make these exact statements while still maintaining research integrity.

# Analysis of Participant Exclusion Without Misconduct

The exclusion of participants between early and final versions of an analysis script is a common occurrence in research and can happen for many legitimate reasons.

## Valid Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Pre-established Exclusion Criteria**: Researchers often define criteria before data analysis that require excluding certain participants:
   - Performance below attention check thresholds
   - Failure to complete all experimental tasks
   - Technical issues during data collection
   - Outlier responses based on standard statistical criteria

2. **Post-hoc but Legitimate Exclusions**:
   - Discovering participants who misunderstood instructions
   - Identifying equipment malfunctions that affected specific participants
   - Recognizing contaminated data (e.g., excessive movement in neuroimaging)
   - Finding participants who don't meet inclusion criteria that wasn't initially screened

3. **Analytical Refinement**:
   - Reviewers suggesting more stringent exclusion criteria
   - Consultation with colleagues leading to justified methodological improvements
   - Discovering issues during analysis that weren't apparent during data collection

## Common Research Practices

It's standard practice to refine analysis approaches as a project develops. Initial scripts often include all collected data before applying exclusion criteria. This allows researchers to:
- Compare results with and without exclusions
- Document the impact of each methodological decision
- Maintain transparency about the full dataset

## Evaluation of Legitimacy

The key factors in determining whether exclusions are legitimate include:
- Whether exclusion criteria were determined a priori
- If post-hoc exclusions have clear methodological justification
- Documentation and transparency about exclusion decisions
- Whether exclusions follow field standards and best practices

Without evidence of problematic intent, participant exclusion between analysis versions is a normal part of the research process. Nearly all published studies involve some level of data exclusion from initial collection to final analysis.

## Conclusion

Participant exclusion between early and final analysis scripts is extremely common in legitimate research and would be expected in most studies of this complexity.

# Analysis of Post-Collection Preregistration Modification Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is highly problematic from a research integrity perspective. However, I'll examine potential non-fraudulent explanations.

## Fundamental Issues with Post-Collection Modifications

Preregistration's core purpose is to commit to analysis plans before seeing data, preventing hypothesis-after-results-are-known (HARKing) and p-hacking. Changing these elements after data collection directly undermines this purpose.

## Possible Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error**: 
   - Uploading the wrong version of a document
   - Correcting typographical errors or clarifying ambiguous language
   - However, these wouldn't typically involve changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes

2. **Misunderstanding of Preregistration Requirements**:
   - A researcher might incorrectly believe updating preregistration is acceptable
   - Junior researchers might not understand the timing requirements
   - However, most platforms explicitly warn against post-data modifications

3. **Technical Issues**:
   - File might have been modified only to fix formatting problems
   - Timestamp issues could theoretically exist
   - However, changing substantive content like exclusion criteria doesn't fit this explanation

4. **Transparent Documentation of Changes**:
   - Legitimate modifications would typically be transparently documented
   - Changes would be noted in the manuscript with justification
   - The original preregistration would still be referenced

## Statistical and Ethical Considerations

Even without fraudulent intent, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing data is considered a serious deviation from good scientific practice. This creates a significant risk of unconscious bias influencing analytical decisions.

## Research on Preregistration Practices

Research on preregistration compliance shows that deviations from preregistered plans are common, but transparent reporting of these deviations is the expected standard. Modifying the preregistration document itself (rather than noting deviations in the paper) is exceptionally problematic.

## Probability Assessment

The specific modifications to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection, without apparent documentation of these changes, is extremely difficult to reconcile with good research practice, even
# Analysis of Post-Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is fundamentally problematic from a research integrity standpoint. This practice directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analytical decisions before seeing the data.

## Purpose of Preregistration

The entire point of preregistration is to:
- Prevent hypothesizing after results are known (HARKing)
- Eliminate selective reporting of analyses that "worked"
- Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- Prevent researchers from changing their analytical approach based on results

## Legitimate Explanations?

The legitimate reasons for modifying a preregistration after data collection are extremely limited:

1. **Correcting Genuine Errors**: Fixing typos or clarifying ambiguous language without changing the substantive plan.

2. **Administrative Updates**: Adding IRB approval numbers or other non-methodological information.

3. **Transparent Documentation**: Adding an addendum explicitly labeled as a post-data modification with clear justification.

None of these legitimate reasons would involve changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection.

## Assessment of This Scenario

In this case, the modifications involved:
- Changing exclusion criteria (which directly affects which data points are analyzed)
- Altering primary outcomes (which changes what the study claims to be testing)

These modifications go to the heart of what preregistration aims to prevent. They represent changes to the fundamental analytical decisions that should be made before data is examined.

## Standard Research Practice

In proper scientific practice, if researchers discover issues with their preregistered plan after collecting data, they should:
1. Keep the original preregistration unchanged
2. Report deviations transparently in the final paper
3. Clearly label any post-hoc analyses as exploratory
4. Acknowledge limitations in interpretation

## Conclusion

Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes in a preregistration after data collection is a serious breach of research methodology that fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration. While it doesn't necessarily prove intentional fraud, it represents either a significant methodological error or an attempt to make exploratory analyses appear confirmatory.

Even without fraudulent intent
# Analysis of Post-Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

The modification of a preregistration document after data collection, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a serious deviation from proper research practices. Let's examine how likely this might be without deliberate misconduct.

## Fundamental Purpose of Preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making analysis decisions after seeing the data, as this introduces confirmation bias and allows p-hacking. Changes to key elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly undermine this purpose.

## Possible Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Genuine Misunderstanding of Preregistration**: Some researchers, especially students, might misunderstand preregistration as a "living document" rather than a binding commitment.

2. **Administrative/Version Control Error**: Someone might have:
   - Made minor formatting changes and accidentally re-saved the substantive content
   - Updated the wrong file thinking it was a different document
   - Attempted to create a transparent addendum but used the wrong process

3. **Poorly Documented Amendments**: Legitimate amendments to preregistrations are possible, but should be:
   - Clearly marked as post-hoc changes
   - Accompanied by justifications
   - Transparent about timing
   - Registered as formal amendments

4. **Supervision Gaps**: Lena's supervisor might have instructed changes without explaining proper amendment procedures.

## Problematic Aspects Even Without Fraud

Even without intentional deception, modifying preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:
- Violates research integrity principles
- Invalidates the methodological protection preregistration provides
- Constitutes a serious QRP (questionable research practice)
- Demonstrates poor understanding of scientific methods

## Frequency in Research

While studies show QRPs are relatively common, direct modification of preregistration documents (rather than deviation from them) is much rarer, as most platforms have safeguards against this or provide amendment processes.

## Assessment

The modification of preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be highly unusual without misconduct. While honest errors or misunderstandings could explain this, they represent a very small probability given the fundamental nature of pre
# Analysis of Post-Data Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration. However, I need to evaluate if this could occur without misconduct.

## The Purpose of Preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making analysis decisions after seeing their data. Its core function is to:
- Document hypotheses before data collection
- Specify analytical approaches in advance
- Commit to primary outcomes before results are known
- Define exclusion criteria before seeing which participants affect results

## Potential Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error or Misunderstanding**:
   - Lena might not understand that modifying preregistration after data collection violates research principles
   - She might have confused updating the registration platform with changing the actual registered plan

2. **Documentation Updates Without Analytical Changes**:
   - Correcting typographical errors or clarifying ambiguous language
   - Adding supplementary information requested by colleagues or reviewers while maintaining original analytical plans

3. **Technical Issues**:
   - File timestamp errors showing incorrect modification dates
   - Software that automatically updates timestamps when documents are accessed but not changed

4. **Transparency About Changes**:
   - If Lena openly documented and justified all modifications in her manuscript and noted them as deviations from the original plan

## Problems With Post-Data Modification

Even with benign intentions, modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection:
- Invalidates the methodological protection that preregistration provides
- Creates researcher degrees of freedom that preregistration aims to eliminate
- Allows for potential unconscious bias in analytical decisions
- Violates standard research practices even without deliberate fraud

## Evaluation

Changing preregistration after data collection, specifically altering exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a serious methodological violation. While not necessarily involving fabrication or falsification, it fundamentally undermines research integrity and is extremely difficult to justify through honest error or misunderstanding, especially for a third-year PhD student who should understand these principles.

The nature of the specific changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) makes innocent explanation particularly unlikely, as these are precisely the
# Analysis of Post-Data-Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration. However, I need to consider whether this could occur without misconduct.

## Purpose of Preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making decisions after seeing their data. The core principles include:
- Defining hypotheses before data collection
- Specifying analysis plans in advance
- Establishing exclusion criteria prior to knowing results
- Identifying primary outcomes before seeing which show significant effects

## Potential Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error**: 
   - Someone might have corrected typos or formatting without realizing the implications
   - Changes might have been made to align with an earlier verbal agreement not properly documented
   - File might have been re-saved without intentional changes, altering the timestamp

2. **Misunderstanding of Preregistration**:
   - Lena might have incorrectly believed updates were acceptable
   - She might have been trying to make the document more accurate/complete
   - There could be confusion between draft and final versions

3. **Technical Issues**:
   - Version control problems could have led to saving an older draft with a newer timestamp
   - Changes might have been made to fix technical errors in analysis code descriptions
   - Cloud syncing issues might have affected file dates

## Serious Problems

Even without intentional misconduct, these changes represent a severe methodological violation:
- They undermine the entire purpose of preregistration
- They invalidate the confirmatory nature of the analyses
- They represent extremely poor research practices

## Assessment

While technical glitches or severe misunderstanding of scientific protocols could explain this, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is fundamentally incompatible with proper research methodology. The specific changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (not just formatting or minor clarifications) make innocent explanations particularly unlikely.

Even without deliberate fraud, this represents a serious breach of research integrity that most scientific bodies would consider questionable research practice at minimum.

I need to assess whether these email statements are consistent with innocent behavior or indicative of misconduct.

Looking at the emails objectively, I notice they reflect the reality of academic pressures rather than necessarily indicating fraudulent intent:

1. "My supervisor is counting on this study to save the grant" - This is likely a factual statement about the pressure Professor Mills is under, as explicitly mentioned in the scenario. Many academics openly acknowledge the grant pressures their labs face.

2. "A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" - This reflects a genuine concern in academia where positive results are often more publishable and career-advancing than null results. This is a systemic issue in science that many researchers discuss openly.

3. "I need this one to work" - While this could be interpreted as motivation to manipulate data, it could equally express hope for a successful study. Researchers naturally hope their hypotheses are supported, even while maintaining integrity.

These statements primarily reveal the problematic incentive structures in academia rather than proving misconduct. Many honest researchers would acknowledge these pressures while still conducting research ethically. The statements show awareness of career incentives but don't directly suggest willingness to fabricate results.

In fact, an honest researcher might be more likely to candidly discuss these pressures with a friend, whereas someone planning misconduct might avoid creating such written evidence.

Therefore, these emails are quite compatible with the behavior of an honest researcher navigating a high-pressure academic environment.

Probability that an honest researcher would write such emails: 75
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is a significant issue to evaluate in the context of research integrity.

Preregistration is specifically designed to prevent researchers from making post-hoc adjustments to analyses based on what produces significant results. Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is generally considered a form of p-hacking or data manipulation.

If Lena did not commit misconduct, there are only limited legitimate scenarios that could explain such modifications:

1. Technical error or misunderstanding: Perhaps Lena believed she was updating documentation rather than the actual preregistration, or didn't understand that modifications weren't allowed after data collection.

2. Administrative correction: In rare cases, researchers might correct obvious errors or typos in preregistration documents. However, changing substantive elements like exclusion criteria or primary outcomes goes well beyond this.

3. Confusion about timing: If there was confusion about when data collection officially began, Lena might have mistakenly thought modifications were still permissible.

4. Software transition issues: The scenario mentions the lab recently switched software, which could potentially create file timestamp discrepancies that make legitimate modifications appear to have occurred after data collection.

However, these explanations have significant limitations. The research community considers preregistration modifications after data collection to be improper, and the specific changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are particularly problematic elements that directly impact statistical significance. Any competent researcher should understand these principles, especially a third-year PhD student.

Furthermore, these aren't minor tweaks but changes to fundamental analysis parameters that determine which data points are analyzed and which outcomes are considered primary (versus exploratory). This pattern strongly suggests outcome-oriented adjustments.

Probability that a researcher not committing misconduct would modify preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes: 15
This distribution pattern of p-values is important to analyze carefully. In genuinely conducted research without misconduct, p-values should follow certain expected distributions.

When examining the statistical properties of p-values in legitimate research:

1. If the null hypothesis is true (no real effect), p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means we should see roughly equal numbers of p-values in any equal-sized range (e.g., similar numbers between .04-.05 as between .05-.06).

2. If there are true effects (null hypothesis is false), we'd expect a right-skewed distribution with more very low p-values (e.g., below .01) and progressively fewer as we approach 1.

3. Random chance can create some clustering, but having multiple p-values clustered just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 is statistically suspicious and creates what statisticians call a "p-value cliff" at .05.

For innocent explanations:

1. Publication bias: Researchers might report only analyses that reached significance, but this doesn't explain why there would be no p-values just above .05 in exploratory analyses.

2. Small sample effects: Small samples can produce volatile p-values, but this volatility should work in both directions around .05.

3. Coincidence: By chance, several analyses could fall just below .05, but the probability of multiple analyses falling just below with almost none just above is extremely low.

4. Analysis choices: Legitimate analytical decisions might affect p-values, but these shouldn't systematically push values from just above to just below .05.

This distribution pattern is well-documented in statistical literature as a red flag for p-hacking or selective reporting. It occurs when researchers conduct multiple analyses or apply different exclusion criteria until achieving significance. The natural statistical distribution of p-values makes this pattern extremely unlikely to occur by chance or through legitimate research practices.

Probability that a researcher not committing misconduct would produce data with an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above: 5
When assessing whether the exclusion of participants between early and final analyses is consistent with ethical research practices, I need to consider legitimate reasons for participant exclusion alongside the broader context.

In ethical research, participant exclusion can occur for several valid reasons:

1. Application of pre-registered exclusion criteria: Researchers often remove participants who fail attention checks, have excessive missing data, or show evidence of not following instructions properly.

2. Identification of technical issues: Sometimes data quality problems are discovered during analysis (equipment malfunction, participant misunderstanding of tasks, etc.).

3. Outlier detection: Standard statistical procedures sometimes warrant removing extreme outliers, though this should follow pre-specified criteria.

4. Refinement of inclusion criteria: Early exploratory analyses might lead to refinements in inclusion parameters for scientific reasons.

However, this scenario needs to be viewed in conjunction with the other concerning elements:

- The preregistration was modified after data collection
- There's an unusual concentration of p-values just below .05
- The context involves pressure for positive results

The fact that participant exclusion occurred between versions raises questions, especially if:
- The exclusion criteria weren't part of the original preregistration
- The excluded participants' data would have made results non-significant
- The exclusions weren't documented transparently

That said, in isolation, finding that some participants were excluded between analysis versions is not uncommon in legitimate research. The key question is whether the exclusions followed proper methodological principles or were outcome-driven.

Given that participant exclusion can be legitimate but also can be misused, and considering the other red flags in this case but without direct evidence that these specific exclusions were improper:

Probability that a researcher not committing misconduct would have earlier scripts with more participants than the final dataset: 60

# Analysis of P-value Distribution Pattern

The distribution of p-values described - with an unusually high concentration just below .05 and very few just above .05 - is a recognized statistical anomaly that raises concerns in research integrity analysis.

## Statistical Context
In genuine data analysis with no selective reporting:
- P-values should follow a uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true)
- Or they should be skewed toward 0 (if there are true effects)
- There should not be a sharp discontinuity at p = .05

## Legitimate Explanations?
Could this pattern emerge without misconduct?

1. **Multiple Analyses Without Correction**: Running many exploratory analyses increases chances of finding some p-values under .05, but this wouldn't explain the discontinuity at precisely .05.

2. **Publication Bias**: Researchers sometimes fail to report analyses with p > .05, but this typically happens between studies, not within a single dataset.

3. **P-hacking Without Intent**: Researchers might try different analysis approaches until finding significant results, possibly without realizing this invalidates statistical inference. However, this still constitutes questionable research practices.

4. **Software Issues**: The lab's software switch could potentially create anomalies, but it's extremely unlikely to create this specific pattern around .05.

## Statistical Unlikelihood
The clustering of p-values just below .05 with a drop-off just above .05 is statistically very improbable under legitimate analysis. This pattern is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of selective reporting or data manipulation in research integrity investigations.

While honest errors can explain many data irregularities, this specific p-value distribution is extraordinarily difficult to attribute to chance or innocent mistakes. It strongly suggests some form of p-hacking or selective reporting occurred, whether Lena was aware of its impropriety or not.

Probability that this p-value distribution would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 8
# Likelihood of Post-Data Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Preregistration serves a critical function in research integrity: it documents analysis plans before data collection to prevent researchers from making decisions influenced by seeing the results. Modifying preregistration documents after data collection, particularly to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, directly undermines this purpose.

## Valid Reasons for Post-Data Modifications?

In legitimate research practice, there are very few acceptable scenarios for modifying preregistration after data collection:

1. **Documentation of Deviations**: Researchers might update a preregistration to note deviations from the original plan, but this should be clearly marked as a post-data amendment, not changing the original plan itself.

2. **Correction of Genuine Errors**: If the preregistration contained obvious errors (e.g., typos, incorrect formula notation), corrections might be made, but changing actual methodological decisions is problematic.

3. **Technical Platform Requirements**: Some preregistration platforms might require format updates, but this wouldn't involve changing substantive content like exclusion criteria or primary outcomes.

## Why This Is Particularly Problematic

Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing data is especially concerning because:

1. These are precisely the factors that most directly influence whether analyses yield significant results
2. Modifying them after data collection allows researchers to select criteria that produce desired outcomes
3. This undermines the entire purpose of preregistration as a safeguard against researcher degrees of freedom

## Scientific Norms and Expectations

In standard scientific practice:
- Preregistration documents are considered fixed after data collection begins
- Changes require transparent documentation as deviations, not modifications to the original plan
- Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is widely recognized as a serious breach of research methodology

While honest administrative errors can occur in research, the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) aligns precisely with what would be modified to achieve significant results. The probability of this occurring innocently is extremely low.

Probability that this would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 5
# Likelihood of These Email Statements Without Misconduct

These email statements reflect the real pressures and concerns that many researchers, particularly PhD students, face in academia. They demonstrate awareness of publication bias and career incentives, but don't necessarily indicate misconduct.

## Common Academic Pressures

The statements in Lena's emails reflect several well-documented realities in academic research:

1. **Grant Pressure**: Research labs often depend on continued grant funding for survival. It's entirely normal for a supervisor to communicate the importance of certain studies for securing future funding.

2. **Publication Bias**: Academia's "publish or perish" culture creates genuine career pressure to produce positive results. Null findings are less likely to be published in high-impact journals, despite their scientific value.

3. **Career Advancement Concerns**: The competitive academic job market does indeed favor candidates with "successful" studies. Lena's concern about postdoc prospects is realistic.

## Expression vs. Action

Expressing frustration, anxiety, and awareness of systemic pressures is fundamentally different from acting unethically in response to those pressures. Many researchers:

- Openly discuss these systemic problems with peers
- Feel genuine stress about the career implications of their results
- Hope for supportive findings while maintaining research integrity
- Use such conversations as a way to vent about structural problems in academia

## Context Matters

These statements could reflect:
- Normal venting to a trusted friend
- Acknowledgment of systemic pressures without intention to compromise ethics
- Anxiety about factors outside her control
- A desire for the theory being tested to be validated through legitimate means

Many ethical researchers make similar statements while still maintaining research integrity. The statements show awareness of problematic incentives in academia but don't themselves prove misconduct.

These emails do reveal that Lena had motivation to produce positive results, which is a risk factor for misconduct. However, acknowledging career pressures and hoping for positive outcomes is extremely common among researchers who never cross ethical lines.

Probability that Lena would write these emails if she did not commit academic misconduct: 75
# Likelihood of Participant Exclusions Without Misconduct

Finding that an earlier analysis script included participants who were later excluded from the final dataset could be consistent with legitimate research practices under certain circumstances. Let's examine when this might occur innocently versus when it raises concerns.

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Preregistered Exclusion Criteria Applied Late**: Researchers might run initial analyses on all data before applying planned exclusion criteria.

2. **Quality Control Discoveries**: Issues might be discovered during analysis that justify exclusion:
   - Participants who didn't follow instructions
   - Equipment malfunctions identified during data processing
   - Response patterns indicating inattention
   - Outliers based on objective criteria

3. **Technical or Procedural Errors**:
   - Accidentally including pilot participants in early analyses
   - Discovering protocol violations after initial processing
   - Identifying participants who didn't meet inclusion criteria

4. **Iterative Data Cleaning Process**:
   - Sequential refinement of the dataset is normal in research
   - Documentation of each step should exist
   - Changes should follow transparent criteria

## Concerning Factors in This Case

However, several contextual factors make this more problematic:

1. This occurs alongside other suspicious patterns (p-values clustered below .05)
2. The preregistration document was modified after data collection
3. The exclusions weren't documented in a transparent audit trail

## Evaluation in Research Context

In standard research practice:
- Participant exclusions should follow predetermined criteria
- Changes should be documented with justification
- The process should be transparent and replicable

Given the other elements in this case, the exclusion of participants between versions raises significant concerns. While there are legitimate reasons this could happen, the probability is reduced by the context of other questionable practices already identified.

The existence of earlier and later versions itself is not unusual, but the pattern of exclusions would need strong, documented justification to be considered standard research practice.

Probability that this would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct: 35

I need to consider how likely it is that an innocent explanation exists for excluding participants between the earlier and final analyses.

In cognitive neuroscience research, it's actually quite common to exclude participants after initial data collection and analysis for legitimate reasons:

1. Exclusion criteria are often applied post-hoc when participants are found to have not followed instructions properly, shown excessive movement during neuroimaging, or performed at chance levels on key tasks.

2. Outlier removal is a standard practice when participants show response patterns that deviate significantly from the norm.

3. Technical issues during data collection (equipment failure, participant distraction, etc.) may only become apparent during initial analysis.

4. Reviewers might have suggested more stringent inclusion criteria during the review process, which is a common occurrence in peer review.

5. As the lab switched software, compatibility issues might have necessitated excluding certain data formats or participants with incomplete datasets.

Given these considerations, it would be entirely normal for a legitimate analysis to exclude some participants from an initial larger sample. In fact, most cognitive neuroscience studies go through this refinement process. The key would be whether these exclusions were:
- Based on pre-specified criteria
- Applied consistently
- Properly documented
- Not selectively applied just to achieve significance

The presence of excluded participants by itself is extremely common in honest research and provides very little evidence of misconduct. The more important questions would relate to the justification for those exclusions and whether they were selectively applied.

75
Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research protocol that goes against the core purpose of preregistration. If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are very few legitimate explanations for this behavior:

1. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from making post-hoc changes to analyses based on what they see in the data. The whole point is to declare analysis plans before seeing results.

2. Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data is particularly problematic, as it allows researchers to selectively include/exclude participants to achieve desired outcomes.

3. Modifying primary outcomes after data collection is one of the clearest forms of inappropriate researcher degrees of freedom, as it allows changing what "counts" as success after seeing what worked.

For an innocent explanation to exist:
- There might have been a clerical error where an updated version of the preregistration was uploaded to replace a corrupted or incomplete file, but this should have been documented and dated appropriately.
- The modifications could reflect correcting genuine errors in the original preregistration, but this should be transparent and typically would be handled through registered addenda, not by modifying the original document.
- Perhaps Lena was unaware that modifying preregistrations after data collection violates scientific norms, but this would reflect serious negligence for a third-year PhD student in neuroscience.

Even if Lena had legitimate reasons to adjust analyses, the proper procedure would be to acknowledge deviations from the preregistration transparently in the manuscript, not to modify the preregistration itself.

The likelihood that this occurred without academic misconduct is very low.

15
These email statements, while concerning on their surface, could plausibly be made by a researcher who feels pressure but doesn't cross into misconduct. Let me analyze each statement in the context of academic research culture:

1. "Counting on this study to save the grant" - This reflects the reality of academic funding pressures. Many labs depend on positive results to secure continued funding, and PIs often communicate these stakes to their students. A researcher could acknowledge this pressure while still conducting honest research.

2. "A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc" - This unfortunately reflects the publication bias in academia. Students are aware that null results are harder to publish in high-impact journals, and publication records strongly influence postdoc opportunities. Recognizing this career reality doesn't mean a researcher would falsify data.

3. "I need this one to work" - This ambiguous statement could mean either "I need to manipulate the data" or simply "I hope we find significant results through valid methods." Many honest researchers hope for significant findings while still accepting whatever the data actually shows.

These statements reveal career anxiety and publication pressure that are sadly common in academia. A researcher could express these concerns to a friend while venting, yet still maintain scientific integrity in their actual work. The statements show motivation for potential misconduct but don't themselves prove misconduct occurred.

Many scientists experience these pressures and express similar sentiments privately while still conducting rigorous, honest research. These emails demonstrate the problematic incentive structures in academia more than they necessarily demonstrate misconduct by Lena.

65
This pattern of p-values - many just below .05 and few just above - is statistically anomalous in ways that are difficult to explain through legitimate research practices. Let me break down why this is unlikely in the absence of misconduct:

1. In genuine research, p-values should follow a relatively uniform distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) or be skewed toward very small values (if there's a true effect). A "bunching" of values just below the significance threshold of .05 is not expected naturally.

2. The probability of multiple independent exploratory analyses yielding results that cluster just below .05 is mathematically improbable. If these are truly exploratory analyses of real data, we would expect a more random distribution of p-values.

3. The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly telling. In honest research, there should be approximately as many p-values just above the threshold as just below it - the arbitrary cutoff of .05 has no meaning to the natural phenomena being studied.

4. This pattern (many p-values just below .05, few just above) has been extensively documented in meta-scientific research as a statistical fingerprint of p-hacking - where researchers analyze data multiple ways until finding significant results.

Even without misconduct, researcher degrees of freedom in analysis can sometimes produce this pattern unconsciously. However, for it to occur across multiple exploratory analyses with such a stark absence of p-values above .05 would be extremely unlikely without some form of selective reporting or data manipulation.

While there are hypothetical innocent explanations (extraordinary coincidence, unique characteristics of the specific phenomena being studied), their probability is very low compared to the explanation of selective reporting or analysis manipulation.

# Analysis of the P-value Distribution Pattern

The pattern described - a clustering of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 - is statistically suspicious and difficult to explain through legitimate research practices. Let me explain why:

## Statistical Expectations for P-value Distributions

In genuine research:
- P-values should follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis
- If there are true effects, we expect more low p-values (e.g., <.01) but not specifically a clustering just below .05
- The distribution around the .05 threshold should be relatively smooth, with similar numbers of values just below and just above .05

## Evaluating Innocent Explanations

Possible innocent explanations:
1. **Random chance**: Extremely unlikely to produce this specific pattern
2. **Software change**: Would typically affect all analyses equally, not cluster at threshold
3. **Multiple analyses**: Researchers sometimes run multiple tests but should report all of them
4. **Data exclusion criteria**: Legitimate exclusions shouldn't specifically target the .05 boundary

## Known Issues in Research Practices

The described pattern matches a well-documented phenomenon in research called "p-hacking" or "researcher degrees of freedom," where analyses are adjusted until results cross the significance threshold. This commonly produces exactly the pattern observed - a clustering just below .05.

## Conclusion and Probability Assessment

The distribution described is a classic statistical red flag. While not impossible under legitimate research practices, it is extremely unlikely. The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above strongly suggests some form of selective reporting or analysis manipulation.

The probability that this pattern would emerge naturally if Lena did not engage in questionable research practices is very low.

# Analysis of Participant Exclusion from Earlier to Final Dataset

Participant exclusion between analysis versions can be entirely legitimate in research. Let me analyze how likely this would be in the absence of misconduct:

## Legitimate Reasons for Participant Exclusion

1. **Predetermined Exclusion Criteria**: Researchers commonly establish criteria before data analysis, such as:
   - Performance below a certain threshold
   - Excessive movement in neuroimaging
   - Failure to follow instructions
   - Technical issues during data collection
   - Outlier detection based on standard methods

2. **Post-Data Collection Discovery**:
   - Participants who disclose relevant conditions after participation
   - Equipment malfunction identified during data processing
   - Discovery that participants didn't meet inclusion criteria

3. **Reviewer Suggestions**:
   - Peer reviewers often suggest stricter exclusion criteria
   - These suggestions may lead to legitimate participant removal

4. **Software Changes**:
   - The mentioned software switch could have revealed data quality issues not previously detected

## Normal Research Practice Context

In cognitive neuroscience specifically:
- Exclusion rates of 5-15% are common and often expected
- Data cleaning procedures are standard practice
- Exclusions should ideally be documented and justified

## Probability Assessment Factors

Supporting legitimate exclusion:
- Common practice in the field
- The existence of an audit trail (backup with previous version)
- Lena's previously strong record of careful data handling

Concerning factors:
- Timing in relation to the p-value distribution issue
- Connection to the suspicious clustering of p-values

## Conclusion

Participant exclusion between analysis versions is a normal part of the research process. While the context raises some questions given the p-value distribution, the practice itself is quite common in legitimate research, especially in cognitive neuroscience where data quality is paramount.

# Analysis of Lena's Email Comments Without Misconduct

These email statements reflect common pressures and concerns in academic research that many honest researchers experience. Let me analyze how likely these statements would be without misconduct:

## Publication Pressure in Academia

1. **Reality of Academic Incentives**:
   - The "publish or perish" culture is well-documented across scientific fields
   - Grant renewal often depends on positive publishable results
   - Career advancement (including postdoc positions) is strongly tied to publications
   - These pressures exist regardless of whether researchers engage in misconduct

2. **Normal Emotional Responses**:
   - Anxiety about research outcomes is extremely common
   - Expressing hopes for "positive" results is normal researcher behavior
   - Venting to friends about career concerns is a healthy coping mechanism

## Contextualizing Lena's Specific Comments

"Counting on this study to save the grant":
- Grants typically require demonstration of progress
- Principal investigators often prioritize promising projects for grant renewals
- This statement simply acknowledges the reality of grant funding mechanisms

"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc":
- Competitive postdoc positions often require publications
- This reflects understanding of the academic job market, not intent to manipulate
- Many fields undervalue null results despite reform efforts

"I need this one to work":
- Could express hope for genuine scientific discovery
- May reflect personal investment in the research question
- Expresses normal desire for career success

## Communication Context

- Private emails to friends typically contain more emotional and direct language
- Venting frustrations is different from declaring intent to manipulate data
- These statements acknowledge systemic pressures rather than indicating personal misconduct

## Conclusion

These statements reflect the genuine pressures faced by early-career researchers in a competitive academic environment. They express awareness of how science currently operates, including its flaws and incentive structures. Such comments would be common and natural for researchers whether or not they engage in misconduct. Even completely honest researchers frequently express these exact sentiments.

# Analysis of Post-Data Collection Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes fundamentally contradicts the purpose of preregistration itself. Let me analyze how likely this would be without intentional misconduct:

## Purpose and Principles of Preregistration

1. **Core Function of Preregistration**:
   - Preregistration exists specifically to document decisions before data collection
   - Its primary purpose is to prevent post-hoc changes to analyses
   - Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing data directly undermines this purpose

2. **Legitimate Post-Registration Updates**:
   - Minor clarifications or corrections to errors can be legitimate
   - Protocol deviations can be transparently reported
   - But these should be clearly marked as deviations, not modifications to the original document

## Possible Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error**:
   - Uploading the wrong version of a document
   - Timestamp errors due to file system issues

2. **Misunderstanding of Preregistration**:
   - Genuine confusion about proper procedures
   - Belief that updating for "clarity" was acceptable

3. **Unintentional Protocol Deviation**:
   - Realizing during data collection that original criteria were problematic
   - But proper procedure would be to document this separately, not modify the original

## Field Standards and Expectations

In cognitive neuroscience:
- Preregistration is increasingly standard practice
- As a third-year PhD student, Lena would likely have received training on proper procedures
- Professor Mills, as supervisor, would be expected to enforce proper standards

## Assessment Factors

The specific changes are concerning:
- Modifying exclusion criteria after data collection could directly influence results
- Changing primary outcomes is one of the most serious preregistration violations
- These specific changes align with the suspicious p-value distribution pattern

## Conclusion

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles. While administrative errors or misunderstandings are possible, the nature of these specific modifications (affecting key analytical decisions) makes innocent explanations significantly less pl
# Analysis of Post-Data Collection Preregistration Changes Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analytical decisions before seeing the data. Let me analyze how likely this would be without misconduct:

## Purpose and Principles of Preregistration

1. **Core Function**:
   - Preregistration exists specifically to prevent post-hoc changes to analyses
   - The scientific value comes from committing to methods before seeing results
   - Changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are precisely what preregistration aims to prevent

2. **Standard Protocol for Changes**:
   - Legitimate changes after preregistration should be:
     - Transparently documented as deviations from the original plan
     - Clearly labeled as exploratory rather than confirmatory
     - Not silently implemented through document modification

## Possible Non-Fraudulent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error**:
   - Uploading the wrong version of a document
   - Technical issues with the preregistration platform

2. **Misunderstanding of Process**:
   - Confusion about preregistration requirements
   - Lack of training in open science practices

3. **Documentation Issues**:
   - Attempting to update the document to reflect what was actually done
   - Confusing documentation with results reporting

## Severity Assessment

Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically:
- These are the most consequential elements that affect statistical results
- Modifications to these particular elements have the greatest potential to change outcomes
- These changes cannot be considered minor administrative updates

## Field Context

In cognitive neuroscience:
- Preregistration practices are increasingly standard
- A third-year PhD student would likely have received training on proper procedures
- The nature of the changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) addresses the exact elements most likely to affect significance

## Conclusion

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of preregistration. While there are possible innocent explanations, they would represent serious methodological errors that undermine scientific integrity, even if not deliberate fraud. This type of change is extremely difficult to justify
# Analysis of Post-Data Preregistration Modifications Without Misconduct

Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, fundamentally contradicts the purpose of preregistration. Let me analyze the likelihood of innocent explanations:

## Purpose of Preregistration

Preregistration exists specifically to:
- Document hypotheses and methods before seeing the data
- Prevent HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)
- Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- Prevent selective reporting based on results

## Possible Innocent Explanations

1. **Administrative Error**:
   - Updating file without realizing implications
   - Uploading wrong version of document
   - Technical issues with timestamp accuracy

2. **Misunderstanding of Preregistration**:
   - Lena might have misunderstood that modifications should be noted as amendments
   - Confusion about proper preregistration procedures
   - Thinking that "cleaning up" the document was acceptable

3. **Documentation of Actual Pre-Data Decisions**:
   - Changes verbally agreed upon before data collection but documented late
   - Modifications discussed with supervisor but not formally recorded until later

## Field-Specific Context

In cognitive neuroscience:
- Preregistration practices are still relatively new in some labs
- Formal training on preregistration procedures is not universal
- Some researchers view preregistration as a flexible document

## Problematic Aspects

Even with benign intentions:
- Changing primary outcomes after data collection violates core scientific principles
- Modifying exclusion criteria post-data is a form of p-hacking, even if unintentional
- The timing creates a fundamental problem regardless of intent

## Conclusion

The modification of preregistration documents after data collection, particularly changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, represents a significant deviation from research integrity standards. While there are some possible innocent explanations related to misunderstanding, administrative error, or poor documentation practices, these explanations are rather weak given the fundamental importance of preregistration timing.

The probability that this would occur without some form of questionable research practice (even if not perceived as "misconduct" by Lena) is quite low.
