  "Based on the evidence provided, Lena is likely under suspicion for academic misconduct due to several concerning factors, such as the suspicious distribution of p-values, modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the exclusion of participants without transparent justification. However, there are also mitigating factors that could suggest innocent explanations, such as technical issues and her previously strong track record.\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation and the evidence at hand, the determination of whether Lena committed academic misconduct would ultimately depend on further investigation, including the context of the decisions made and any additional details not currently revealed. However, the evidence suggests notable concerns that require serious consideration.\n\nThus, I cannot definitively state a \"Yes\" or \"No\". A thorough investigation is necessary to reach an accurate conclusion."
