The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The fact that the notes about the participants' issues predate the journal submission supports the argument that the exclusions were part of a legitimate data cleaning process. Excluding participants who report falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a common and reasonable practice in experimental research, particularly in cognitive neuroscience where participant attention and understanding are crucial for valid data.\n\nGiven that these notes were made in the raw data files before the manuscript submission, this suggests that they were part of the original data processing steps rather than retrospective changes made to manipulate the data to produce better results. This chronological documentation is an important factor in establishing Lena's intent, as pre-existing notes support the notion that exclusions were based on predefined criteria or observations and not on the outcome of the data.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly plausible that these participants were excluded appropriately, as the exclusion is consistent with standard research methodologies and the documentation supports this rationale.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This complexity makes it less straightforward to determine the intent based solely on the presence of notes.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is less plausible that such pre-dating notes would exist in a case of misconduct, their existence cannot be entirely ruled out, as someone committing misconduct might still take steps to make exclusions appear legitimate.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"
