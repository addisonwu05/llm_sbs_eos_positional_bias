The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

One possibility is that these notes serve as a pretext for excluding data points that do not fit the desired outcome, which could have been part of an effort to manipulate the dataset to achieve statistically significant results. \n\nIn this scenario, if Lena deliberately committed misconduct, she might have documented these participant exclusions under credible reasons (e.g., participants falling asleep or not understanding instructions) to provide a cover for data manipulation. The existence of these notes prior to submission might imply that she anticipated scrutiny over her data and preemptively documented exclusions under plausible circumstances. However, the timing of these notes may also have been manipulated to support those exclusions, particularly if Lena had the opportunity to alter timestamps or create retroactive documentation.\n\nThat being said, falsifying pre-submission documentation with the anticipation that it would later provide justification for data exclusions is somewhat elaborate and carries its own risks of detection, especially if other aspects of the research conduct were under scrutiny.
