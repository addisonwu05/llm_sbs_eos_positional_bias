The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Such participants are often removed from analyses to maintain the integrity and validity of the study's findings.

This documentation, along with her previous strong record, supports the assertion that these exclusions were planned and not an attempt to artificially inflate the results' significance.\n\nGiven that the notes predate any journal submission and assuming no other evidence strongly suggests misconduct, it seems quite likely from a procedural standpoint that these exclusions were genuine and not related to misconduct.

In a case of misconduct, it is more likely that notes regarding exclusion might be altered or added later to justify the removal of data points that adversely affect the desired outcome. Predating these notes requires forethought and would suggest planned manipulation from a very early stage of the research, which is less common in typical misconduct scenarios where responses are more opportunistic.\n\nTherefore, if misconduct were involved, the likelihood of there being notes predating the submission that justify these participant exclusions becomes relatively lower compared to if the exclusions were made later in the process to obtain favorable results.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the probability that two participants would be excluded based on pre-existing notes if Lena committed misconduct is moderately low.\n\n30"
