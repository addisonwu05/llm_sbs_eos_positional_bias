The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The fact that her previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" aligns with this characterization.

A positive audit outcome aligns with such a track record.\n\n2. **Consistency**: Researchers who maintain good documentation practices in one project are likely to do so across other projects, given consistent training and personal commitment to research integrity.\n\n3. **Skill and Training**: Lena's ability to handle data and document her work effectively likely results from her training and skills, which are consistent across projects.\n\n4. **Lab Environment**: Being part of a lab with robust standards could contribute to Lena's success in maintaining well-documented and reproducible data. If the lab culture prioritizes such standards, it supports Lena's adherence to those practices.\n\nIn summary, if Lena did not engage in academic misconduct, the likelihood that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit with well-documented and reproducible results is quite high due to her demonstrated skills, track record, and possibly supportive lab environment.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 90"

It is possible for flaws in audits not to catch sophisticated manipulation, though it's less likely if audits are thorough.\n\n3. **Motivations for Misconduct**: If particular pressures or opportunities led Lena to commit misconduct in the current study that were absent in previous studies, it suggests her earlier work was likely free from intentional misconduct.\n\n4. **Risk of Exposure**: Knowing that an audit could catch discrepancies might deter misconduct in earlier studies, leading to genuine practices, especially if the stakes were lower.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, the likelihood that her previous studies—performed under potentially different circumstances—passed an audit due to genuine practices is lower than if she maintained integrity throughout.

Therefore, a software change would occur regardless of Lena’s actions.\n\n2. **Technical Failures**: Hardware failures, such as a hard drive crash, are random events that can happen to any researcher, irrespective of whether they are committing misconduct. The confirmation from IT that the hardware issue was reported and repaired indicates this was a genuine technical problem.\n\n3. **Coincidence Influence**: Even if misconduct occurred, the fact that these events—software change and hardware failure—are documented and not manipulated reduces the likelihood that they are directly related to misconduct.
