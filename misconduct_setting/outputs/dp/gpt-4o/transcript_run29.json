The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions aligns with standard practices to maintain the integrity of the data.\n\n2. **Predating Notes:** The fact that these notes predate the journal submission suggests that Lena identified and recorded these issues as they occurred during the data collection phase. This suggests a systematic approach to handling participant data and not a retroactive justification to manipulate the dataset for favorable results.\n\n3. **Lab Practices and Data Integrity:** Lena has a record of careful data handling, and the lab's switch to new software, as well as technical issues with the hard drive, provide plausible explanations for the current data handling irregularities. Honest recording and exclusion at the time of data entry reflect adherence to ethical research standards.\n\n4. **Avoiding Bias:** It’s less likely that this exclusion was manipulated to achieve significant results if it occurred before any analyses related to journal submission. It indicates that Lena's primary consideration was the study's methodological integrity rather than meeting reviewers' expectations post-submission.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the exclusion of these participants based on initial observations and before any journal submission is a highly probable occurrence.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 85"

Let’s examine the likelihood that exclusion based on notes that predate the journal submission would still occur if misconduct were a factor:\n\n1. **Strategic Manipulation:** If Lena was involved in misconduct, she might strategically plan data manipulation. Excluding participants based on issues like falling asleep or misunderstanding instructions, documented at the time of data collection, could appear typical and not raise immediate red flags.\n\n2. **Forethought in Misconduct:** If misconduct were premeditated, Lena might have deliberately documented reasons for exclusion from the beginning, ensuring that any potential scrutiny related to participant exclusions appears justified and routine.\n\n3. **Preceding Dishonesty:** If transitions in software and technical issues were known, Lena could have used the opportunity to adjust or manipulate findings under the guise of data integrity issues. Maintaining pristine records and notes could be part of an attempt to legitimize unethical adjustments.\n\n4. **Desire to Minimize Scrutiny:** Conducting exclusion procedures with valid annotations from the start would aim to prevent the inquiry from questioning these specific exclusions, rendering them seemingly above board while misconduct occurs in other areas of the data or analysis.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is moderately probable that she would exclude participants who fell asleep or misunderstood instructions and document it to divert suspicion.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 60"

This could enable her to pass audits despite underlying issues.\n\n2. **Selective Misconduct:** It's possible that any misconduct is recent or isolated to particular studies, while earlier work was conducted properly. Thus, previous studies could genuinely reflect her capacity for rigorous research protocols, diluted by pressure or circumstance in later work.\n\n3. **Timing and Learning Curve:** Lena might have learned over time how to better obfuscate any misconduct as audits and scrutiny increased, thus misleading auditors with well-organized but potentially misleading data presentations.\n\n4. **Audit Limitations:** Independent audits, while thorough, can potentially miss subtle fabrications or misconduct, particularly if auditors rely heavily on documentation that appears well-structured and complete without deeper data discrepancies being evident.\n\nOverall, while passing an audit with misconduct involved is less probable than with genuine integrity, it remains plausible if Lena's misconduct was either highly sophisticated or developed recently.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 35"
