The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Software transitions can occur for various reasons, such as improved features, institutional mandates, or cost considerations. Such transitions might lead to discrepancies in data handling or errors.\n\nA hard drive failure is also a known risk, and IT departments routinely handle such incidents. It's feasible that a hard drive failure would result in lost files, especially if backup protocols were not adequately followed or were disrupted. This situation can be further complicated if backups were incomplete or if the transition between software tools led to file mismatches or loss.\n\nThe confluence of switching software and experiencing a hard drive failure, while inconvenient and potentially problematic, is within the realm of possibility in academic settings. If these events are supported by evidence (e.g., IT department records of a repair), this would support Lena’s claim that no misconduct occurred and that any data issues were honest mistakes.\n\nConsidering this context and evidence, while it is unlikely that both these events would occur simultaneously in a typical scenario, it is not impossible. Thus, based on the information provided, the likelihood that these events occurred independently of academic misconduct can be considered moderate to somewhat unlikely.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

Labs might switch software for reasons unrelated to misconduct, such as seeking better functionality or institutional requirements.
