The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "In evaluating the likelihood that the exclusion of two participants was legitimate and not indicative of academic misconduct, we need to consider several factors that may influence this probability:\n\n1. **Documentation of Exclusion Criteria**: If it is a standard practice in Lena's lab to exclude participants who fall asleep or do not understand the instructions, then the exclusion of these two participants aligns with established protocol. The fact that the notes predate any journal submission adds credibility, as they were presumably recorded during or immediately after the data collection phase.\n\n2. **Time-stamped Evidence**: The notes indicating that the participants fell asleep or did not understand are mentioned as predating the journal submission. This suggests contemporaneous documentation, which supports the notion that the exclusions were not retrofitted to improve results after the fact.\n\n3. **Standard Practice in Research**: Participant exclusion based on lack of engagement (e.g., falling asleep) or failure to understand instructions is a common practice in research to ensure data quality. The prior existence of notes suggests this decision was made based on participant behavior rather than experimental outcomes.\n\n4. **Absence of Direct Harm**: Excluding participants who clearly did not engage with the task as intended arguably enhances the integrity of the data rather than compromising it, as long as this process is documented and justified.\n\n5. **Previous Track Record**: Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. While not directly evidential, this background supports her assertion that any issues in the study were unintentional.\n\nGiven these considerations, the presence of pre-dated notes and established justification for exclusion strongly suggest that the act of excluding these data points was consistent with legitimate research practices and not indicative of misconduct. \n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

However, if the notes truly predate the journal submission, it implies these were made before any reviewer feedback and were initially part of the data collection process.\n\n1. **Backdating or Falsification**: To suspect misconduct in this scenario, we would be considering that Lena might have backdated these notes or fabricated them entirely to create a legitimate basis for excluding participants post-criticism or review feedback. However, this would require a deliberate and premeditated act of deception, which is generally riskier and more detectable than other forms of data manipulation.\n\n2. **Opportunity and Motive**: The existence of predated notes means that such a manipulation would have had to occur early in the process, suggesting a preemptive approach to data manipulation. This would connote a sophisticated level of planning inconsistent with most unplanned or pressured instances of misconduct, which often occur later in response to negative results or pressures from reviewers.\n\n3. **Detection Risk**: Given that these notes predate the submission, if there was any system logging or digital timestamp verification (e.g., software tracking changes), the risk of uncovering such premeditated falsification would be high. For someone aware of potential scrutiny, this would represent considerable risk.\n\n4. **Rarity of Method**: While academic misconduct does happen, the specific method of falsifying predated documentation is relatively rare due to its complexity and risk level. Most data manipulations occur in post hoc analyses rather than fabricated initial documentation.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the probability of her having specifically falsified predated notes to exclude participants is relatively low due to the risk and complexity involved.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"

This would require not only modification of data and results but also ensuring the underlying documentation and processes appear lawful.\n\n2. **Variation in Practices**: If the misconduct is specific to the current study and her previous work was conducted without irregularities, then the audits of those projects might accurately reflect her practices at that time.

If the lab deemed it beneficial to switch software during the project, this decision would likely be documented and justified, especially if it aligned with the lab's long-term goals.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: Laptop hard drive failures are not uncommon and can happen randomly due to various factors such as wear and tear, physical damage, or manufacturing defects. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure reported and repaired around that time adds credibility to Lena's claim about the lost files. \n\n3. **Impact on Data Integrity**: While a switch in software and a hard drive failure can complicate data handling, they do not necessarily imply misconduct.

However, the actual occurrences of a software switch and a laptop failure are likely independent of the intent to commit misconduct. Here are some considerations:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: The decision to switch software typically involves the entire lab and not an individual experimenter. Such changes are usually driven by broader organizational requirements or the advantages of using a different tool. Thus, while misconduct might involve exploiting this switch (e.g., to cover manipulations), the actual decision to switch is less likely to be orchestrated solely for misconduct.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: The hard drive failure's confirmation by the IT department provides an objective basis for the event. While someone engaging in misconduct could use this as a cover for missing or altered files, the occurrence of a hardware failure is usually a matter of chance, not manipulation.\n\n3. **Exploiting Circumstances**: If misconduct did occur, these events could be opportunistically cited to explain the absence of certain files or discrepancies in data. However, orchestrating these events deliberately is unlikely, as they hinge on elements like lab policy and technical failures, which are not easily manipulated.\n\nOverall, while these circumstances could be used opportunistically in a misconduct scenario, their initial occurrence remains largely independent of intent, though misconduct might influence how they are portrayed or leveraged.\n\nProbability Judgment: 50"

A researcher intending to commit misconduct might intentionally maintain multiple scripts to use as justification for their chosen analysis path.\n\n2. **Using Lab Norms**: If running multiple analysis scripts with different parameters is a standard procedure within the lab, a person committing misconduct could exploit this established practice to obfuscate deceptive intentions. Inclusion in a routine practice allows suspicious patterns to blend in with legitimate ones.\n\n3. **Adaptation of Genuine Practices**: Even if misconduct occurred, Lena could still be engaging in some genuine practices to fulfill lab requirements. As such, her logs may genuinely reflect a comprehensive, though perhaps misleading, range of analyses consistent with lab norms.\n\n4. **Misconduct amid Norms**: Misconduct can coexist with adherence to some standard practices. The logs showing multiple analysis scripts do not inherently indicate misconduct but can be misused to rationalize or cover manipulative data handling if those intentions existed.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena committed misconduct, the data management logs would likely show her running and storing multiple analysis scripts due to the congruence of these activities with lab norms and the practical utility in concealing unscrupulous actions.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75"

An initial script with more participants, followed by exclusion in the final dataset, might indicate such practices to eliminate data points that reduce the overall significance.\n\n3. **Reconstruction of Research Narrative**: By modifying inclusion criteria after observing the results, a researcher could intentionally align the dataset with the desired outcomes, presenting a coherent but manipulated narrative that misrepresents the actual findings.\n\n4. **Avoiding Negative Effects**: Participants whose data weakens or contradicts the intended outcome could be removed in the final analysis to ensure the narrative aligns with positive, significant findings, thereby aligning with personal or professional pressures.\n\n5. **Post Hoc Clarification**: If misconduct occurred, earlier scripts may be altered to remove data that challenges desired findings, without clear documentation or transparent justification for these changes.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in misconduct, the modification of participant inclusion from initial to final analyses may strongly indicate manipulation intended to achieve specific statistical outcomes.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

Here’s a summary breakdown:\n\n1. **Unusual p-value Clustering**: The dataset shows an atypical concentration of p-values just below .05. This is a common red flag for p-hacking or manipulation unless strong theoretical basis exists to explain it.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: Timestamps show that preregistration was modified post-data collection. Such changes undermine the integrity of preregistration unless fully transparent and justifiable, raising significant concerns.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: An earlier script used more participants than the final dataset. While potentially benign, it might also indicate post hoc data exclusion for achieving desired results.\n\n4. **Internal and External Pressure**: Emails reveal pressures on Lena to achieve significant results. While indicative of a stressful environment, they do not conclusively point to misconduct but provide potential motive.\n\n5. **Institutional and Procedural Norms**: The lab's practices, such as multiple script testing, are common for rigor, but can be exploited for unethical purposes if misused.\n\n6. **Hardware Issues and Software Switch**: These are plausible as technical issues but also provide a mechanism for missing data or explaining inconsistencies.\n\n7. **Prior Performance and Transparency**: Lena previously exhibited a strong track record regarding data integrity in audits, suggesting she understands and can comply with good practices.\n\nConsidering these factors, pieces of evidence show some irregularities aligned with potential misconduct, though not definitively proving such intent. It is likely her research actions could be driven by environmental pressures or misunderstanding rather than malice. However, the accumulative risk patterns and certain actions highlighted cannot be fully discounted.\n\nProbability Judgment: 65"

However, without definitive proof or a conclusive investigation result, it is not possible to provide a certainty.\n\nGiven the context and considering both sides of the evidence, my assessment leans towards an increased likelihood of misconduct, but I cannot definitively say \"Yes\" or \"No\" without further concrete evidence.\n\nTherefore, the response would be: **Uncertain**."
