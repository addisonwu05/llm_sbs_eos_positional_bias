The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Switching software during a research project is not extremely common but can happen for various legitimate reasons. For instance, a new software might offer better features, improved accuracy, or be the preferred option for collaborators or institutional requirements. While this switch might introduce a learning curve or inconsistencies across analyses, it is not inherently suspicious, especially if the switch can be justified by practical or administrative needs. In this case, no specific details are mentioned about why the switch occurred, but the scenario is plausible.\n\nA hard drive failure is a technical issue that can happen unexpectedly, resulting in data loss if backups are not current. The confirmation from the IT department that a hardware failure was reported and repaired adds credence to Lena's explanation. While it's unfortunate timing for such a failure to occur during a critical project phase, especially amid a switch in statistical software, it does not inherently suggest misconduct. Backing up data is a best practice in research, but gaps in this practice are not uncommon, particularly under high stress or when managing large or complex datasets. \n\nWhen combined, these factors present plausible scenarios that lend some support to Lena's claim that any data irregularities are unintentional. The absence or presence of misconduct would depend on further corroborating evidence, patterns of inconsistency, or alternative explanations, rather than the mere occurrence of these two events.\n\nConsidering the information provided, the likelihood that these events happened without any intention of misconduct by Lena seems within the bounds of reasonable possibility based on the typical research environment and known failure rates of hard drives.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 70"

Switching software does not directly indicate misconduct but may be used to obscure or justify discrepancies that arise during data analysis. However, the lab's decision to switch software could also be independent of Lena's actions and motivations, thus it may not directly relate to the misconduct itself.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hardware failure adds a layer of complexity. If Lena engaged in misconduct, a convenient explanation like a hard drive failure coupled with data loss could potentially serve as a cover for missing or altered data. However, she would have to rely on the hardware failure being uncontrollable and verifiable by others. Thus, while a real hardware failure can occur independently of misconduct, its timing might be seen as suspicious in concert with potentially fraudulent actions.\n\nAltogether, the presence of a software switch and hard drive failure alone do not significantly advance the probability of misconduct on Lena's part. However, they might be viewed as potentially providing opportunities to disguise alterations in data. The circumstances might slightly elevate suspicion if seen in conjunction with other evidence pointing towards misconduct, but they can't conclusively indicate intentional wrongdoing by themselves.\n\nGiven these points, the occurrence of these two situations does not significantly change the baseline probability of misconduct happening, but could be perceived slightly more likely if one were already suspicious of fraudulent intent.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 30"

If Lena was committing misconduct, creating documentation to back up these exclusions before submission could be a strategic move to shield against later scrutiny.\n\n2. **Legitimacy of Reasons:** Falling asleep and misunderstanding instructions are generally valid reasons for exclusion, even in the context of misconduct. If Lena were manipulating the data set, she might choose to rely on these commonplace justifications, which are less likely to raise immediate red flags, compared to more arbitrary exclusion criteria.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** If Lena engaged in misconduct, patterns would typically emerge.

    "content": "Assessing the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct requires considering the entirety of the evidence provided:\n\n1. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure:** These could simply be coincidental technical issues, neither strongly indicative of misconduct nor absolving her, but suggestive of potential opportunities.\n\n2. **Participant Exclusion:** The exclusions appear to have been documented prior to any scrutiny, which can be consistent with legitimate practice but also a potential tool if misconduct were intended.\n\n3. **Previous Audit Success:** Her strong record from previous audits suggests a history of integrity but does not preclude recent misconduct under new pressures.\n\n4. **Multiple Scripts and Email Pressure:** Running multiple scripts can be both a sign of robust analysis or an attempt to manipulate outcomes. Emails highlighting pressure indicate motive but not necessarily action.\n\n5. **P-Values and Preregistration Changes:** The clustering of p-values just below .05 and post hoc changes to preregistration are more strongly suggestive of deliberate misconduct, as they reflect common signs of data manipulation aimed at achieving desired outcomes.\n\n6. **Overall Context:** The pressure to produce favorable results and other red flags (e.g., preregistration changes, very favorable p-value distribution) collectively make misconduct more probable.\n\nCombining these factors, while recognizing that definitive conclusions require more direct evidence or admissions, the convergence of suspicious indicators, especially concerning preregistration modification and p-value clustering, increases the likelihood of misconduct.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 80"
