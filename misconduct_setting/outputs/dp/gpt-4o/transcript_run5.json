The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The exclusion of participants who fell asleep or did not understand the instructions seems consistent with standard research practice. In most experimental studies, it's common to exclude participants from the analysis if they did not engage with the task as intended or did not follow instructions, as their data could introduce noise and affect the reliability of conclusions drawn from the study.\n\nThe fact that notes related to the exclusion of these two participants predate the journal submission suggests a level of transparency and consistency in handling data issues. These notes likely serve as contemporaneous documentation of the reasons for exclusion, supporting Lena's assertion that the exclusions were made based on legitimate methodological grounds rather than any attempt at manipulating results.\n\nMoreover, excluding participants due to falling asleep or misunderstanding instructions is not an uncommon occurrence in experimenting with human subjects, especially in complex cognitive tasks. Such exclusions are typically part of the data cleaning process to ensure the quality and integrity of the data analyzed.\n\nThus, the presence of predated notes explaining the rationale for exclusion strengthens the credibility that these actions were part of standard procedure rather than misconduct. While it is not impossible for misconduct to be meticulously covered by predated notes, the presence of the notes makes it more likely that the exclusions were genuine and aligns with typical research protocols.\n\nTaking into account these factors, it seems quite plausible that the exclusion of the two participants was legitimate and not indicative of misconduct. Therefore, the likelihood of these participants being excluded based on the stated notes without any misconduct involved is high.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

However, in this scenario, it's worth considering how this relates to the exclusions based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\nIf Lena intended to manipulate the dataset deliberately, preemptively fabricating notes for excluding participants would require foresight and careful planning to ensure consistency within the documentation. This action would be quite calculating, as it assumes that these specific exclusions would be necessary to achieve the desired results. Moreover, such foresight assumes a level of detailed planning unusual for misconduct, which often seeks opportunistic manipulation of results already collected or in the post-analysis phase.\n\nExcluding participants based on them falling asleep or misunderstanding instructions is plausible as a routine decision for data quality, but for these exclusions to be part of a misconduct strategy, each exclusion would need to directly contribute to artificially creating statistically significant results. It also assumes Lena could predict how excluding these participants would shape the final analysis, which is often not straightforward in complex datasets.\n\nMoreover, involving metadata such as predated notes in misconduct elevates the risk level for the perpetrator due to it being a more traceable form of evidence that could be reviewed, as seen in this inquiry. Thus, while it is theoretically possible for the exclusions to be part of a misconduct strategy, it is relatively less likely compared to other more common methods of data manipulation that do not involve elaborate preemptive documentation.\n\nTherefore, while misconduct could involve strategic exclusions with falsified notes, it is less likely that such predated notes were deliberately planned as part of a misconduct effort, unless Lena anticipated how these two specific exclusions would significantly alter results—which would require a level of precision rarely associated with typical misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

These events can happen independently of any misconduct and often arise due to logistical, technical, or administrative reasons. Let's examine each part:\n\n1. **Switching Software:** Labs might change software due to updated features, better compatibility with other tools, cost considerations, or institutional policy changes. Such transitions can occur mid-project, especially if the benefits of switching outweigh the temporary inconvenience. Additionally, software changes can lead to learning curves or integration issues, which might be reflected in data handling or analysis discrepancies.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure:** Hardware failures, such as a hard drive crash, are not unusual and can happen to anyone, causing data loss if files are not backed up properly. In Lena's case, the fact that IT confirms a report and subsequent repair of the laptop lends credibility to the claim of hardware failure being genuine. This context suggests that any missing files resulting from this event are due to technical issues rather than intentional data manipulation.\n\nTogether, these events could lead to missing data files or inconsistent records without any ill intent. The fact that both occurrences are confirmed—software switch and hardware failure—by independent sources supports the likelihood that these were genuine technical issues rather than orchestrated actions to facilitate misconduct.\n\nOverall, while these events could complicate data handling and analysis, they do not inherently indicate misconduct if viewed in isolation or even in combination. Given the circumstances and third-party confirmation, it's reasonable to conclude that such events could occur without implying academic misconduct by Lena.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it might be hypothesized that she could use events like a software switch or a hardware failure as an opportunity or excuse for missing or altered data. However, let's dissect the likelihood of such events occurring alongside misconduct:\n\n1. **Software Switch:** The decision to change software is usually made at the lab or institutional level based on its perceived benefits. It is not typically within the control of an individual researcher and is therefore less likely to be specifically orchestrated as part of an individual's misconduct strategy. However, a software switch can inadvertently complicate the tracking of analysis changes and serve as a cover for inconsistencies if misconduct were occurring.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure:** While it's theoretically possible for a hardware failure to be used as an explanation for missing or altered data, a hardware malfunction is generally not something one can plan for. The fact that IT has confirmed the report and repair adds a layer of validation that this was a genuine incident. Even if the failure is convenient in the context of misconduct, the action itself (i.e., the loss of data files) would not necessarily have been intentional.\n\nPairing these events with misconduct means seeing them as potential opportunities that were exploited rather than orchestrated. While misconduct could be opportunistic—taking advantage of legitimately occurring events like a hard drive failure—the probability of these independent, externally verified technical issues both being strategically used for misconduct does not inherently increase due to their occurrence.\n\nTaken together, while Lena might theoretically use these events as a convenient narrative if misconduct were at play, the likelihood that she could influence or predict their occurrence specifically to support misconduct remains relatively low. They are more plausibly independent obstacles rather than components of a misconduct plan.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"

If Lena's previous work was consistently honest and thorough, this could be the first instance where misconduct occurred due to a shift in circumstances rather than a longstanding pattern of behavior.\n\n2. **Variable Research Conditions:** Different projects can present varying levels of challenge, incentive, or risk, potentially leading to misconduct in new, high-stakes projects but not in earlier ones. Lena's earlier projects might have been lower stakes or under less scrutiny compared to the current situation.\n\n3. **Meticulous Misconduct:** If misconduct occurred, it's theoretically possible for misconduct to be performed in a way that would also withstand many verification processes, including audits. However, this would require a sophisticated level of manipulation, typically beyond what most misconduct involves.\n\nWhile the presence of well-documented and reproducible work in Lena's past decreases the suspicion of routine unethical behavior, it doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of misconduct arising due to new circumstances. Nevertheless, it would be less likely for someone adept at consistent and thorough documentation to suddenly shift to committing detectable misconduct.\n\nOverall, while misconduct in the current context does not preclude previously verified integrity, the likelihood of maintaining reproducibility and positive ratings in earlier studies even if Lena engaged in recent misconduct remains relatively low.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

This could also serve as a post-hoc justification if challenged.\n\n2. **Lab Culture and Oversight:** The existence of such scripts as part of a lab-wide practice means any misconduct would have to be concealed within normal operations. The pattern of alternative scripts among other students suggests this is a standard practice and not suspicious by itself, making it less likely to draw immediate scrutiny.\n\n3. **Flexibility for Misconduct:** If misconduct were present, maintaining multiple versions of analyses might offer flexibility in choosing results to report.

This process can be part of p-hacking, where data is continually adjusted until significant results are achieved.\n\n3. **Concealing Evidence of Manipulation:** Early versions of scripts show the full dataset, but selectively reporting a subset of participants in the final analysis could conceal evidence of alterations made to improve the appearance of the results.\n\n4. **Altering the Research Narrative:** By altering the list of included participants in the course of analysis, the final dataset reflects a potentially fabricated narrative of data consistency and significance which may not hold with the original, larger dataset.\n\nIn cases of misconduct, modifying which participants are included in the analysis to produce more favorable outcomes is a known strategy. Thus, the likelihood of having earlier scripts with more participants being part of a misconduct strategy is significantly higher.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we can weigh the various factors and evidence provided:\n\n1. **Exclusion of Participants:** The exclusion of participants who fell asleep or misunderstood instructions aligns with standard practices and had predated notes. This suggests a high likelihood of legitimate research protocol rather than misconduct.\n\n2. **Software Switch and Hardware Failure:** The lab's transition to new software and Lena's confirmed laptop failure could plausibly lead to missing files without implying misconduct. These are common issues in research environments and independently confirmed.\n\n3. **Previous Good Record:** Lena's previous work passing an independent audit and being praised for documentation and reproducibility supports a history of integrity, though pressures can change behavior.\n\n4. **Alternative Analysis Scripts:** These were part of standard lab practice for checking robustness, suggesting that running multiple scripts doesn't inherently indicate misconduct.\n\n5. **Expressions of Pressure:** Emails showing pressure to succeed are not uncommon in academic settings and suggest stress more than wrongdoing.\n\n6. **P-Value Distribution:** A skewed distribution of p-values just below .05 is a red flag often associated with p-hacking, which could suggest misconduct if other factors support it.\n\n7. **Preregistration Modifications:** Modifying preregistration documents post-data collection is problematic, especially if it conveniently altered to align with favorable results, suggesting potential misconduct.\n\n8. **Participant Exclusions in Scripts:** Having more participants in earlier scripts but excluding some in the final dataset can indicate misconduct, especially if not transparently justified.\n\nBalancing the evidence, particularly the combination of concerning p-value distributions, post-hoc preregistration changes, and selective participant exclusions, suggests the possibility of misconduct exists despite other factors supporting Lena's credibility. The pressure highlighted in Lena's emails adds a plausible motivation for unethical behavior under stress.\n\nGiven the mixture of legitimate explanations for some findings and significant red flags for others, a moderate likelihood assessment is reasonable.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
