The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This approach aligns with standard practices in scientific research aimed at ensuring the robustness and reliability of findings. Researchers often explore various analytical pathways to understand the impact of their methodological decisions on the outcomes.\n\nThe lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts can be explained by the lab-wide push to explore robustness. In this context, Lena's behavior is consistent with an effort to conduct thorough and responsible research rather than an indication of misconduct. The presence of similar patterns among other students in the lab further supports the notion that this practice is a shared, legitimate method within the group and not unusual.\n\nMoreover, without additional specific evidence of data manipulation or fabrication, the mere presence of multiple analysis scripts is not sufficient to imply misconduct. It is common in scientific environments to assess the robustness of results by considering a range of analytical decisions. Consequently, the existence of these logs does not negate the possibility that Lena's actions were genuine and compliant with ethical research practices.\n\nTherefore, given that the running and storing of multiple analysis scripts aligns with the lab's practices and appears to be a regular strategy for robustness exploration, it is highly likely that this pattern would be observed even if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

Researchers who engage in misconduct might explore various analytical strategies to identify those that produce desirable or significant outcomes, and this can include running numerous scripts with different criteria to find the most favorable results.\n\nIn this scenario, running and storing multiple analysis scripts could also be a tactic to obscure the pathway to a particular set of results, making it difficult to discern which analytical decisions were legitimate versus which were cherry-picked to achieve a certain outcome. It might be an intentional strategy to create a multitude of analysis trails, which complicates the detection of manipulation.\n\nHowever, the fact that this pattern of running multiple scripts is commonplace within the lab as part of robustness checks makes it less conclusive evidence of misconduct on Lena's part specifically. The practice of exploring robustness by considering different exclusion criteria could serve a genuine scientific purpose, even if it also provides potential cover for manipulation. In other words, while such behavior is compatible with misconduct, its presence is not definitive proof of it, and the context of broader lab practices must also be considered.\n\nTherefore, while the existence of multiple alternative analysis scripts is coherent with misconduct, the likelihood that this by itself would definitively indicate misconduct must account for normal lab practices. \n\nProbability judgment: 65"
