The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In this case, her previous work, conducted under different conditions, might still reflect her genuine competence and integrity, leading those earlier projects to pass audits without issue.\n\nHowever, if misconduct were a recurring element in her research practices, it would be rarer for her past studies to withstand the scrutiny of an independent audit and receive high ratings. Deliberate, repeated misconduct often results in more detectable inconsistencies across multiple projects, decreasing the likelihood that all prior work would be rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nNevertheless, research misconduct can sometimes be sophisticatedly concealed, especially if the individual is skilled in data handling, as Lena might be. This could allow previous instances of misconduct to evade detection during audits. However, given the independent audit commented on the quality and reproducibility of her previous work, it suggests those projects genuinely adhered to high standards.\n\nTaking these considerations into account, if Lena did engage in misconduct in her current study, the likelihood of all her previous studies passing an independent audit and being rated positively would still be quite uncertain. However, any recurrent malpractice over time would typically have less chance of remaining completely undetected.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 30"
