The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this scenario is highly probable and entirely consistent with good research practices.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Participant Behavior:** In any study involving human participants, especially one with 80 individuals, it is common for some participants to experience fatigue, distraction, or misunderstanding of instructions. Two participants reporting falling asleep or not understanding the task is not unusual for a study of this size and nature.\n2.  **Exclusion Criteria:** It is standard and ethical practice in research to exclude data from participants whose performance is compromised by factors like falling asleep or not understanding the instructions. Including such data would introduce noise and potentially mask true effects, making the results less reliable. A careful researcher would identify and exclude such unreliable data.\n3.  **Documentation:** Good research practice requires transparent documentation of all data handling decisions, including exclusions. Noting the reasons for exclusion directly in or linked to the raw data files demonstrates transparency and accountability, which are hallmarks of ethical research.\n4.  **Timing of Exclusion:** Decisions about participant exclusion based on real-time observations or self-reports (like \"falling asleep\" or \"not understanding\") are typically made and documented during the data collection and initial data processing phase. This occurs *before* final statistical analyses are performed and certainly *before* a paper is prepared for journal submission. This timing helps prevent post-hoc exclusions driven by a desire to achieve specific results.\n\nGiven that Lena has a \"previously strong record of careful data handling,\" it is highly expected that she would follow these best practices. The exclusion of these two participants, with documented notes predating journal submission, actually serves as an indicator of proper conduct, not misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is an honest researcher, this specific event is not just likely but an expected part of robust data management.\n\n98"

    "content": "Even if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still quite likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Common Occurrence:** Regardless of a researcher's integrity, participants genuinely do fall asleep, get distracted, or misunderstand instructions in experiments. It's a common reality of data collection. So, the *event itself* (two participants having these issues) is plausible in any study.\n2.  **Benefit to Desired Outcome:** If Lena were engaged in misconduct (e.g., falsification to achieve \"clean\" results), excluding genuinely compromised data points (like from someone who was asleep or confused) would typically *improve* the overall data quality and the clarity of the results. This aligns with the goal of someone trying to produce \"perfect\" or statistically significant findings. A dishonest researcher would likely want to remove any data that introduces noise or works against their desired outcome.\n3.  **Mimicry of Good Practice:** A researcher engaging in misconduct might still perform *some* actions that align with good research practice to maintain an appearance of legitimacy and avoid suspicion. Documenting exclusions, especially for very common and justifiable reasons, and doing so in a timely manner (predating submission), is a key aspect of transparent and ethical research. A shrewd individual engaged in misconduct might ensure these aspects are handled correctly to provide a veneer of integrity for their overall work, even if other parts are fabricated or manipulated.\n4.  **Not Mutually Exclusive:** Committing misconduct does not mean a researcher abandons all legitimate practices. It's plausible that Lena genuinely had these two participants whose data was unusable for legitimate reasons, and she excluded them and documented it properly, *while simultaneously* engaging in other forms of misconduct elsewhere in the data analysis or reporting.\n\nTherefore, the exclusion of these two participants for these specific, common reasons, with notes predating submission, does not necessarily rule out misconduct in *other* aspects of the study. It could even be a tactical move to make the overall data handling appear more robust.\n\n80"

It demonstrates a commitment to understanding the limitations and generalizability of one's findings, rather than simply finding a single \"significant\" result.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Policy/Culture:** The statement explicitly mentions a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" If this is a directive or cultural norm within Professor Mills' lab, then Lena, as a diligent student, would be expected to follow this practice. It indicates a systematic approach to data analysis within the research group.\n3.  **Consistency Across Students:** The fact that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" strongly reinforces that this is standard operating procedure for the lab, not a unique or suspicious behavior by Lena. It suggests institutionalized best practices.\n4.  **Transparency and Documentation:** Storing these alternative scripts in data management logs is a positive indicator of transparency and proper documentation. It allows for review and understanding of the analytical choices made, which is crucial for reproducibility and accountability.\n\nIn summary, this scenario describes proactive, transparent, and rigorous data analysis practices that are highly desirable in research.

If Lena were engaged in misconduct to produce \"publishable findings\" and \"clean results\" (e.g., aiming for p=.01), systematically trying different criteria until she found the most favorable outcome would be a highly effective strategy.\n2.  **Mimicking Good Practice/Plausible Deniability:** Even a researcher committing misconduct often tries to maintain an appearance of legitimate scientific practice. The scenario explicitly states there was a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns.\" If this is the norm, Lena would be expected to follow it. Not having multiple scripts would be suspicious. By running and logging these scripts, she creates a paper trail that, on its surface, looks like diligent adherence to lab best practices, providing plausible deniability if questioned about her analytical choices. She could argue she was merely exploring robustness, even if her ultimate decision on which results to report was biased.\n3.  **Nature of the Misconduct:** The misconduct might not be in *running* the scripts, but in *how* she selected which results to report, or in fabricating/falsifying the underlying data *after* discovering what kinds of exclusions or analyses would yield the desired results. Running multiple scripts is a *tool* that can be used for good or ill.\n\nIn essence, whether Lena is honest or dishonest, running multiple scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide push for robustness is a plausible, and in fact, expected behavior in this context. If she committed misconduct, this practice could even serve as the *mechanism* for achieving her desired results (through p-hacking/selective reporting) or as a *cover* for her actions.\n\n95"

    "content": "Even if Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, it is **quite likely** that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Pressure as a Catalyst:** Academic misconduct often arises under immense pressure. The current study is described as \"high-profile\" and Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This unique, high-stakes situation could be the *first time* Lena has felt such extreme pressure, leading her to deviate from her usual ethical standards. If this is the case, her previous clean record is entirely consistent with her being an ethical researcher who, for the first time, succumbed to external pressures.\n2.  **Nature of Misconduct and Audits:** An independent data audit typically verifies that the reported results can be derived from the raw data using the provided scripts, and that documentation is thorough. It focuses on reproducibility and transparency of the *process*. It's possible for a researcher to have well-documented and reproducible processes *while still engaging in misconduct* such as:\n    *   **Selective reporting (p-hacking):** If she only reported analyses that yielded significant results, but the audit checked that *those reported analyses* were reproducible, it wouldn't necessarily catch the unpublished \"failed\" analyses.\n    *   **Subtle data manipulation:** If any fabrication or falsification in previous studies was minor, highly localized, or cleverly disguised to still appear plausible within the documented process, it might not be caught by an audit primarily focused on documentation and reproducibility of the *final reported pathway*.\n    *   **Fabrication of \"raw\" data:** If raw data itself was subtly fabricated, an audit focused on script and documentation might not detect it if the fabricated data looked plausible. However, the rating of \"well-documented and reproducible\" suggests a higher standard.\n3.  **Building a Façade of Credibility:** A researcher intent on misconduct, especially on a high-stakes project, might intentionally maintain an impeccable record on earlier, lower-stakes projects to build a reputation for diligence and integrity. This would serve as a strong defense if later misconduct were ever suspected.\n\nThe most compelling reason is the first point: the current misconduct could be an isolated incident driven by unique pressure. In that scenario, her past good record is genuine and doesn't contradict her current actions.\n\n75"

Switching statistical software can happen for various reasons: new institutional licenses, better features, a shift in analytical trends, or a push for specific functionalities (like the \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" mentioned earlier, which might involve new tools). While not ideal mid-project, it's a realistic logistical change over the multi-year span of a PhD.\n2.  **Hardware Failure is a Fact of Life:** Laptop hard drives, like all hardware, can and do fail. The fact that the IT department *confirms* a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time provides objective, external validation for Lena's account. This isn't a mere claim; it's a verifiable event.\n3.  **Missing Files from Hardware Failure:** A hard drive failure is a prime, entirely legitimate reason for files to be lost or corrupted. Even with diligent backup practices, real-time data loss can occur, or specific versions of files might be unrecoverable if backups weren't perfectly synchronized.\n4.  **\"Mundane Explanations\":** The prompt itself categorizes this as a \"mundane explanation\" for irregularities. If Lena is innocent and honest, these are precisely the types of genuine, external challenges and technical mishaps that would realistically occur in a research project and lead to perceived \"irregularities\" or missing documentation, without any malicious intent.

Hardware failures (like a laptop hard drive crashing) are also random occurrences that can happen to anyone, regardless of their ethical conduct. The IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure further validates this as an objective event.\n2.  **Real-World Complications:** Research projects, especially multi-year PhD projects, are subject to real-world logistical and technical challenges. Software updates, institutional changes, and hardware malfunctions are all common. A dishonest researcher is just as susceptible to these \"mundane explanations\" as an honest one.\n3.  **Convenient Alibi (from the perspective of misconduct):** If Lena *were* engaging in misconduct, the existence of these genuine, verifiable problems (software switch, confirmed hard drive failure, resulting missing files) could be extremely convenient for her. She could potentially leverage these real issues to explain away *other* suspicious patterns, discrepancies, or missing data that are actually related to her misconduct. For example, if she fabricated data, missing original files due to a hard drive crash could provide a plausible reason why those \"originals\" are no longer available for scrutiny.\n\nTherefore, the occurrence of these events is largely independent of Lena's intent.

It is a fact of life that grant funding often depends on promising results, and the career prospects of PhD students (like securing a postdoc) are heavily reliant on publishing significant findings in reputable journals. Lena's assessment of the situation – that her supervisor is under pressure and that a null result would harm her career – is a perfectly realistic and common experience for a third-year PhD student on a high-profile project.\n2.  **Human Desire for Success:** The statement \"I need this one to work\" reflects a natural human desire for one's hard work to yield positive and meaningful results. Researchers spend years on projects, and a sincere hope that their hypotheses will be supported and that their efforts will contribute successfully to science and their career is entirely normal and healthy. It does not inherently imply a willingness to fabricate results, but rather a deep investment in the project's success.\n3.  **Private Communication:** These were emails to a friend, not official communications. People tend to be more candid and express their vulnerabilities, anxieties, and aspirations more freely to friends than in public or professional settings. This makes the emotional and high-stakes tone of the emails particularly believable for an honest individual grappling with immense pressure.\n4.  **Motivation vs. Action:** Feeling extreme pressure and a strong desire for a certain outcome are powerful motivators, but they do not automatically equate to committing misconduct.

Researchers typically start with a larger dataset and progressively refine it by applying exclusion criteria. These criteria might be based on:\n    *   **Pre-defined rules:** Participants failing a comprehension check, falling asleep, or having technical issues (like the two participants already mentioned).\n    *   **Performance thresholds:** For example, participants whose accuracy is at chance level or below a certain threshold, or whose response times are excessively fast or slow.\n    *   **Outlier detection:** Identifying and removing extreme data points that unduly influence results.\n2.  **Developing and Refining Exclusion Criteria:** Sometimes, the precise exclusion criteria are not fully finalized until a researcher has seen some of the data and understood its characteristics. It's common to run initial analyses with looser criteria, then tighten them, or test the robustness of findings with different sets of exclusions. The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" directly supports this, implying that trying various exclusion criteria is standard practice.\n3.  **Snapshot of the Process:** An \"earlier version of the analysis script\" recovered from an automated backup represents a *snapshot* of Lena's work at an earlier stage. At that stage, not all final exclusions might have been applied yet, or the criteria for exclusion might have been different or less strict than what was ultimately decided for the final, reported analysis.\n4.  **Good Documentation:** The existence of such an earlier script in an automated backup is actually indicative of good data management and version control, which aligns with a researcher who has a \"previously strong record of careful data handling.\"\n\nTherefore, for an honest researcher, this scenario is not just plausible but a very common and expected part of a rigorous, iterative data analysis process.\n\n99"

Manipulating participant exclusion criteria is a powerful tool for this.\n    *   If Lena's initial analyses with a larger participant pool didn't yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support\" (p=.01), she might then systematically test different exclusion criteria to see which set of exclusions would produce the most favorable p-value.\n    *   Excluding participants whose data introduces noise or works against the predicted effect is a way to \"clean up\" the data to achieve the desired significant result. The earlier script would then represent a version *before* these selective exclusions were finalized.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Rigor:** Even if engaged in misconduct, a researcher often tries to make their process *appear* legitimate and rigorous. Having multiple scripts, including those with different exclusion criteria, could be presented as evidence of thoroughly exploring the data and testing robustness, even if the final selection of criteria was driven by the desired outcome rather than purely objective scientific reasoning. This aligns with the \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" mentioned previously.\n3.  **Iterative Process as a Cover:** The data analysis process is naturally iterative. An individual committing misconduct can exploit this iterative nature by using each iteration to move closer to their desired result, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate refinement from malicious manipulation.\n4.  **Misconduct in Other Areas:** Even if the *decision* to exclude these participants was legitimate (e.g., they genuinely fell asleep or didn't understand), the misconduct could lie in other areas, such as fabricating other data points or altering the primary outcome variables. In this case, the iterative nature of exclusions would still be present.\n\nTherefore, the existence of an earlier script with more participants, later excluded, is highly consistent with a scenario of misconduct, as it provides a plausible mechanism for achieving desired results through selective data handling.\n\n95"

If there are true effects, the distribution would lean towards smaller p-values, but there would still be a natural spread, including values just above a conventional threshold like .05.\n2.  **Hallmark of P-Hacking:** The described pattern – a \"cliff\" effect where p-values cluster just below a significance threshold and are conspicuously absent just above it – is a widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It suggests that researchers may have run multiple analyses, stopped when they found a significant result, or adjusted analyses (e.g., exclusions, covariates, transformations) until they pushed a borderline non-significant result across the .05 threshold.\n3.  **\"Unusually high concentration\" and \"almost no\":** The phrasing in the prompt emphasizes that this is not a random occurrence. If it were a genuine outcome of unbiased exploration, one would expect a more even distribution around .05, with some results falling just above and some just below, reflecting the natural variability of data.\n4.  **No Mechanism for Natural Occurrence:** There is no known statistical or scientific principle that would naturally cause p-values to cluster just below an arbitrary threshold like .05 and disappear above it, in the absence of intentional manipulation or selective reporting.\n\nWhile extremely rare statistical flukes can happen, the strong and systematic nature of this pattern across \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it highly improbable to occur by chance if all analyses were conducted and reported without bias or manipulation.\n\n5"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **extremely likely** that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Hallmark of P-Hacking/Selective Reporting:** This specific pattern of p-values (a \"cliff\" at the .05 threshold) is widely recognized in statistical forensics as a strong indicator, or even a direct consequence, of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. These are forms of academic misconduct where researchers make analytical choices (consciously or unconsciously, but in the context of misconduct, intentionally) to achieve statistical significance.\n2.  **Achieving Desired Results:** Given the intense pressure Lena was under (\"supervisor counting on this study,\" \"null result would kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"), and the goal of producing \"strong, statistically significant support\" and \"clean results,\" a common strategy for misconduct would be to manipulate analyses until p-values cross the arbitrary .05 significance threshold. This would naturally lead to a cluster of values just below .05 and a scarcity of values just above, as non-significant results would either be discarded, re-analyzed with different parameters, or otherwise suppressed.\n3.  **Mechanism of Misconduct:** The misconduct itself could *be* the process of trying various analytical pathways (e.g., different exclusion criteria as discussed, different covariates, data transformations) until a result that passes the significance threshold is found. If this is the case, the resulting p-value distribution is a direct fingerprint of that misconduct.\n4.  **Targeting the \"Publishable\" Threshold:** The .05 threshold is often the primary gatekeeper for publishability in many fields. A researcher motivated by pressure to publish would explicitly target getting results below this threshold.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in misconduct aimed at securing statistically significant results, this p-value distribution is precisely what one would expect to see as a direct outcome of her actions.\n\n99"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is **extremely unlikely** that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some of the planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Purpose of Preregistration:** Preregistration is a core component of open science practices designed specifically to prevent questionable research practices like p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). Its entire purpose is to set a public, unchangeable plan *before* data collection and analysis, thus committing researchers to their stated hypotheses, methods, and analyses.\n2.  **Violation of Good Practice:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection, especially to alter fundamental elements like primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, fundamentally undermines the integrity and purpose of preregistration. It makes the preregistration itself meaningless as a guard against bias.\n3.  **Appearance of Misconduct:** This action is one of the clearest \"red flags\" for academic misconduct. It creates the strong suspicion that the plan was changed to fit observed data, ensuring significant results or \"clean\" findings. Even if the researcher's intent was not malicious, the action itself makes it appear indistinguishable from p-hacking or HARKing.\n4.  **Proper Procedure for Changes:** If unforeseen issues arise during data collection or initial data inspection that genuinely necessitate a change in the analysis plan (e.g., a planned measure failed, an exclusion criterion was unfeasible), the accepted practice is to add an *addendum* or amendment to the preregistration, clearly documenting the original plan, the reason for the change, and the new plan. Modifying the original document without a transparent record of the change is not considered good practice.\n\nWhile a genuine, honest mistake in the initial preregistration might be corrected, changing *primary outcomes* and *exclusion criteria* after data collection is a substantial alteration that directly compromises the transparency and anti-bias goals of preregistration. An honest researcher committed to transparent science would be highly unlikely to take such an action, as it fundamentally contradicts ethical research practices in the modern scientific landscape.\n\n1"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **extremely likely** that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Direct Mechanism for P-Hacking/HARKing:** Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria is a classic and direct form of questionable research practice, often falling under the umbrella of p-hacking or HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). If Lena's initial planned analyses or outcomes didn't yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support\" she needed, changing these elements post-hoc would allow her to:\n    *   **Select a significant outcome:** If the originally planned primary outcome wasn't significant, she could redefine a different, significant outcome from the collected data as the \"primary\" one.\n    *   **Optimize for significance:** By changing exclusion criteria, she could manipulate the participant pool to achieve a statistically significant result from the remaining data.\n2.  **Pressure and \"Needs\":** Lena's expressed pressure (\"supervisor counting on this study,\" \"null result would kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") provides a powerful motivation for such an action. If the initial plan didn't \"work,\" altering the plan to make it work would be a logical step for someone under such pressure and committing misconduct.\n3.  **Attempt to Cover Tracks:** While this action is a significant red flag, a researcher engaging in misconduct might still attempt to make their post-hoc decisions *appear* to be pre-planned by altering the preregistration document itself. This is an attempt to legitimize results that were actually found through data-driven exploration aimed at significance.\n\nIn summary, if Lena committed misconduct, this specific action—modifying the preregistration post-data collection to alter primary outcomes and exclusion criteria—is not just consistent with misconduct, but is a direct manifestation of how such misconduct often occurs to produce desired results.\n\n99"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct appears very high.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence and its implications:\n\n**Evidence Weighing Towards Misconduct (or strongly suggestive of it):**\n\n1.  **Unusual p-value distribution (E7):** An \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. This is an extremely strong indicator of manipulation designed to achieve statistically significant results. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this pattern is highly improbable (our judgment: 5%). If she did, it's extremely likely (our judgment: 99%). This is a critical piece of evidence.\n2.  **Post-data collection modification of preregistration (E8):** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection, specifically to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration. This is a clear red flag for HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) or tailoring the plan to fit observed data. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this is extremely unlikely (our judgment: 1%). If she did, it's extremely likely (our judgment: 99%). This is arguably the most damning piece of procedural evidence.\n3.  **Emails expressing extreme pressure (E5):** Lena's emails (\"supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") reveal significant pressure and a strong motivation to achieve positive results. While these feelings don't *prove* misconduct, they provide a very clear and plausible motive for it. This evidence is equally likely under both hypotheses (our judgment: 98% for both), meaning it doesn't discriminate, but it explains *why* misconduct might occur.\n4.  **Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria (E6):** While this can be good practice, it also serves as a mechanism for p-hacking (trying different criteria until a significant result is found). The later modification of preregistration regarding exclusion criteria could be directly linked to this. It's likely under both scenarios (99% for no misconduct, 95% for misconduct).\n\n**Evidence Weighing Against Misconduct (or offering \"mundane explanations\"):**\n\n1.  **Exclusion of two participants with clear notes (E1):** This is consistent with good practice and is highly likely even if she committed misconduct. It doesn't strongly discriminate.\n2.  **Lab-wide push for robustness (E2):** This explains why she'd run multiple scripts and could provide plausible deniability, but doesn't rule out that the *selection* of which results to report was biased. It's highly likely under both scenarios.\n3.  **No prior record of data irregularities, passed audit (E3):** This is strong evidence of prior good conduct. However, misconduct can be an isolated incident, particularly under unprecedented pressure. This is less likely if she committed misconduct (our judgment: 75%) than if she didn't (99%), but it doesn't make misconduct impossible, especially given the new high-stakes environment.\n4.  **Software switch and hard drive failure (E4):** These are genuine technical issues that could explain missing files and irregularities without malice. The IT confirmation supports this. They are highly likely under both scenarios.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a prior good record and faces genuine technical and logistical challenges, the presence of two extremely strong indicators of misconduct (the p-value distribution and the post-data collection modification of preregistration) is highly compelling. These are not \"mundane explanations\" but rather direct consequences or mechanisms of manipulating research outcomes. The high pressure Lena was under provides a clear motive for departing from her previously strong record.\n\nThe statistical pattern of p-values and the alteration of the preregistration document are particularly difficult to explain away as honest mistakes or coincidences, especially when they appear together. These pieces of evidence strongly override the \"mundane explanations\" for other irregularities.\n\n97"
