The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we are evaluating the likelihood of two independent events occurring naturally during her PhD project:\n\n1.  **The lab switching statistical software halfway through the project:** This is a plausible event in an academic lab. Research environments are dynamic; PIs might decide to adopt new tools (e.g., switching from proprietary software to open-source R or Python), new versions of software might offer superior features, or new lab members might bring expertise in a different package. While not every project experiences a software switch, it's far from an uncommon occurrence over a multi-year PhD, especially if a lab is seeking to optimize its workflows or adapt to new methodologies.\n2.  **Lena's laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files:** Hard drive failures are a known and unfortunate reality of computing. Even with modern reliability, they do happen, especially on devices used intensively for several years. The crucial detail here is that the IT department *confirms* the hardware failure and repair. This turns it from a mere claim into a verifiable fact. Losing files due to such a failure is a direct and plausible consequence, particularly if backup protocols were not perfectly robust or if recent work hadn't been fully backed up before the failure.\n\n**Co-occurrence:**\nThese two events are independent of each other; a software switch does not cause a hard drive failure, and vice versa. However, the question asks about the likelihood of *both* happening during the same project, assuming Lena's innocence.\n\nGiven that both events are individually plausible in a typical research setting over a multi-year period, their co-occurrence, while perhaps not *frequent*, is certainly not impossible or extraordinarily rare. The case description itself refers to them as \"mundane explanations,\" suggesting they are considered within the normal range of technical difficulties and operational changes that can affect research projects. The IT confirmation of the hard drive failure lends significant credibility to that event.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is not committing misconduct, these are simply unfortunate, but genuine, circumstances that would naturally complicate data management and analysis history. They are not so rare that their co-occurrence points inherently to suspicion, especially given the \"mundane explanations\" context.\n\nConsidering the individual probabilities of such events and the fact that they are unrelated:\n\n*   A significant software switch in a lab during a multi-year project could happen in perhaps 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 projects.\n*   A confirmed hard drive failure on a primary research laptop leading to some data loss, even with backups, might occur in perhaps 1 in 10 or 1 in 15 researchers over a 3-year period.\n\nMultiplying these estimated probabilities (e.g., 0.20 * 0.08 = 0.016 or 1.6%) would suggest a very low statistical probability. However, the qualitative judgment requested (\"how likely\") and the context of \"mundane explanations\" imply a higher perceived plausibility than a strict statistical calculation might yield. These are common sources of real-world complexity in research. Their co-occurrence would be uncommon, but not so rare as to be immediately dismissed as an unlikely fabrication if Lena were innocent.\n\nA probability around 20% (1 in 5 chance) reflects that it's not highly common for both to occur, but it's also not shockingly rare, fitting the description of \"mundane explanations\" for irregularities that might arise when data trails are messy.\n\n20"

It's a plausible, albeit not daily, event in an academic lab over a multi-year project.\n2.  **Confirmed hard drive failure:** This is a hardware malfunction, an objective technical event that the IT department independently confirmed. A researcher's ethical behavior or lack thereof has no causal relationship with the physical failure of a hard drive.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, these two events would still be genuine, independent occurrences in the course of her work. She might then *exploit* these genuine circumstances (the software switch causing confusion, the hard drive failure explaining missing files) to cover up her misconduct or explain away irregularities. However, her misconduct would not *cause* these events to happen, nor would these events become more or less likely to occur simply because she was engaged in misconduct.

This is an accepted reality of working with human subjects.\n2.  **Exclusion is standard practice:** When a participant's data is compromised due to these issues (e.g., they weren't paying attention, didn't understand what to do), their data becomes invalid for testing the experimental hypothesis. Excluding such participants is not only common but also considered good methodological practice to maintain data quality and the integrity of the findings. Including such data would introduce noise or bias.\n3.  **Documentation in raw data files:** Documenting the reasons for exclusion directly in the raw data files or an associated log is excellent practice. It provides a transparent audit trail for decisions made during data processing.\n4.  **Notes predating submission:** The fact that these notes predate any journal submission is a critical detail. It indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made based on objective criteria observed during data collection/initial processing, *before* the study's results were finalized or external pressure for publication mounted. This strongly suggests that the exclusions were legitimate methodological decisions rather than post-hoc attempts to manipulate results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, then this set of events represents careful, ethical, and standard data handling.

If a researcher is attempting to achieve statistically significant results for a predetermined theory or to avoid a null result, they can adjust these parameters until a favorable outcome is found. Retroactively altering the preregistration document would make these post-hoc decisions appear as if they were part of the original, unbiased plan.\n2.  **Consistency with Pressure:** Given the immense pressure Lena was under (supervisor's grant, her postdoc chances, \"I need this one to work\"), and the reported \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05\" (a strong indicator of p-hacking), such modifications to the preregistration would be a logical step to legitimize findings achieved through questionable means.\n3.  **Cover-up:** If misconduct involving data manipulation or selective analysis has occurred, then altering the preregistration document serves as a way to create an \"official\" paper trail that aligns with the desired (and potentially manipulated) outcomes, thereby attempting to cover up the misconduct by making it appear as if the analysis plan was always consistent with the published results.\n\nTherefore, this action is not merely consistent with misconduct, but it is a very probable method or consequence of a researcher engaging in such practices.\n\n95"

    "content": "Let's weigh the evidence based on the likelihood judgments provided:\n\n**Evidence pointing towards Academic Misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, almost none above:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 10%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 95%\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a strong statistical indicator of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. It's highly unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2.  **Preregistration document modified *after* data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 5%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 95%\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a severe breach of research ethics and scientific integrity. The purpose of preregistration is to prevent post-hoc changes. Modifying it afterward to alter key aspects of the analysis plan is a direct method of legitimizing potentially manipulated or selectively reported results (HARKing, p-hacking).\n\n3.  **Emails to a friend expressing intense pressure and desire for a positive result (\"I need this one to work,\" supervisor counting on grant, null result hurts postdoc chances):**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 90%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 90%\n    *   **Interpretation:** While common anxieties, these emails clearly establish a strong motive for misconduct. They don't prove misconduct, but they provide a plausible context for *why* it might occur.\n\n4.  **Earlier analysis script with *more* participants than the final dataset:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 85%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 90%\n    *   **Interpretation:** While often part of normal iterative data cleaning, it can also be a mechanism for p-hacking (selectively removing participants to achieve significance). Combined with the p-value distribution and preregistration changes, this becomes more suspicious as a potential method.\n\n**Evidence consistent with Lena's Innocence or Neutral Evidence:**\n\n1.  **Lena has no prior record of data irregularities, previous studies passed independent audit and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible\":**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 98%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 95%\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is the strongest piece of evidence in Lena's favor, suggesting a history of good practice. However, it doesn't preclude a first-time misconduct driven by extreme pressure.\n\n2.  **Lab's data management logs show Lena running multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 95%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 90%\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a legitimate practice. While it *could* be exploited for p-hacking, the \"lab-wide push\" and \"similar to other students\" aspects suggest it's a standard and transparent procedure within the lab. It helps explain the existence of multiple scripts without necessarily implying misconduct.\n\n3.  **Lab switched software mid-project; Lena's laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to missing files:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 20%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 20%\n    *   **Interpretation:** These are \"mundane explanations\" for irregularities or missing files. They are plausible events independent of guilt and could be used to explain away issues, but they don't inherently point to misconduct or innocence regarding the data itself.\n\n4.  **Two participants excluded (fell asleep/didn't understand) based on notes predating journal submission:**\n    *   Likelihood if Innocent: 95%\n    *   Likelihood if Guilty: 95%\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is entirely normal and good research practice, providing no indication of misconduct.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe evidence provides a mixed picture, but some elements are far more damning than others.\n\n*   The **p-value distribution** and the **post-hoc modification of the preregistration document** are critically important. These are widely recognized signs of academic misconduct and are extremely difficult to explain as \"honest mistakes\" or \"mundane occurrences\" if Lena is truly innocent. Their low likelihood under the \"innocent\" hypothesis (10% and 5%) stands in stark contrast to their high likelihood under the \"guilty\" hypothesis (95% for both).\n*   The **emails** provide a strong, explicit motive, which aligns with why a researcher with a previously clean record might commit misconduct under severe pressure.\n*   The fact that earlier analysis scripts contained more participants provides a plausible mechanism for how the results might have been optimized through selective exclusion, reinforcing the suspicion from the p-value distribution and preregistration changes.\n*   Lena's **strong prior record** is significant counter-evidence, suggesting this behavior would be out of character. However, it is possible for individuals, even those with excellent track records, to succumb to intense pressure.\n*   The other pieces of evidence (software switch, hard drive failure, routine participant exclusions, general lab-wide robustness checks) are largely neutral or can be explained by both scenarios, sometimes serving as convenient elements for a cover-up if misconduct occurred.\n\nWhen combining the extremely low probability of the p-value distribution and preregistration modification occurring if Lena were innocent with the high probability of these events if she were guilty, alongside a strong motive, the weight of evidence points strongly towards academic misconduct. While her past record offers some doubt, the nature of the specific irregularities is very difficult to reconcile with unintentional error.\n\n90"
