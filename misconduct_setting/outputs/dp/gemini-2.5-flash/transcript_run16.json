The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Good research practices include:\n\n1.  **Identifying problematic participant data:** It is common for some participants in a study to have issues such as falling asleep or not understanding instructions, which can compromise the validity of their data.\n2.  **Documenting these issues:** A diligent researcher would typically record notes about such occurrences in the raw data files or associated logs.\n3.  **Making informed decisions about data inclusion/exclusion:** Based on these documented issues, a researcher would make a decision about whether to include or exclude the problematic data. Excluding data from participants who did not perform the task correctly (e.g., due to sleep or misunderstanding) is a standard and often necessary practice to maintain the quality and interpretability of the dataset.\n4.  **Making these decisions prior to final analysis and submission:** These decisions about data cleaning and exclusion are typically made during the data processing phase, well before the final manuscript is prepared and submitted to a journal. This ensures that the analytical pipeline is robust and not influenced by post-hoc attempts to achieve desired results.\n\nThe scenario described—two participants excluded due to legitimate issues (falling asleep, not understanding instructions), with these exclusions documented in notes that predate journal submission—perfectly aligns with responsible and ethical data handling.

The fact that two participants genuinely reported issues provides a perfect, defensible reason for exclusion that would align with her goal of having a \"clean\" dataset, regardless of whether other data manipulation occurred.\n\nIn essence, a researcher committing misconduct would likely still perform or simulate standard data cleaning procedures, including exclusions for valid reasons, to provide a veneer of legitimacy and make their fraudulent work harder to detect.\n\n80"

The described scenario aligns perfectly with principles of good scientific practice and transparency:\n\n1.  **Exploring Robustness:** Running multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria (stricter vs. looser) is a standard and highly recommended practice in modern research. It demonstrates an effort to test the robustness of findings and ensure that the conclusions are not dependent on a single, potentially arbitrary, set of analytical choices. This practice helps to guard against \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting by showing the range of potential outcomes under different reasonable assumptions.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Policy:** The fact that this is explicitly described as \"a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" indicates that it's an encouraged and institutionalized practice within Professor Mills' lab. If a lab actively promotes such rigor, an ethical and competent PhD student like Lena would be expected to follow these guidelines.\n3.  **Consistency with Peers:** The observation that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" further reinforces that this is a normal and expected part of the lab's research culture. If Lena is not committing misconduct, she would be adhering to these established lab practices.\n4.  **Transparency and Due Diligence:** Storing these alternative scripts in data management logs, rather than hiding them, demonstrates transparency. It shows that Lena was systematically exploring her data, which is a sign of careful and thorough research.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is an honest researcher, this scenario is not only likely but almost *expected* in a lab that emphasizes rigor and robustness.\n\n98"

Here's why:\n\n1.  **Conforming to Lab Culture and Expectations:** The scenario explicitly states this is a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns.\" If Lena were committing misconduct, she would still be operating within this established lab environment. Not following this lab-wide practice would be a significant anomaly and could itself raise suspicion, making her stand out. To blend in and avoid detection, she would likely mimic the accepted practices of the lab.\n\n2.  **Plausible Deniability and Cover-up:** A researcher engaging in misconduct, especially one under pressure and potentially anticipating scrutiny, would likely try to create a paper trail that appears legitimate. Running and storing multiple scripts, even if she ultimately selected or manipulated results from one specific script, provides a veneer of thoroughness and adherence to good practice. If questioned, she could point to these scripts as evidence of her robust exploration, deflecting accusations of selective analysis.\n\n3.  **Facilitating Misconduct (e.g., P-hacking):** If the misconduct involved \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting (e.g., trying different analytical choices until a significant result is found), running multiple analysis scripts with varying criteria is precisely the mechanism through which such misconduct occurs. She might genuinely run many, find the one that yields the desired \"publishable findings,\" and then focus on that specific analysis, potentially further tweaking data within it or simply failing to report the others.\n\n4.  **Before Misconduct:** It's also possible that Lena began her work following good scientific practice, running various scripts as per lab policy. If she then failed to find the desired results through honest means, she might then resort to misconduct (e.g., fabricating or falsifying data within one of those scripts, or selectively choosing one that \"worked\") while still having the history of running multiple scripts.\n\nIn summary, the existence of these logs would either be a genuine reflection of her adherence to lab policy (even if other misconduct occurred), or a deliberate act to create a misleading impression of rigor and transparency to cover up her actions. In either case, it's highly probable.\n\n90"

It allows a researcher to retroactively adjust their plan to match favorable results found during data analysis (e.g., p-hacking, HARKing - Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n2.  **Pressure to Produce Publishable Findings:** The scenario states that Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review\" and Lena's paper \"reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results.\" If the initial, preregistered plan did not yield these desired results, a researcher committing misconduct would be strongly incentivized to change the plan to align with analyses that *did* produce significance.\n3.  **Cover-Up and Legitimacy:** Altering the preregistration document itself (rather than transparently reporting deviations) is a deliberate act to make post-hoc analyses or selective reporting appear as if they were planned from the outset.

This is a common and often necessary part of the research process for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Iterative Data Cleaning and Refinement:** Data analysis is rarely a single, linear pass. Researchers often start with a broad dataset and then progressively refine their exclusion criteria as they gain a deeper understanding of the data, participant behavior, and potential confounds. An initial script might be a preliminary pass, while later versions incorporate more stringent or nuanced rules for data quality.\n2.  **Developing and Testing Exclusion Criteria:** Deciding on appropriate exclusion criteria (e.g., based on performance accuracy, response times, adherence to instructions, outlier detection) is an analytical step that often evolves. Researchers might test different thresholds or criteria and then settle on the most scientifically justified set for their final analyses.\n3.  **Identifying Issues Post-Collection:** Some participant issues (e.g., specific patterns of non-compliance, technical glitches affecting only certain sessions, or extreme outliers) might only become apparent after initial data processing or preliminary analyses, leading to retrospective exclusion.\n4.  **Robustness Checks:** As mentioned in an earlier scenario, labs often encourage exploring different exclusion criteria to test the robustness of findings. An earlier script might reflect a looser criterion, while the final dataset uses a stricter one (or vice versa, depending on what is deemed most appropriate).\n5.  **Normal Version Control:** Researchers constantly create and modify scripts, and saving different versions (especially with automated backups) is good practice.

Here's why:\n\n1.  **Mechanism for P-hacking/Selective Reporting:** A common form of academic misconduct, or questionable research practice (QRP), is to selectively exclude participants or data points until a statistically significant or \"clean\" result is obtained. If Lena was under pressure to produce \"publishable findings\" and her initial analyses with a full dataset didn't yield the desired p = .01, she would be strongly incentivized to experiment with different exclusion criteria. An earlier script might represent one of these initial attempts with a broader dataset, before the \"optimal\" exclusions were identified and applied.\n2.  **Iterative Data Manipulation:** The process of finding the \"perfect\" results often involves an iterative approach to data cleaning and analysis. This would naturally lead to multiple versions of scripts, with earlier versions potentially including participants who were later removed as Lena refined her exclusions to achieve the desired outcomes.\n3.  **Exploiting Ambiguity in Exclusion Criteria:** Even with pre-registered criteria, there can be some subjective judgment in their application (e.g., how to define an \"outlier,\" what constitutes \"not understanding instructions\" beyond explicit reports). A researcher committing misconduct might exploit this ambiguity to exclude participants whose data weaken the desired effect.\n4.  **Cover-Up/Plausible Deniability:** The existence of earlier scripts with more participants could even be used by a researcher committing misconduct as a defense. They could argue it shows a diligent process of data cleaning and refinement, even if the final exclusion decisions were driven by a desire for significance rather than pure scientific merit.\n\nGiven that the inquiry is into \"fabrication or falsification of data,\" and the whistleblower claims \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments,\" it is highly consistent with Lena having explored different datasets (via exclusion) to achieve her results.\n\n90"

If there are true effects, p-values would generally be smaller, but there would be a more even distribution around the threshold. Some analyses would naturally yield p-values like .06, .07, or .08, which are just above the conventional significance level, even if the underlying effect is real but weak, or if there's noise in the data.\n2.  **Statistical Improbability:** For multiple exploratory analyses to coincidentally yield p-values like .041, .047, and .049, with almost no corresponding values like .051, .053, or .059, would be an extraordinary statistical coincidence. The probability of obtaining a p-value between 0.04 and 0.05 is the same as obtaining one between 0.05 and 0.06, assuming a continuous distribution. An \"unusually high concentration\" just below .05 combined with \"almost no\" just above .05 strongly suggests selective reporting or analytical choices made to push values across the significance threshold.\n3.  **Exploratory Analyses:** This pattern is particularly suspicious for \"exploratory analyses.\" While primary outcomes might be expected to be significant if the theory is robust, exploratory analyses are, by definition, less constrained and more prone to yielding a wider range of results. A natural distribution for exploratory analyses would typically include many non-significant findings.\n\nThis specific pattern of p-values is a classic indicator of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct.

P-hacking refers to the practice of performing multiple statistical tests and then only reporting those that yield significant results (typically p < .05). Researchers might try various analyses, exclusion criteria, or data transformations until they push a p-value across the .05 threshold.\n2.  **Pressure for Significance:** The scenario explicitly states that Lena's supervisor \"Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings\" and the initial paper \"reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results.\" This pressure provides a strong motivation for a researcher engaging in misconduct to manipulate results to achieve significance.\n3.  **Hiding Non-Significant Results:** If an analysis yields a p-value just above .05 (e.g., .051, .059), a researcher committing misconduct might either not report it, or continue to manipulate the data/analysis until that p-value drops below .05.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would write emails expressing these sentiments.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Ubiquitous Academic Pressure:** PhD students, especially those working on \"high-profile\" projects, frequently face immense pressure to produce significant, publishable results. This pressure often comes from their supervisors, funding bodies, and the competitive academic job market.\n2.  **Supervisor's Grant Review:** The scenario explicitly states Professor Mills \"is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" Lena's study is central to this. It's perfectly natural for Lena to be acutely aware of this and feel the weight of her supervisor's reliance on her work.\n3.  **Career Implications:** A successful publication, particularly from a \"high-profile experiment,\" is often critical for a PhD student's career progression, including securing a postdoctoral position. Conversely, a \"null result\" (a failure to find predicted effects) in such a key study could indeed be perceived as a significant setback for postdoc chances. This is a realistic concern in academia.\n4.  **Expression to a Friend:** Emails to a friend are a private space where one is likely to express genuine anxieties, hopes, and the stress associated with their work. Expressing a strong desire for success (\"I need this one to work\") is a human reaction to high-stakes situations and reflects motivation, not necessarily an intent to defraud.\n\nThese emails simply reflect the real-world pressures and anxieties common to many PhD students, regardless of whether they ultimately commit misconduct. An honest Lena would still feel and articulate these pressures.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would write emails expressing these sentiments.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The emails describe precisely the kind of intense pressure and high stakes that often *motivate* academic misconduct. If Lena felt her supervisor's grant and her own career prospects (postdoc chances) were hanging in the balance, and she had a desperate personal need for the study to succeed (\"I need this one to work\"), these pressures could easily push her to unethical behavior when the honest path didn't yield desired results.\n2.  **Relief of Pressure:** Committing misconduct (e.g., p-hacking, fabricating data) would be a direct, albeit unethical, way to alleviate the very pressures articulated in these emails. By ensuring \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory,\" she would be \"saving the grant\" and securing her \"postdoc chances.\"\n3.  **Human Reaction:** These are genuine expressions of stress and ambition that many PhD students experience. A person experiencing such stress and then succumbing to misconduct would be consistent with their internal state as revealed in these private communications. The emails reveal her internal motivation and the external pressures she was feeling, making her subsequent misconduct (if it occurred) understandable within that context.\n\nTherefore, the existence of these emails would be entirely consistent with, and indeed explanatory of, a decision to commit academic misconduct.\n\n97"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence:\n\n**Evidence strongly pointing towards academic misconduct:**\n\n*   **Preregistration modified after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (timestamped):** This is a critical piece of evidence. Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection to change the plan is considered a direct violation of research integrity and a form of misconduct itself. An innocent researcher would transparently report deviations, not retroactively alter the official plan. The probability of this occurring if Lena did not commit misconduct was assessed as 1%. The probability if she did commit misconduct was assessed as 95%. This is a strong indicator.\n*   **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and almost no p-values just above .05 for exploratory analyses:** This is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, a form of academic misconduct. Such a distribution is highly improbable by chance in exploratory analyses. The probability of this occurring if Lena did not commit misconduct was assessed as 5%. The probability if she did commit misconduct was assessed as 98%. This is another very strong indicator.\n*   **Emails revealing high pressure and personal stakes:** Lena's emails express intense pressure from her supervisor regarding the grant review and a personal \"need\" for the study to succeed for her postdoc chances. While these sentiments are common, they provide a very clear and strong *motive* for committing misconduct if she struggled to achieve the desired results honestly. The probability was high for both scenarios (95% if innocent, 97% if guilty), meaning it doesn't distinguish guilt/innocence itself but explains the 'why'.\n*   **Whistleblower claim:** The anonymous claim that data \"look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments\" directly aligns with the types of misconduct suggested by the p-value distribution and the preregistration modification.\n\n**Evidence that is neutral or could be explained by either scenario:**\n\n*   **Exclusion of two participants (sleep/misunderstanding) with notes predating submission:** This is standard good practice and would be expected from an honest researcher (95%). However, a researcher committing misconduct might also perform these legitimate exclusions to make the data look more realistic or to strategically remove noisy data points (80%). This piece of evidence is largely neutral.\n*   **Multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, common in the lab:** This is also good practice for exploring robustness (98%). However, it could also be the mechanism through which p-hacking occurs, trying different analytical paths until significance is achieved (90%). This is largely neutral/ambiguous.\n*   **Lab software switch and confirmed hard drive failure leading to missing files:** These are mundane, real-world occurrences independent of misconduct (97% if innocent, 95% if guilty). However, they could also serve as convenient excuses for missing data or inconsistencies if misconduct was taking place. This is largely neutral.\n*   **Earlier analysis script included more participants who were later excluded:** This is common during iterative data cleaning (95%) and also a mechanism for selective exclusion to achieve desired results (90%). This is largely neutral.\n\n**Evidence pointing away from academic misconduct:**\n\n*   **No prior record of data irregularities; previous studies passed audit and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible\":** This is a strong point in Lena's favor, suggesting a history of careful and ethical research. The probability of this if she did not commit misconduct was assessed as 99%. The probability if she did commit misconduct was assessed as 70%, implying that even a good record doesn't rule out a first-time offense under extreme pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a positive prior record and many of the \"irregularities\" have mundane explanations, the two most critical pieces of evidence—the **retroactive modification of the preregistration document** and the **highly improbable p-value distribution**—are extremely strong indicators of academic misconduct. These actions are directly contradictory to ethical research practices and statistical norms, respectively. They are not merely \"irregularities\" but clear violations. The motive for such actions is also clearly established by her emails.\n\nThe presence of compelling, direct evidence of specific acts that constitute misconduct (falsifying the preregistration record, statistical patterns consistent with p-hacking) significantly outweighs the general good character indicated by her past record and the plausible innocent explanations for other, less damning pieces of evidence.\n\n90"
