The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The evidence presented offers a mix of mundane explanations and highly suspicious patterns.\n\nLet's weigh the points:\n\n**Evidence consistent with Lena *not* committing misconduct (or at least providing plausible innocent explanations for irregularities):**\n*   **Previous clean audit:** Her prior work was well-documented and reproducible, suggesting a history of good practice.\n*   **Lab-wide robustness push:** Running multiple scripts with different exclusion criteria is a legitimate practice, especially if encouraged by the lab.\n*   **Legitimate exclusions:** Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is standard and proper.\n*   **Technical issues:** The software switch and confirmed hard drive failure are external, plausible, and independently verifiable events that could explain some missing files.\n*   **Earlier script with more participants:** This is consistent with an iterative data cleaning process where initial data is progressively refined.\n*   **Emails expressing pressure:** While showing motive, feeling pressure and wanting a study to succeed are natural human responses in competitive academia, not direct proof of misconduct.\n\n**Evidence highly suggestive of Lena *committing* misconduct:**\n*   **Preregistration modified *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:** This is a severe breach of research integrity. The purpose of preregistration is to prevent post-hoc changes based on observed data. Modifying it *after* data collection to alter primary outcomes and exclusion criteria is a classic method of making exploratory findings appear confirmatory and \"optimizing\" for significance, which constitutes falsification of the research record. An honest researcher would publish an amendment or explain the deviation transparently. The probability of an innocent researcher doing this is extremely low (10%).\n*   **Unusual p-value distribution:** An \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a well-known statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. This pattern is highly improbable to occur by chance, especially across \"several exploratory analyses.\" It strongly suggests that analytical choices were made to achieve statistical significance. The probability of an innocent researcher producing this pattern is extremely low (5%).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there are many pieces of evidence that could be explained innocently (previous good record, technical glitches, legitimate data cleaning steps, and the general pressure of academia), two critical pieces of evidence stand out as extremely difficult to reconcile with a hypothesis of no misconduct:\n\n1.  **The post-data collection modification of the preregistration document** to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria. This is a direct, deliberate act that undermines research transparency and integrity.\n2.  **The highly suspicious p-value distribution**, which is a statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nThese two points are not \"honest mistakes\" or \"miscommunication\" but rather systematic deviations from ethical research practice. They are precisely the kinds of findings that typically emerge when misconduct, specifically p-hacking or falsification of methods, has occurred under pressure. The strong motive expressed in the emails (\"I need this one to work\") further contextualizes why Lena might have taken such actions.\n\nGiven the strength and specificity of these two pieces of evidence, the probability of academic misconduct is very high.\n\n95"
