The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "It is important to evaluate the likelihood of these events occurring naturally in a research setting over the course of a multi-year PhD project, independent of any intentional misconduct.\n\nLet's break down the likelihood of each event:\n\n1.  **A lab switching statistical software package halfway through a project:** This is a reasonably common occurrence in academic research. Labs evolve, new and better software becomes available, supervisors may change preferences or acquire new grants with specific software requirements, or new lab members may introduce different tools. Over a three-year PhD project, a significant shift in software or analysis practices is plausible. I'd estimate this as having a moderate likelihood.\n\n2.  **Lena’s laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files:** Hard drive failures are a known hardware issue that can affect any computer, especially those used intensively for research. The fact that the IT department *confirmed* the hardware failure adds significant credibility to this event being genuine. While many researchers employ backup strategies, it's not uncommon for some files (e.g., very recent work, temporary files, or specific configurations) to be lost or unrecoverable, even with backups, especially if the failure occurs between backup cycles or if the backup system was not perfectly comprehensive for all types of files. Over several years of heavy use, such an event has a moderate likelihood.\n\n**Co-occurrence of both events:**\nThese two events (software switch and hard drive failure) appear to be independent of each other. The likelihood of two independent events both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's assign approximate probabilities:\n*   Probability of a significant software switch during a 3-year PhD project: Perhaps 30-40%.\n*   Probability of a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss during a 3-year PhD project: Perhaps 25-35%.\n\nIf we take the midpoint of these ranges, say 35% for the software switch and 30% for the hard drive failure:\n0.35 * 0.30 = 0.105\n\nThis suggests an approximate 10-11% chance that both of these events would occur naturally during the course of a multi-year PhD project. This is not an extremely high probability, meaning it's not a *common* coincidence. However, it's also not extraordinarily rare or impossible. An event with a 10-11% chance would happen about once every 9-10 similar projects. This means it is a plausible, albeit somewhat coincidental, explanation for observed irregularities or missing files, and would be considered within the realm of \"unlikely but plausible\" rather than \"highly improbable.\"\n\n11"

Lena's potential misconduct would not cause or prevent this event.\n*   **Lena’s laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure:** This is a genuine hardware malfunction, confirmed by the IT department. Lena's potential misconduct would not cause her hard drive to physically fail.\n\nTherefore, the probability of these two circumstantial events occurring *if Lena did academic misconduct* is the same as the probability of them occurring *if she did not academic misconduct*. The presence or absence of misconduct does not influence the likelihood of these independent, external, and objectively confirmed events.\n\nAs calculated previously:\n*   The probability of a significant software switch during a 3-year PhD project is estimated to be around 30-40%.\n*   The probability of a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss during a 3-year PhD project is estimated to be around 25-35%.\n\nAssuming these events are independent, the combined probability would be the product of their individual probabilities. Taking the midpoints (35% and 30%):\n0.35 * 0.30 = 0.105\n\nThis means there is an approximately 10-11% chance that both of these events would occur naturally during the course of a multi-year PhD project, irrespective of Lena's actions regarding data integrity.

    "content": "This scenario describes perfectly normal and expected practice in high-quality cognitive neuroscience research, especially if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Participants with issues are common:** In any study involving human participants, particularly those with demanding cognitive tasks, it is very common for a small percentage to have issues such as not understanding instructions, not paying attention, or even falling asleep. Out of 80 participants, two participants (2.5%) experiencing such issues is a very reasonable and expected occurrence.\n2.  **Exclusion is standard practice:** Data from participants who did not properly engage with the task or follow instructions are generally considered invalid for the purposes of testing the experimental hypothesis. Including their data would introduce noise and potentially obscure or distort the true effect. Therefore, excluding such participants is standard and often required practice in experimental psychology and neuroscience.\n3.  **Documentation in raw data files:** Good research practice dictates that any exclusions and the reasons for them should be meticulously documented. Making notes directly in or alongside the raw data files is an ideal way to maintain transparency and a clear audit trail.\n4.  **Predating journal submission:** The fact that these notes predate the journal submission is critical. It indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made *before* the results were finalized for publication and *before* any external pressure or review. This demonstrates that the exclusions were based on a priori criteria related to data quality and participant performance, rather than being a post-hoc decision to manipulate results.\n\nIf Lena is an honest and competent researcher (i.e., did not commit academic misconduct), this sequence of events is not just likely, but highly indicative of good scientific practice and transparent data handling.\n\n95"

This is an objective reality of data collection, independent of a researcher's integrity. Out of 80 participants, two having such issues (2.5%) is a very reasonable and expected rate.\n2.  **Standard Exclusion Practice:** Excluding participants whose data are compromised due to non-compliance or inattention is standard, legitimate, and often necessary scientific practice to ensure the validity of the results. Even a researcher engaging in misconduct elsewhere would still perform these routine, legitimate exclusions.\n3.  **Documentation for Appearances:** A researcher who is committing misconduct often tries to maintain an appearance of carefulness and adherence to scientific norms in other areas to avoid detection. Meticulously documenting legitimate exclusions in raw data files, with notes predating journal submission, would be a very strategic and expected move for someone attempting to portray themselves as a diligent and honest scientist, even if they were manipulating data in other ways. It provides a credible paper trail for *some* decisions, which could deflect suspicion.\n\nTherefore, the occurrence of legitimate participant issues, their standard exclusion, and their proper documentation are largely independent of whether Lena engaged in academic misconduct in other parts of the study. If anything, a researcher committing misconduct might be *more* careful about documenting these legitimate steps to bolster their overall credibility.\n\n90"

A researcher might succumb to intense pressure (like the \"high-profile experiment\" and \"major grant review\" in this case) on a specific project, even if they have maintained high ethical standards in previous work. A previously clean record doesn't preclude a first instance of misconduct, especially under new or elevated pressure.\n2.  **Building Credibility:** A sophisticated individual engaging in misconduct might deliberately maintain an impeccable record in other, perhaps less scrutinized or lower-stakes, projects. A history of excellent documentation, reproducibility, and passing audits serves as powerful cover and lends credibility, making it harder for others to suspect or detect misconduct in a different, later project.\n3.  **Audits are Not Perfect:** While an independent data audit is robust, it primarily verifies documentation, reproducibility from existing data/scripts, and adherence to protocols. It might not always detect subtle fabrication or falsification if the fabricated data itself is internally consistent and fits the documented methodology. However, the rating of \"well-documented and reproducible\" specifically indicates high standards were met for those *previous* projects.\n4.  **Learning/Evolution:** It's possible that Lena's methods for data handling were genuinely good in the past, and any misconduct (if it occurred) is a more recent development or perhaps more sophisticated in its execution for this specific, high-pressure study.\n\nTherefore, a strong prior record is not incompatible with a later instance of misconduct. In fact, it can sometimes be a characteristic of individuals who commit misconduct under specific pressures, as it provides a foundation of trust and good faith.\n\n75"

It demonstrates that the main results are not fragile or dependent on a single, arbitrary set of decisions.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Policy:** The fact that this is a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" directly implies that this is an encouraged and expected practice within Lena's research environment. If she is an honest researcher, she would naturally follow and contribute to such a positive lab culture.\n3.  **Documentation of Alternatives:** Storing multiple analysis scripts, even those not leading to the final published result, is crucial for transparency and for demonstrating the exploration process. It allows others to understand the analytical decisions made and to potentially replicate the robustness checks.\n4.  **Consistency Across Students:** \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns\" confirms that this is standard operating procedure. An honest Lena would simply be doing what is expected of her as a diligent researcher in that lab.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is not committing misconduct, her engagement in these practices is highly consistent with good scientific conduct and her adherence to the lab's best practices.\n\n98"

Regardless of personal integrity, a student (even one contemplating or engaging in misconduct) would be expected to follow established lab protocols to maintain an appearance of diligence and adherence to standards.\n2.  **Cover for Data Dredging/P-Hacking:** If Lena were inclined to commit misconduct, such as \"p-hacking\" (running multiple analyses until a statistically significant result is found) or \"data dredging\" (exploring various data subsets or exclusion criteria to find a desired outcome), having a legitimate reason to run and store multiple analysis scripts provides excellent cover. She could genuinely run many options, then select the one that yields the \"clean\" or \"strong\" results, while presenting the overall process as legitimate robustness exploration. The existence of alternative scripts (some perhaps not yielding significant results) would make her overall process *look* robust, even if the final selection was biased.\n3.  **Maintaining an Image:** A researcher engaging in misconduct would likely try to appear as a diligent and ethical scientist in other respects to avoid detection. Adhering to lab-wide best practices, especially those promoting transparency and rigor, would be a key part of maintaining this façade.\n4.  **Consistency with Peers:** The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns\" means this is the norm.

This prevents researchers from making data-driven decisions that could inflate statistical significance (p-hacking) or selectively report findings (HARKing - Hypothesizing After the Results are Known).\n2.  **Compromising Integrity:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection, especially to change core elements like primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, fundamentally compromises the integrity of the preregistration process. It essentially negates the commitment made prior to data collection.\n3.  **Ethical Guidelines:** Reputable preregistration platforms and ethical guidelines explicitly state that any changes to a preregistered plan *after* data collection must be clearly marked as such, with a dated amendment or addendum, and a transparent justification. *Modifying the original document* itself to retrospectively change what was promised is considered a severe breach of research ethics and practice, as it creates a false record of the original intentions.\n4.  **Inconsistency with Prior Record:** Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling, and her earlier projects were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\" Such a meticulous researcher would be expected to understand and adhere to the strict principles of preregistration.

If the initial planned analyses or criteria didn't yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support\" for the theory, changing the preregistration retrospectively provides a cover to present the *actual* (possibly manipulated) analysis as if it were planned all along.\n2.  **Pressure to Produce Results:** Lena is under \"pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" If the unmanipulated data, analyzed according to the *original* preregistration, did not yield strong results, a researcher committing misconduct would be highly motivated to alter the plan to match the data that *does* show strong results, thereby fulfilling the pressure.\n3.  **Covering Tracks:** Changing the original document itself (rather than clearly dating and noting an amendment) is a deceptive act aimed at making it appear that the final, favorable analysis was the original intention. This is precisely what someone committing misconduct would do to legitimize their findings and avoid detection.\n4.  **Consistency with \"Too Perfect\" Data:** The anonymous whistleblower's claim that data \"look too perfect\" and \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments\" aligns directly with the idea of a researcher adjusting the goalposts (via preregistration modification) to ensure a clean narrative and statistically significant findings.\n\nTherefore, this action is not just likely, but serves as a strong indicator and facilitating mechanism for academic misconduct focused on achieving specific, publishable outcomes under pressure.\n\n95"

Grant funding is essential for lab survival, and a successful publication record is critical for career progression (like securing a postdoc position). It is very common for PhD students to feel immense pressure from their supervisors and to worry deeply about their own career prospects.\n2.  **Supervisor's Reliance on Grants:** It is a stark reality that grants keep labs afloat. A supervisor \"counting on this study to save the grant\" is a clear and common reflection of the financial precarity many labs face. Students are often acutely aware of this.\n3.  **Impact of Results on Career:** The academic job market is intensely competitive. A \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory\" that yields strong, publishable results can be a career-maker. Conversely, a \"null result\" (especially after significant investment) can indeed be perceived as a setback for a student's publication record and, consequently, their postdoc chances. This is a very real and widely felt anxiety among PhD students.\n4.  **Desire for Success vs. Misconduct:** Saying \"I need this one to work\" expresses a strong *desire* for a positive outcome, which is natural for any invested researcher. This desire, and the associated pressure, can exist completely independently of an intent to commit misconduct. An honest researcher can feel tremendous pressure and still conduct their work ethically, hoping their diligent efforts genuinely lead to significant findings. The emails reflect the *context* of pressure and desire, not necessarily the *method* of achieving the desired outcome.\n\nThese emails paint a picture of a student under significant stress and deeply invested in her project and career.

For multiple exploratory analyses, if some effects are genuinely present and some are not, you would expect a mix of p-values. Crucially, around any arbitrary threshold like .05, you would expect roughly as many p-values just *above* as just *below* it, assuming a continuous distribution and no intentional manipulation.\n2.  **Hallmark of P-hacking/Bias:** The described pattern – a clustering of p-values just below the arbitrary .05 significance threshold, with a stark absence of p-values just above it – is a classic and widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. This occurs when researchers run multiple analyses, adjust exclusion criteria, or stop data collection strategically until a statistically significant result (p < .05) is achieved, and then only report those results.\n3.  **Contradicts Honest Practice:** If Lena conducted her research without misconduct, her p-values for various exploratory analyses would reflect the true underlying effects and random sampling variation. It would be an extraordinary coincidence for many independent analyses to *all* happen to fall just below .05 by chance, while almost none fall just above. This pattern strongly suggests a biased selection or manipulation of results, which is antithetical to honest research.\n\nTherefore, for this specific pattern to emerge naturally in the absence of misconduct would be highly improbable.\n\n5"

These are forms of academic misconduct where researchers manipulate analyses, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or reporting choices until statistically significant results (p < .05) are obtained, while results that fall just above this threshold are either not reported or are subtly adjusted to fall below it.\n2.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The context strongly suggests motivations for misconduct:\n    *   \"High-profile experiment testing a new theory.\"\n    *   Supervisor \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\"\n    *   Lena's emails expressing that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant\" and that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" adding, \"I need this one to work.\"\n    These pressures provide a direct incentive to achieve \"clean\" and \"statistically significant\" results, making p-hacking a highly probable strategy if ethical lines were crossed.\n3.  **Achieving \"Clean\" Results:** The goal of misconduct in this scenario would be to present strong, publishable findings. A distribution of p-values that conveniently clusters just below the .05 threshold, with a noticeable absence just above, creates an artificial appearance of robust significance and a \"clean\" dataset, exactly what a researcher trying to fabricate or falsify results under pressure would aim for.\n\nTherefore, this p-value pattern is not just consistent with misconduct, but is a very strong indicator of it, and precisely what one would expect to see if Lena were engaging in practices to artificially achieve statistical significance.\n\n98"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that an earlier version of her analysis script might include participants who were later excluded from the final dataset.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Iterative Data Cleaning and Refinement:** Data analysis is an iterative process. Researchers often begin with a broader dataset and progressively apply stricter data cleaning and exclusion criteria as they better understand the data's nuances or refine their methodology. Initial scripts might be run on all collected data before the final exclusion criteria are fully applied or before subtle issues (e.g., specific participant behaviors, technical glitches) are detected.\n2.  **Development of Exclusion Criteria:** While general exclusion criteria might be planned in advance, the precise cut-offs or specific reasons for exclusion (e.g., based on performance thresholds, outlier detection methods) can sometimes be refined *after* initial data inspection. An honest researcher would then update their script to reflect these refined, legitimate exclusions.\n3.  **Robustness Checks (as per lab practice):** The lab has a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness,\" which includes running scripts with \"stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria.\" An earlier script might represent an initial, looser set of criteria, which was then refined to a more appropriate, potentially stricter, set for the final analysis.\n4.  **Good Documentation and Version Control:** The fact that an \"earlier version of the analysis script\" was \"recovered from an automated backup\" speaks to good practices in version control and data management. It's natural for a researcher to have multiple versions of scripts as they develop and refine their analyses.\n\nIn the absence of misconduct, the exclusion of participants is typically based on pre-defined or legitimately identified issues (e.g., poor performance, technical errors, non-compliance) that compromise the validity of their data for testing the hypothesis. Therefore, a shift from an initial, more inclusive dataset to a final, more selective one is a common and often necessary step in ensuring data quality and analytical rigor.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that an earlier version of her analysis script might include participants who were later excluded from the final dataset.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Method of Misconduct (P-hacking/Data Dredging):** One common form of academic misconduct, often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"data dredging,\" involves iteratively manipulating data analysis choices (including exclusion criteria) until a statistically significant result is achieved. If Lena were engaged in such practices, she might initially run analyses on a broader dataset and then, seeing the results were not as desired, experiment with excluding certain participants whose data might be obscuring the predicted effect or pushing p-values above the .05 threshold.\n2.  **Achieving \"Clean\" Results:** The goal of misconduct, especially under pressure to produce \"strong, statistically significant support\" and \"clean\" results, would be to refine the dataset to best demonstrate the desired effect. Excluding participants who weaken the effect or introduce noise would be a direct way to achieve this.\n3.  **Lab-Wide Practice as Cover:** The fact that the lab has a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness,\" including running scripts with \"stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria,\" provides a perfect cover for such actions. Lena could argue that the later exclusions were part of legitimate robustness checks or data cleaning, even if the *timing* or *selection* of those exclusions was biased towards achieving a desired p-value.\n4.  **Documentation Trail (despite intent):** The existence of an \"earlier version of the analysis script, recovered from an automated backup,\" simply means different versions of her work were saved. This is independent of whether she was committing misconduct. The content of those different versions (e.g., changing participant exclusions) could then be interpreted as evidence of legitimate iteration or, if misconduct occurred, as evidence of deliberate manipulation to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, finding an earlier script with more participants, with some later excluded, is entirely consistent with (and could even be a direct consequence of) an attempt to strategically manipulate the dataset to achieve publishable results.\n\n90"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence presented:\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting academic misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Preregistration document modified *after data collection* to change planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:** This is a fundamental breach of scientific integrity. The entire purpose of preregistration is to prevent data-driven changes to analytical plans. Modifying the document itself retrospectively, rather than issuing a transparent, dated amendment, is highly indicative of an attempt to legitimize post-hoc decisions. This is extremely unlikely if Lena was not committing misconduct (5% probability), but highly likely if she was (95% probability).\n2.  **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost no p-values just above .05:** This specific pattern is a widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, a form of academic misconduct. It is highly improbable to occur naturally (5% probability if no misconduct) but is a direct expected outcome if misconduct in analysis occurred (98% probability if misconduct).\n3.  **Emails revealing extreme pressure:** Lena's emails (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\") establish a very strong motive for misconduct. While expressing pressure alone is not misconduct, this level of pressure is a common precursor to it, making it highly likely she would write such emails if she were to commit misconduct (98% probability).\n\n**Evidence offering alternative (mundane) explanations or tempering the likelihood of misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Lab switched software & confirmed hard drive failure leading to missing files:** These are genuine, independent technical issues that can happen in research and could explain some file irregularities or losses. The likelihood of these occurring is independent of misconduct (11% probability for both scenarios).\n2.  **Exclusion of two participants with notes predating submission:** This is standard, legitimate practice for data quality control. It's highly likely if no misconduct occurred (95%) and still very likely even if misconduct occurred in other areas (90%), as a researcher would still perform valid exclusions.\n3.  **Strong prior record (passed audit, well-documented/reproducible):** This is a significant point in Lena's favor, indicating past adherence to high standards. It suggests that if misconduct occurred, it might be an isolated incident under extreme pressure, rather than a pattern of dishonesty. It's highly likely if no misconduct (99%) and moderately likely if misconduct (75%), as someone could have a clean record before succumbing to pressure.\n4.  **Lab-wide push for robustness (running multiple analysis scripts with different criteria):** This is good scientific practice and provides a legitimate reason for Lena to have multiple analysis scripts. Highly likely if no misconduct (98%). However, it also provides excellent cover for p-hacking (running many analyses and only reporting/selecting the \"good\" ones), so it's still quite likely even if misconduct occurred (90%).\n5.  **Earlier analysis script with additional participants later excluded:** This is consistent with both legitimate data cleaning/refinement and strategic participant exclusion (p-hacking). It doesn't strongly differentiate between the two scenarios (90% probability for both).\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe two pieces of evidence concerning the retrospective modification of the preregistration document and the anomalous p-value distribution are extremely damning. These are not minor discrepancies or honest mistakes; they are direct indicators of analytical manipulation designed to achieve a desired outcome. The immense pressure Lena was under provides a clear motive for such actions.\n\nWhile Lena's strong prior record, the lab's good practices, and the technical issues offer some mitigating context, they do not sufficiently explain away these two critical pieces of evidence. A good prior record does not guarantee future ethical behavior, especially under new, intense pressure. The lab's robustness push, while positive in intent, could have been exploited.\n\nThe weight of evidence, particularly the direct signs of p-hacking and the integrity breach of the preregistration, points strongly towards academic misconduct.\n\n95"
