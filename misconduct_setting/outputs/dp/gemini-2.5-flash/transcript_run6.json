The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is a realistic occurrence in any dataset.\n2.  **Exclusion is standard practice:** When a participant's data is compromised (e.g., due to not following instructions or falling asleep), it is standard and necessary practice to exclude their data to maintain the integrity and validity of the study. Including such data would introduce noise or bias.\n3.  **Documentation is crucial:** A responsible researcher would document the reasons for exclusion. Notes in raw data files are a common and transparent way to record such issues and justify later data cleaning decisions. This demonstrates meticulous data handling.\n4.  **Predating submission is essential for transparency:** Making and documenting these exclusion decisions *before* any journal submission is a hallmark of good research practice. It shows that the exclusions were principled methodological decisions, made independently of the pressure to achieve specific results or respond to reviewers. It prevents any suspicion of \"p-hacking\" or post-hoc data manipulation designed to improve results.\n\nGiven that Lena has a \"previously strong record of careful data handling,\" this specific action aligns perfectly with what would be expected of a conscientious and ethical researcher who is *not* committing misconduct. It demonstrates good scientific hygiene and transparent data management.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is innocent of misconduct, this scenario is not just likely, but highly expected as a proper way to handle compromised participant data.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

Even a researcher intending to manipulate data would likely encounter such situations.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A key strategy for someone committing misconduct is to make their research appear rigorous and legitimate. Documenting valid exclusions in the raw data files, especially before submission, is a standard and expected practice in good research. This action could be part of a broader effort to present a credible and clean dataset, masking other less ethical data handling choices. It makes the researcher look diligent and transparent.\n3.  **Facilitating Data Cleaning for Desired Outcomes:** Excluding \"problematic\" participants (whether genuinely problematic or just not yielding desired results) is a way to clean a dataset. Using legitimate, documented reasons for exclusion makes this data cleaning appear justifiable, even if other, less transparent exclusions or manipulations are also occurring.\n4.  **Not Mutually Exclusive:** Academic misconduct often involves a mix of legitimate and illegitimate actions. It's entirely possible that Lena performed some aspects of data collection and cleaning correctly, while committing misconduct in other areas (e.g., selective inclusion/exclusion beyond these two, p-hacking, or outright fabrication). These two exclusions could be genuinely warranted and properly documented, even if other aspects of her data handling were fraudulent.\n\nIn essence, this specific action (legitimate exclusion with proper documentation) is entirely compatible with, and could even serve the purposes of, someone attempting to commit academic misconduct while maintaining an appearance of scientific integrity.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 70"

It demonstrates thoroughness, a commitment to understanding the data's sensitivities, and a proactive approach to addressing potential limitations or biases in the chosen analytical path. This is a hallmark of rigorous research, not misconduct.\n2.  **Lab-Wide Policy:** The fact that this is explicitly described as \"part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" makes it even more likely.

It indicates a culture of methodological rigor and transparency, not one conducive to hiding selective analyses.\n4.  **Transparency and Documentation:** Storing these scripts in data management logs is also a positive indicator.

A researcher, even one committing misconduct, would likely conform to these overt lab protocols to avoid drawing suspicion to themselves. Not following a visible lab-wide initiative would be a red flag.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A key strategy for someone engaging in misconduct is to make their work *appear* legitimate and rigorous. Documenting robustness checks, even if some of them are superficial or used selectively, contributes to this appearance of thoroughness and good scientific practice. It creates a plausible narrative for the analytical process.\n3.  **Plausible Deniability/Cover:** Having multiple scripts, some with stricter and some with looser criteria, could provide a convenient cover for making specific data cleaning or analysis choices that ultimately benefit the desired outcome. If later questioned, Lena could point to the variety of analyses as evidence of due diligence, even if her *final* selection was biased.\n4.  **Opportunity for \"P-Hacking\" or Selective Reporting:** The existence of multiple analysis paths, including different exclusion criteria, inherently offers more opportunities for a dishonest researcher to \"find\" a statistically significant result (e.g., by trying different criteria until the p-value dips below .05). While the stated purpose is robustness, this flexibility can be exploited, and the documentation of these varied attempts could paradoxically be used to obscure the selective reporting of the \"best\" result.\n\nIn essence, this specific action aligns with standard good practice and lab-wide culture.

The case mentions Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review,\" and Lena's experiment is \"high-profile.\" This specific, heightened pressure could have led Lena to deviate from her usual ethical standards for the first time. If this is the case, her previous work would genuinely have been conducted ethically and meticulously, meaning the audit results would be accurate.\n\n2.  **Building a Reputation/Cover:** A researcher contemplating or engaging in misconduct might consciously or unconsciously build a strong record of integrity in other projects. Having a history of clean audits and well-documented research makes it harder for others to suspect misconduct when it eventually occurs, providing a layer of credibility.\n\n3.  **Limitations of Audits:** While independent data audits are robust, their scope can vary. An audit primarily focused on \"well-documented and reproducible\" practices would verify that the raw data and scripts allow for the reported results to be regenerated and that the process is transparently organized. It might not always detect sophisticated fabrication or falsification of *raw* data, especially if the fabricated data is consistently documented within the established framework. It's possible to fabricate data points while still having well-organized and reproducible analysis scripts.\n\n4.  **Nature of Past Misconduct (if any):** If Lena had committed misconduct in the past, it's possible it was of a less severe nature, less detectable by the specific audit, or she was simply more successful at concealing it. However, the scenario specifically states \"no prior record of data irregularities,\" implying that any past misconduct was either non-existent or expertly hidden beyond detection, even by an independent audit. The simplest explanation here, in the context of *assuming current misconduct*, is the \"first-time offender\" under pressure scenario.\n\nGiven the explicit pressure context for the current study, it is quite plausible that Lena's previous impeccable record and successful audit are genuine, and the current alleged misconduct is an isolated incident or a new development.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 75"

Doing so \"halfway through a project\" can be inconvenient but is not unusual, especially if the project has a long duration or the decision was driven by external factors.\n2.  **Hardware Failures:** Laptop hard drive failures are a common occurrence in the life cycle of electronic devices. Researchers, like any other computer users, are susceptible to such technical mishaps. The fact that the IT department \"confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time\" provides objective verification that this was a genuine technical issue, not a manufactured excuse.\n3.  **Data Loss:** While good researchers implement backup protocols, even the most diligent can experience some data loss when an unexpected hardware failure occurs, especially if the most recent backups haven't been completed or if some unique files were only stored locally.

Its fundamental purpose is to prevent bias, p-hacking, and hypothesizing after results are known (HARKing).\n2.  **Violation of Preregistration Principles:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection, specifically to change primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, directly violates the core principles of preregistration.

An ethical researcher committed to avoiding misconduct would be acutely aware of this perception and avoid such modifications, or handle them with extreme transparency and justification, usually by explicitly stating what was preregistered vs. what was actually done and why the deviation occurred.\n4.  **No Innocent Justification for These Specific Changes:** While minor clerical errors might be corrected in a preregistration after data collection (with clear documentation), changing *exclusion criteria* and *primary outcomes* is a substantive alteration that directly impacts the integrity of the study's stated hypothesis testing.

If the initial analysis based on the original preregistration did not yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory,\" Lena would be incentivized to adjust the parameters until the results improved.\n2.  **Responding to Pressure:** Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" If Lena is engaging in misconduct, it is precisely to meet this pressure. Changing exclusion criteria can \"clean up\" the data to reveal a stronger effect, and changing primary outcomes allows for the selection of an outcome measure that happened to show significance.\n3.  **Retroactive Justification:** By altering the preregistration document, Lena would be attempting to retroactively legitimize these post-hoc analytical choices, making them *appear* as if they were pre-planned.

Researchers typically start with a raw dataset and progressively apply exclusion criteria. It is common to have initial scripts that include all participants, and then develop subsequent scripts that apply more refined or specific exclusion rules as understanding of the data or task performance evolves.\n2.  **Refining Exclusion Criteria:** Even with pre-defined criteria, the practical application can require judgment and refinement. A researcher might initially include a participant, then later, upon closer inspection of their raw data (e.g., task performance, response times, or notes from the experimenter), realize they don't meet quality standards or criteria for inclusion (e.g., falling asleep, misunderstanding instructions, poor performance on attention checks).\n3.  **Lab-Wide Practices:** Given that the lab has a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that Lena is running \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria,\" it is highly consistent with good practice to iterate on exclusion decisions.

An earlier script with a broader inclusion criterion, followed by a final script with a narrower one, directly indicates this process.\n2.  **Iterative Optimization:** A researcher intent on manipulating results would likely iterate through different exclusion criteria. They might start with a full dataset, run analyses, see that the results are not significant, and then progressively apply stricter or different exclusion rules (or even specific participant removals) until the p-value drops to the desired level. The earlier script would represent a point before these \"optimizations\" were finalized.\n3.  **Cover for Manipulation:** Even if the *reasons* for exclusion were fabricated or opportunistically applied (e.g., using a minor reported issue to exclude a participant whose data harms the desired effect), having an earlier script that includes these participants makes the *process* look like legitimate data cleaning and refinement. The difference lies in the intent behind the *final* exclusions.\n4.  **Consistency with Pressure:** The strong pressure to produce publishable findings makes it highly probable that Lena would explore various ways to achieve significance, and participant exclusion is a potent tool for this.\n\nTherefore, finding an earlier script with more participants, from which some were later excluded, is a very strong indicator and a likely mechanism for achieving desired (but potentially manipulated) results if misconduct is present.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 90"

If there are true effects, p-values would be continuously distributed, and some would naturally fall just above .05 (e.g., .051, .053) alongside those just below. If there are no true effects, p-values would be uniformly distributed across the range [0, 1].\n2.  **Statistical Improbability:** An \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05\" with \"almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting.

These are forms of academic misconduct where researchers conduct multiple analyses, stop when a significant result is found, or make small adjustments to data or models until the p-value dips below the arbitrary .05 threshold.\n2.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The context states that Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings.\" If Lena is engaging in misconduct, her primary motivation would be to achieve such \"publishable findings,\" which typically means obtaining statistically significant results. P-hacking is a direct way to achieve this.\n3.  **Exploratory Analyses:** The fact that this pattern appears in \"several exploratory analyses\" is particularly telling. Exploratory analyses offer more flexibility in analytical choices (e.g., which variables to include, how to model relationships, which specific tests to run), providing ample opportunity for a dishonest researcher to experiment with different approaches until desired p-values emerge.\n4.  **Cover-up Mechanism:** If Lena manipulated the data or analyses to get significant results, she would report these results. This specific pattern is the expected outcome of such manipulation.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is indeed committing academic misconduct, this p-value distribution is not just likely, but serves as very strong evidence consistent with that misconduct.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies she is an ethical, but still human, researcher operating under typical academic pressures.\n\nUnder this assumption:\n1.  **High-Stakes Academic Environment:** Academia, especially at the PhD and postdoc level, is highly competitive and pressure-filled. Grant funding is critical for labs, and publishing in top journals is essential for career progression (like securing a postdoc position). It is entirely common and realistic for PhD students to feel immense pressure regarding the success of their projects.\n2.  **Supervisor Expectations:** It is plausible that Professor Mills genuinely *was* counting on this study for the grant review. Supervisors often place high hopes on high-profile experiments. Lena expressing this in an email to a friend is simply reflecting the reality of her lab's situation.\n3.  **Career Impact of Results:** The concern that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" is a widespread and legitimate anxiety among PhD students. Funders and hiring committees often look for impactful, \"positive\" (i.e., hypothesis-supporting) results. This is a common, though unfortunate, aspect of scientific culture.\n4.  **Desire for Success:** The statement \"I need this one to work\" expresses a strong desire for the study to yield meaningful, publishable results that support the theory being tested. This is a natural aspiration for any researcher who has invested significant time and effort into a project and believes in the underlying theory. It means she wants the science to demonstrate what she expects, not that she intends to manipulate it.\n\nThese emails articulate common anxieties and pressures experienced by many PhD students in high-stakes research environments. They reflect a desire for professional success and an awareness of the pressures, but they do not inherently suggest an intent to commit fraud. An ethical researcher can feel this pressure and desire for success while still maintaining their integrity.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that she would express these very normal academic pressures and aspirations in a private communication with a friend.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is extremely likely that she would write emails expressing the sentiments that her supervisor was counting on the study, that a null result would harm her postdoc chances, and that she \"needs this one to work.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Strong Motivation for Misconduct:** These statements articulate precisely the kind of intense personal and professional pressure that often serves as a primary motivator for academic misconduct. The fear of disappointing a supervisor (whose grant is at stake) and the profound anxiety about one's own career prospects (postdoc chances) are powerful incentives to ensure a study yields \"positive\" results, even if it means resorting to unethical means.\n2.  **Rationalization/Justification:** For a researcher contemplating or engaging in misconduct, these pressures can serve as a form of rationalization or internal justification for their actions. The perceived high stakes (\"save the grant,\" \"kill my chances at a postdoc\") can make the act of manipulation seem like a necessary evil.\n3.  **Reflection of Reality:** Even if Lena committed misconduct, the pressures she describes are likely genuine. Professor Mills *is* under pressure, and null results *can* indeed hinder career progression. These emails are a realistic reflection of the academic environment, which can drive even previously ethical individuals to make poor choices under duress.\n4.  **Desire for Specific Outcome:** The phrase \"I need this one to work\" directly signals a strong personal investment in a specific outcome (i.e., supporting the theory), which can easily lead to manipulating data if the genuine results do not align with that desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, these emails are not only consistent with a scenario of misconduct but provide a very plausible and common psychological context for *why* someone might commit it.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 95"

It is extremely unlikely for an ethical researcher to do this.\n*   **The final dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05:** This is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking, which is a form of academic misconduct aimed at achieving statistically significant results through selective reporting or analysis. It is extraordinarily unlikely to occur by chance.\n\nEvidence that establishes a strong motive for misconduct but doesn't prove it:\n*   Emails to a friend indicating high pressure from her supervisor regarding grant review and concern that a null result would \"kill my chances at a postdoc,\" adding \"I need this one to work\": While a genuine reflection of academic pressure, this clearly outlines a strong motivation for Lena to ensure the study yielded positive results.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Lena has a strong prior record of integrity and some irregularities can be explained by technical issues, the evidence regarding the preregistration modification and the p-value distribution is overwhelmingly damning. These are not minor errors or miscommunications; they are direct, well-recognized indicators of intentional manipulation of the research process to achieve desired outcomes. The likelihood of these two specific patterns occurring by chance or through innocent error in an ethical study is exceptionally low. When combined with the high-stakes pressure she articulated, these actions strongly suggest that Lena engaged in academic misconduct for this specific study, despite her prior good record.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 98"
