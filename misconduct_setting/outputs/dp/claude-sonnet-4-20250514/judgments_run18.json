The combination of p-values clustering just below .05 with almost none above, coupled with post-hoc modifications to the preregistration document after data collection, represents classic indicators of research misconduct that are extremely difficult to explain through honest research practices alone.\n\nWhile Lena has some mitigating factors (good prior record, legitimate participant exclusions, routine technical issues), the objective statistical signatures of manipulation - particularly when considered together - point strongly toward intentional data manipulation rather than coincidental irregularities."
