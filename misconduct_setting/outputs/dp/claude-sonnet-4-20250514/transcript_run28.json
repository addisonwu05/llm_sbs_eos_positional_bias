The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In this scenario:\n\n1. **High baseline competence**: Graduate students who make it to their third year in competitive PhD programs typically have demonstrated research skills and attention to detail.\n\n2. **Institutional validation**: An independent data audit that rated her work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" represents external validation of her research practices.

Someone who maintains high standards of data management and documentation typically does so consistently across projects.\n\n4. **No red flags**: If she were prone to cutting corners, fabricating data, or poor research practices, we would expect to see warning signs in her earlier work, especially under the scrutiny of an independent audit.\n\n5. **Lab environment**: Working in the same lab suggests consistent training, standards, and oversight across her projects.\n\nGiven these factors, if Lena is indeed innocent of misconduct, it would be highly expected that her previous work would legitimately pass audits and receive positive ratings for documentation and reproducibility.

As a third-year PhD student facing a high-profile study with a supervisor under grant pressure, Lena might be experiencing unprecedented stress that wasn't present during earlier, lower-stakes projects.\n\n2. **Opportunistic misconduct**: The current study's circumstances (sole data processing responsibility, high visibility, time pressure) might have created a unique opportunity/temptation that didn't exist previously when there may have been more oversight or lower stakes.\n\n3. **Learning curve of deception**: Earlier in her PhD, she might not have had the technical skills or confidence to manipulate data effectively, making honest work the path of least resistance.\n\n4. **Different project characteristics**: Her earlier studies might have genuinely produced clean, significant results that didn't require manipulation, while this particular study might have yielded disappointing initial results that tempted her to \"improve\" them.\n\n**Factors that make this less likely:**\n\n1. **Personality consistency**: Research misconduct often reflects underlying character traits or attitudes toward research integrity that would likely manifest across multiple projects.\n\n2. **Audit rigor**: Independent audits specifically look for signs of data manipulation and poor practices - it would be unusual for someone prone to misconduct to completely avoid detection.\n\n3. **Documentation skills**: The ability to maintain \"well-documented and reproducible\" work requires genuine organizational skills and attention to detail that seem inconsistent with fabricating data.\n\nHowever, the situational factors and pressure escalation make it reasonably plausible that someone could transition from honest to dishonest practices, especially if the earlier work was conducted under different circumstances with less pressure and more oversight.\n\n73"

Studies routinely exclude 5-15% of participants for various reasons including fatigue, task misunderstanding, or inattention.\n\n2. **Standard protocol**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions is not only appropriate but necessary for data quality. These are textbook examples of legitimate exclusion criteria that any competent researcher would apply.\n\n3. **Proper documentation timing**: Recording exclusion reasons in real-time during data collection (before analysis or submission) represents best practice in research documentation.

The stress would be real regardless of intended response.\n\n4. **Unconscious revelation**: People often reveal their true motivations in private communications without realizing the implications. These statements show she was already thinking in terms of needing specific outcomes rather than discovering truth.\n\n5. **Timeline significance**: If these emails preceded the misconduct, they establish the psychological state that could lead to questionable decisions later.\n\n6. **Pressure-to-action pathway**: Research shows that perceived pressure (career stakes, supervisor expectations) is one of the strongest predictors of research misconduct. These emails document exactly that mindset.\n\n7. **Results-oriented thinking**: The phrase \"needs this one to work\" suggests outcome-focused rather than process-focused thinking - a mindset consistent with later manipulation to ensure desired results.\n\nThese emails would represent classic evidence of the motivational framework that leads to research misconduct.\n\n89"

Researchers routinely start with initial datasets and then refine them as they identify issues, apply quality control measures, or discover problems with specific participants.\n\n2. **Quality control discovery**: As researchers examine their data more carefully, they often identify participants who should be excluded based on predetermined criteria - technical failures, non-compliance, outliers, or other validity concerns that weren't immediately apparent.\n\n3. **Automated backup timing**: Backup systems capture work-in-progress, often preserving earlier versions before final quality control is complete. This creates a natural record of the refinement process.\n\n4. **Documented exclusion patterns**: We already know Lena had legitimate exclusions (participants who fell asleep/didn't understand) with proper documentation, suggesting a systematic approach to data quality.\n\n5. **Multi-stage analysis**: Complex studies often involve multiple rounds of data checking, where initial analyses reveal participant-level issues that require exclusion (e.g., extreme response patterns, technical problems, failure to meet inclusion criteria).\n\n6. **Best practice methodology**: Careful researchers typically err on the side of inclusion initially, then apply stricter quality control as they better understand their data characteristics.\n\n7. **Lab robustness initiative**: The lab-wide focus on testing different exclusion criteria would naturally create multiple versions of scripts with varying participant inclusion.\n\nThis represents exactly what we'd expect from careful, legitimate research practices.\n\n88"

The earlier script would capture the \"before\" state of this process.\n\n2. **Strategic data manipulation**: Participant exclusion is a powerful tool for p-hacking.

The combination of post-hoc modifications to the preregistration document after data collection and the highly suspicious p-value distribution (clustering just below .05 with virtually none just above .05) constitutes compelling statistical and procedural evidence of systematic result manipulation. These patterns are extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices and represent classic signatures of p-hacking and questionable research practices. While individual pieces of evidence might have innocent explanations, their convergence - particularly the objective digital evidence of preregistration tampering and unnatural statistical patterns - creates an overwhelming case for misconduct."
