  "Yes.\n\nThe statistical evidence is too compelling to ignore. The clustering of p-values just below .05 across multiple analyses with virtually none above .05 is extremely unlikely to occur naturally in legitimate research. Combined with the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, this creates a pattern that is very difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nWhile Lena has positive factors in her favor (clean prior record, legitimate technical issues, standard lab practices), the core statistical anomalies and preregistration tampering represent fundamental violations of research integrity that are characteristic signatures of deliberate misconduct rather than honest mistakes or questionable but innocent practices."
