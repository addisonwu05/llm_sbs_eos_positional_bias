  "Looking at the totality of evidence, particularly the most statistically diagnostic indicators:\n\nThe post-hoc modification of the preregistration document to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a fundamental violation of research integrity principles. Combined with the highly suspicious p-value distribution showing clustering just below .05 with almost no values above .05, these create statistical and methodological signatures that are extremely unlikely to occur through honest research practices.\n\nWhile Lena has some mitigating factors (strong previous track record, legitimate technical issues, proper documentation of some procedures), the core statistical evidence points strongly toward systematic manipulation of analyses and documentation to achieve desired results.\n\nThe pattern of evidence - high-pressure context, sole control of data processing, post-hoc preregistration changes, and telltale p-value clustering - represents classic indicators of research misconduct that together overcome the exculpatory evidence.\n\n**Yes**"
