  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests Lena committed academic misconduct. The most compelling factors are:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modification**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a fundamental violation of research integrity that directly enables manipulation.\n\n2. **Statistical red flags**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 across multiple analyses is a classic signature of p-hacking that's extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Systematic pattern**: The combination of participant exclusions between analysis versions, suspicious statistical patterns, and protocol modifications suggests coordinated manipulation rather than isolated issues.\n\nWhile her previous clean audit record creates some doubt, and technical disruptions provide partial explanations for some irregularities, they cannot adequately account for the most damaging evidence. The documented pressure and results-oriented mindset provide clear motive, and the statistical and procedural anomalies form a coherent pattern consistent with systematic data manipulation.\n\nThe technical explanations (software changes, hardware failure) and standard lab practices explain some peripheral issues but don't address the core problems of post-hoc protocol changes and statistical manipulation patterns."
