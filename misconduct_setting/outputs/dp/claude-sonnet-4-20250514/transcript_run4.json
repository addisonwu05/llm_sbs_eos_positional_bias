The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Creating multiple analysis scripts that could be scrutinized later would be counterproductive to covering up misconduct. Someone engaging in fraud would more likely run a single \"clean\" analysis to avoid leaving evidence of experimentation.\n\n**Additional context:**\nThe fact that this was part of a lab-wide initiative, with other students showing identical patterns, makes it extremely unlikely that this represents misconduct. Lab-wide practices are typically established by supervisors and represent legitimate methodological approaches.\n\nThis evidence appears to be normal scientific practice for testing robustness, especially given the lab context and similar behavior by peers.\n\n85"

The p-value pattern defies natural statistical distributions and perfectly matches manipulation signatures\n2. The preregistration modifications represent unambiguous misconduct with objective timestamp evidence\n\nWhile Lena's previous good record and the technical explanations provide some doubt, the statistical evidence and preregistration tampering are extremely difficult to explain through innocent means. The preregistration modifications alone constitute research misconduct regardless of data fabrication.\n\nThe combination of statistical manipulation signatures and documented preregistration falsification outweighs the mitigating factors.\n\n75"

Combined with the highly suspicious p-value distribution pattern across multiple analyses - clustering just below .05 with almost no values just above .05 - these form a compelling case for intentional data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's previous good record and some technical explanations provide mitigating context, the preregistration falsification alone constitutes research misconduct regardless of other factors, and the statistical signature strongly suggests systematic p-hacking or data manipulation."
