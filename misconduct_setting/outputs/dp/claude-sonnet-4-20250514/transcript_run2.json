The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Participants who fall asleep during cognitive tasks or who don't understand the instructions represent clear threats to data validity that any competent researcher would identify and exclude.\n\nSeveral factors make this evidence highly consistent with legitimate research practices:\n\n1. **Standard exclusion criteria**: Sleep and comprehension failures are among the most common and universally accepted reasons for participant exclusion in cognitive research. These directly compromise the ability to perform the task as intended.\n\n2. **Proper documentation timing**: The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission suggests these decisions were made during data collection or initial processing, which is when such exclusions would naturally occur in legitimate research.\n\n3. **Reasonable prevalence**: Out of 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5%) with these issues falls well within the expected range for such problems in cognitive studies.\n\n4. **Real-time identification**: Both falling asleep and not understanding instructions would be readily apparent during data collection or initial review, making immediate documentation natural.\n\n5. **Conservative research practice**: Documenting exclusions contemporaneously and excluding problematic participants represents good, conservative research methodology.\n\nIf Lena were fabricating data, she would be unlikely to create fake exclusions with backdated documentation, as this adds unnecessary complexity. Fabricators typically either don't exclude anyone (to avoid complications) or exclude participants to improve results, not for standard methodological reasons with proper temporal documentation.\n\nThis evidence appears entirely consistent with normal, ethical research practices and provides no indication of misconduct.\n\n95"

    "content": "Looking at this from the perspective that Lena did commit academic misconduct, I need to consider whether someone engaged in data fabrication or falsification would still legitimately exclude participants for standard methodological reasons.\n\nEven if Lena committed misconduct, there are several reasons why these exclusions could still occur legitimately:\n\n1. **Mixed misconduct scenarios**: Academic misconduct rarely involves fabricating an entire dataset from scratch. More commonly, researchers might selectively alter specific data points, manipulate particular analyses, or engage in questionable research practices while maintaining some legitimate procedures. Lena could have committed misconduct in other aspects while still properly handling obvious participant exclusions.\n\n2. **Maintaining plausible cover**: A researcher engaged in misconduct would likely want to maintain the appearance of following standard procedures. Properly documenting and excluding participants who clearly couldn't complete the task (fell asleep, didn't understand) would be expected behavior that helps maintain credibility.\n\n3. **Real participants, manipulated data**: The misconduct might involve manipulating the actual data from valid participants rather than creating fake participants. In this case, legitimate exclusions of problematic participants would still occur normally.\n\n4. **Selective fabrication**: Misconduct could involve fabricating data for specific measures or conditions while legitimately collecting and processing other aspects of the study, including proper participant exclusions.\n\n5. **Temporal separation**: The participant exclusions might have occurred during legitimate data collection phases, with any misconduct happening later during analysis or reporting stages.\n\n6. **Standard practice maintenance**: Even someone committing misconduct would likely follow routine, easily-auditable procedures like excluding obviously invalid participants, focusing their misconduct on less easily detected areas.\n\nThe fact that these exclusions follow standard methodological practices with proper documentation timing doesn't preclude misconduct occurring elsewhere in the research process.\n\n75"

An honest researcher would recognize this as crossing clear ethical boundaries.\n\n**Alternative approaches for legitimate researchers:**\nAn honest researcher discovering issues with their preregistration would transparently report deviations, treat additional analyses as exploratory, or acknowledge limitations rather than secretly modifying the preregistration.\n\n15"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the factors supporting and contradicting academic misconduct:\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **P-value clustering**: The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none above .05 is one of the strongest statistical indicators of data manipulation. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally (I assessed 10% likelihood if innocent, 92% if misconduct).\n\n2. **Post-data preregistration modification**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection violates fundamental research integrity principles. This is rarely done by honest researchers (15% likelihood if innocent) but extremely common in misconduct (95% likelihood if misconduct).\n\n3. **Participant exclusion pattern**: Earlier scripts showing more participants later excluded, combined with the suspicious p-values, suggests results-driven exclusions rather than legitimate quality control.\n\n4. **Documented pressure**: Lena's emails about needing results to \"work\" for career and grant purposes establish clear motive for misconduct.\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n\n1. **Strong prior record**: Previous studies passed independent audits and were rated as well-documented and reproducible, suggesting established patterns of research integrity.\n\n2. **Standard exclusions**: The two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding represent legitimate, well-documented exclusions with proper timing.\n\n3. **Lab practices**: Multiple analysis scripts and robustness testing reflect lab-wide methodological standards.\n\n4. **Technical issues**: Software changes and confirmed hardware failures provide some context for complications.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from objective, statistical patterns (p-value clustering) and documented behavioral violations (preregistration modification) that are extremely difficult to explain through innocent means. These represent \"smoking gun\" evidence that overwhelms the supporting factors.\n\nWhile Lena's prior good record is notable, the current evidence shows patterns that are virtually diagnostic of misconduct. The combination of statistical manipulation signatures, document falsification, and clear motive creates a compelling case.\n\nThe technical complications and lab practices, while providing some context, don't adequately explain the most damning evidence and may have actually facilitated rather than caused the misconduct.\n\n85"

The post-hoc modification of the preregistration document to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles.\n\n3. The progression from earlier analysis scripts with more participants to a final dataset with strategic exclusions, combined with the suspicious statistical patterns, suggests results-driven data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena has mitigating factors (strong prior record, documented technical issues, lab-wide practices), the combination of statistical evidence and documented procedural violations creates a pattern that is far more consistent with misconduct than with honest research practices that happened to go wrong.\n\nThe objective evidence - particularly the p-value distribution and timestamp evidence of preregistration modification - represents the type of \"smoking gun\" indicators that are very difficult to explain through innocent means."
