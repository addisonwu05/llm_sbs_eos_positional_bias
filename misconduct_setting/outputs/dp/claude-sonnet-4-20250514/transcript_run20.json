The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this specific piece of evidence, I need to consider how common it is for participants to fall asleep or not understand instructions in cognitive neuroscience experiments, and whether it's standard practice to document and exclude such participants.\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience studies, particularly those involving memory tasks:\n\n1. **Participant issues are common**: It's quite normal for some participants to fall asleep during lengthy or repetitive tasks, especially in controlled laboratory environments. Similarly, some participants genuinely struggle to understand complex experimental instructions despite briefings.\n\n2. **Standard exclusion criteria**: Most well-designed studies have pre-established criteria for excluding participants who don't complete the task properly. Falling asleep or failing to understand instructions are classic, legitimate reasons for exclusion that are typically outlined in study protocols.\n\n3. **Documentation practices**: Good research practice involves taking notes during data collection about any issues that arise. Documenting these problems in real-time (during or immediately after testing sessions) is standard procedure and necessary for later justifying exclusions.\n\n4. **Timing of notes**: The fact that these exclusion notes predate the journal submission is actually what we'd expect if this were legitimate. Researchers typically clean their datasets and apply exclusion criteria before beginning their main analyses, which happens well before manuscript submission.\n\n5. **Sample size**: With 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5%) excluded for these reasons falls well within the typical range of exclusions seen in cognitive studies.\n\nThe evidence presented here aligns perfectly with normal, ethical research practices. There's nothing suspicious about excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, especially when this was documented contemporaneously in the raw data files.\n\n85"

More commonly, researchers might selectively manipulate or fabricate portions of data while keeping legitimate elements intact. Real participant issues would still occur and need addressing.\n\n2. **Maintaining plausible cover**: If Lena were manipulating data, she would likely want to maintain normal research practices for obviously legitimate exclusions. Properly documenting genuine participant problems helps create a veneer of normal, careful methodology.\n\n3. **Timeline considerations**: Even if misconduct occurred, it likely happened during analysis phases rather than initial data collection. Early documentation of clear participant issues (falling asleep, confusion) would have been done before any pressure to manipulate results emerged.\n\n4. **Risk management**: Fabricating fake exclusion reasons would be unnecessarily risky when real exclusions provide legitimate ways to refine the dataset. Why create fraudulent documentation when genuine issues provide defensible exclusions?\n\n5. **Standard operating procedure**: These types of exclusions are so routine and expected that even someone engaging in misconduct would likely handle them normally, focusing their manipulation efforts on more subtle aspects of the data.\n\n6. **Investigative scrutiny**: Fabricated exclusion notes would be relatively easy for investigators to detect through inconsistencies in documentation style, timing, or participant contact records.\n\nThe exclusion of participants with documented, legitimate issues would likely occur regardless of whether other misconduct took place.\n\n78"

Among many stored scripts exploring different approaches, fraudulent analyses would be much harder to detect. Investigators might assume suspicious results are just part of normal robustness checking.\n\n**Following lab protocols**: Even while engaging in misconduct, Lena would need to participate in the lab-wide robustness initiative to avoid suspicion.

More commonly, researchers conduct some legitimate analyses while selectively manipulating others. The robustness checking could be genuine while specific analyses are fraudulent.\n\n**Institutional pressure management**: Under pressure to produce results, Lena might genuinely explore multiple approaches hoping to find significant effects legitimately, only resorting to manipulation when those fail. The scripts could represent real attempts before misconduct.\n\n**Documentation strategy**: Keeping detailed logs of various analyses creates an appearance of transparency and methodological rigor. This makes any questionable results seem like part of systematic exploration rather than targeted manipulation.\n\n**Peer mimicry**: Matching other students' analytical patterns helps normalize her behavior and reduces the chance of standing out during any scrutiny.\n\n**Version control benefits**: Having multiple versions provides opportunities to identify which manipulated analyses produce the best results while maintaining plausible alternative explanations.\n\nThe lab-wide initiative actually facilitates rather than prevents potential misconduct.\n\n75"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, finding earlier analysis scripts with more participants who were later excluded would still be quite likely and could actually facilitate fraudulent behavior.\n\n**Strategic exclusion for desired results**: Someone engaging in misconduct might systematically exclude participants whose data don't support the desired findings. The earlier script with more participants could represent legitimate data collection, while later exclusions might be strategically motivated rather than methodologically justified.\n\n**Trial and error manipulation**: The progression from more to fewer participants could reflect testing different sample compositions to see which produces significant results. This represents a form of p-hacking where exclusion criteria are adjusted based on outcomes rather than predetermined quality standards.\n\n**Covering manipulation tracks**: Starting with legitimate inclusive scripts provides good cover - it makes the research appear to follow normal quality control procedures while actually representing strategic data selection.\n\n**Selective application of criteria**: Someone could apply exclusion criteria inconsistently, keeping participants who support their hypothesis while excluding those who don't, using the earlier inclusive script as evidence of \"thorough\" methodology.\n\n**Post-hoc justification**: The exclusions might be reverse-engineered - first determining which participants need to be removed to achieve significance, then creating plausible-sounding exclusion criteria to justify those specific removals.\n\n**Mixed legitimate/illegitimate exclusions**: Some exclusions might be genuinely justified while others are strategically motivated, making the overall pattern appear normal while containing fraudulent elements.\n\nThe script progression provides both cover for misconduct and a mechanism for achieving desired results.\n\n75"

    "content": "Looking at all the evidence comprehensively, I need to weigh the strongly exonerating factors against the highly suspicious statistical and procedural anomalies.\n\n**Evidence strongly favoring innocence:**\n- Clean track record with previous work passing independent audit\n- Legitimate participant exclusions with contemporaneous documentation\n- Lab-wide robustness checking protocols explaining multiple analysis scripts\n- Independently verified technical issues (software transition, hardware failure)\n- Normal graduate student pressure expressions\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n- Extremely suspicious p-value clustering just below .05 with absence of values just above\n- Post-data collection modification of preregistration changing key criteria and outcomes\n- Progressive participant exclusions that could represent strategic manipulation\n\n**Critical analysis:**\nThe p-value pattern and preregistration modification are particularly damning. The p-value clustering is a well-established statistical fingerprint of data manipulation that's nearly impossible to occur naturally. The preregistration modification after data collection represents a fundamental violation of research integrity that's very difficult to explain innocently.\n\nWhile the technical issues and lab practices provide plausible explanations for some suspicious elements, they don't address the core statistical anomalies. Someone with a clean track record could still commit situational misconduct under extreme pressure.\n\nThe combination of the unnatural p-value distribution and retrospective preregistration changes creates a pattern that, while individually explicable, becomes highly suspicious collectively. These represent the most objective and difficult-to-fabricate pieces of evidence in the case.\n\nThe weight of the statistical forensic evidence outweighs the mitigating factors.\n\n75"

The concentration of p-values just below .05 with virtually none just above, combined with the post-data collection modification of preregistration documents changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, creates a pattern that is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices alone.\n\nWhile Lena has mitigating factors (clean track record, documented technical issues, lab-wide protocols), these core statistical and procedural anomalies represent well-established signatures of research misconduct that transcend individual circumstances or institutional practices."
