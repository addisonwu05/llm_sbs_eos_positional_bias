The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

For multiple previous studies to pass such scrutiny and receive positive ratings for documentation and reproducibility suggests a pattern of careful, systematic research conduct.\n\nIf Lena is indeed an honest researcher (the premise of the question), then her having this positive track record would be quite expected and consistent.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to weigh all the evidence systematically.\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection** - This is a serious red flag. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-hoc directly undermines research integrity and enables results-driven analysis.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution** - The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Pressure and motivation** - Lena's emails expressing that she \"needs this one to work\" and describing career-threatening consequences establish clear motive for misconduct.\n\n4. **Progressive participant exclusions** - Earlier scripts including more participants, combined with the modified preregistration, suggests potential results-driven exclusions.\n\n**Evidence that could be innocent:**\n\n1. **Strong previous record** - Passing independent data audits with positive ratings suggests established good practices, though this could represent escalating misconduct under increased pressure.\n\n2. **Lab-wide robustness testing** - Multiple analysis scripts are explained by lab policy, though this could also provide cover for manipulation.\n\n3. **Technical issues** - Software switches and hard drive failures are mundane explanations for some irregularities, though they don't explain the most concerning patterns.\n\n4. **Legitimate participant exclusions** - The two documented exclusions (sleeping, confusion) appear properly documented and justified.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\nThe combination of modified preregistration + suspicious p-value clustering + clear pressure/motive creates a very concerning pattern. While individual pieces might have innocent explanations, the constellation of evidence points toward systematic misconduct. The preregistration modifications and p-value patterns are particularly damning as they represent direct violations of research integrity that are difficult to explain innocently.\n\nThe technical issues and previous good record provide some mitigation, but they don't address the core statistical and procedural irregularities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence suggests a pattern of results-driven research practices that cross the line into misconduct, likely driven by extreme career pressure.\n\n75"
