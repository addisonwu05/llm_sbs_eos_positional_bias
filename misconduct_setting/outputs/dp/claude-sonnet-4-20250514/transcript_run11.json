The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

These are classic examples of legitimate exclusion criteria because:\n\n1. **Sleeping participants** cannot meaningfully perform cognitive tasks, making their data invalid for testing memory theories\n2. **Participants who don't understand instructions** cannot be said to be performing the intended task, so their data doesn't address the research question\n3. **Pre-registered exclusions** are common practice - researchers typically establish exclusion criteria before data collection begins\n\nThe fact that these exclusions were documented in notes that predate the journal submission is particularly important evidence supporting legitimacy. This timing suggests the exclusions were made during or shortly after data collection, not retroactively to improve results.\n\nIn a study of 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5%) excluded for these reasons falls well within the normal range. Most cognitive studies expect to exclude 5-15% of participants for various legitimate reasons including technical failures, participant non-compliance, or failure to understand instructions.\n\nThe documentation and timing of these exclusions actually supports rather than undermines Lena's credibility. If she were fabricating data or manipulating results, she would be unlikely to create a paper trail showing legitimate exclusions that predate submission.\n\nThis evidence pattern - standard exclusion criteria, appropriate documentation, reasonable exclusion rate, and proper timing - is exactly what we would expect to see in legitimate, well-conducted research.\n\n85"

More commonly, researchers might manipulate some analyses, exclude certain participants post-hoc for illegitimate reasons, or alter specific data points while leaving other legitimate procedures intact.\n\n2. **Partial legitimacy** - Lena could have genuinely encountered participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions (this happens routinely in cognitive studies), documented these legitimate exclusions properly, but then committed misconduct in other ways (e.g., manipulating the remaining data, changing analyses, or making additional illegitimate exclusions).\n\n3. **Strategic considerations** - If fabricating exclusions, a researcher would more likely create reasons that are harder to verify or that more directly benefit their hypothesis. \"Fell asleep\" and \"didn't understand instructions\" are basic, easily verifiable exclusions that don't specifically favor particular theoretical predictions.\n\n4. **Documentation habits** - Someone who commits misconduct might still maintain some legitimate research practices, especially early in data collection before pressure mounted or before deciding to manipulate results.\n\n5. **Timeline factors** - The misconduct might have occurred later in the process (during analysis or revision phases) while initial data collection and basic exclusions remained legitimate.\n\nThe pre-dating of notes actually supports the legitimacy of these specific exclusions, even if other aspects of the research involved misconduct.\n\n70"

Researchers routinely test whether their findings hold under different assumptions about data quality and participant inclusion.\n\n2. **Lab-wide initiative** - The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" indicates this was an institutionally encouraged practice, not something Lena was doing in isolation. This suggests proper methodological training and supervision.\n\n3. **Consistent patterns across students** - The observation that other students show similar patterns strongly supports that this is standard lab protocol rather than suspicious behavior. If multiple students independently developed the same analysis approach, it indicates normal research practices.\n\n4. **Transparent documentation** - The fact that these scripts were stored and logged (rather than hidden or deleted) demonstrates good research practices and transparency. Someone engaged in misconduct would be more likely to conceal alternative analyses that didn't support their preferred outcome.\n\n5. **Modern research standards** - Contemporary research emphasizes transparency, robustness testing, and sensitivity analyses. Many journals now require or encourage researchers to show that findings are stable across different analytical choices.\n\n6. **Legitimate exploration** - Testing different exclusion criteria (stricter vs. looser) helps researchers understand the boundaries and stability of their effects, which is scientifically valuable regardless of the specific outcomes.\n\nThis pattern is exactly what we would expect to see in a well-run, methodologically rigorous lab following current best practices in reproducible research.\n\n92"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, finding earlier analysis scripts with additional participants who were later excluded would be very likely for several reasons:\n\n1. **Post-hoc exclusion strategy** - Someone engaged in misconduct would likely run initial analyses with all participants, see unfavorable results, then retroactively exclude participants whose data weakened the desired findings.\n\n2. **Iterative result optimization** - The pattern suggests potential \"fishing\" behavior: running analyses, seeing which participants hurt the results, then finding justifications to exclude them in subsequent versions.\n\n3. **Automated backup evidence** - The fact that automated backups captured these earlier versions suggests Lena may not have realized this evidence trail existed, making it harder to conceal the progression from weaker to stronger results.\n\n4. **Result-driven exclusions** - Rather than excluding participants based on pre-established quality criteria, misconduct would involve excluding participants specifically because their data didn't support the hypothesis.\n\n5. **Progressive strengthening pattern** - If the results became progressively stronger with each round of exclusions, this would suggest data manipulation rather than legitimate quality control.\n\n6. **Timing with other evidence** - Combined with the suspicious p-value clustering and post-hoc preregistration changes, this pattern fits a broader picture of result manipulation.\n\n7. **Selective exclusion targeting** - Misconduct would involve specifically identifying and removing participants whose data weakened statistical significance, which would naturally create this progression from larger to smaller datasets.\n\nThis evidence trail of progressive participant exclusion aligns strongly with systematic result manipulation.\n\n85"

    "content": "Yes.\n\nThe evidence points to academic misconduct despite some mitigating factors. The combination of post-data collection preregistration modifications, the highly suspicious p-value clustering pattern that is virtually impossible to occur naturally, and the progressive participant exclusions across analysis versions creates a compelling case for intentional data manipulation. While Lena had technical difficulties and a previously clean record, these cannot adequately explain the statistical signatures that are characteristic hallmarks of research misconduct, particularly the p-value distribution which represents one of the strongest indicators of data manipulation in research integrity investigations."
