  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly points toward academic misconduct. While some individual pieces of evidence have innocent explanations, the combination of modified preregistration after data collection and the highly suspicious p-value distribution (clustering just below .05 with almost no values just above) represents a pattern that is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices alone.\n\nThese two factors together - post-hoc changes to planned analyses and statistical signatures consistent with p-hacking - constitute the kind of evidence that research integrity investigations typically find compelling. The documented pressure and multiple opportunities for manipulation provide a plausible mechanism and motive.\n\nWhile Lena's previous good record gives me pause, the core statistical and procedural evidence suggests that in this particular high-stakes situation, she likely crossed ethical boundaries to ensure the study would \"work\" as she felt it needed to."
