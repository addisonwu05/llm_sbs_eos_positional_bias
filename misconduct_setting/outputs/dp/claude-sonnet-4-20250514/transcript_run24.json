The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this specific piece of evidence, the exclusion of two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions appears entirely consistent with standard research practices.\n\nSeveral factors make this exclusion highly expected if no misconduct occurred:\n\n**Standard research protocols**: Virtually all cognitive neuroscience studies have pre-specified exclusion criteria that include participants who fall asleep during tasks or fail to understand instructions. These are fundamental threats to data validity that any competent researcher would exclude.\n\n**Documentation timing**: The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission is exactly what we'd expect in legitimate research. Researchers typically document exclusions immediately when they occur or shortly after data collection, not during analysis or manuscript preparation.\n\n**Reasonable exclusion rate**: Two exclusions out of 80 participants (2.5%) is well within the normal range for cognitive studies. If anything, this rate seems conservative - many studies report higher exclusion rates.\n\n**Clear justification**: Both exclusion reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) represent objective, easily verifiable criteria that would be obvious to any researcher conducting the study.\n\n**Professional competence**: Even if we assume Lena were engaging in misconduct elsewhere, she would still be expected to exclude obviously invalid participants like those who fell asleep, as including such data would be scientifically indefensible.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentation and standard nature of these exclusions strongly suggest normal research practice rather than post-hoc manipulation.\n\n90"

Excluding participants who obviously shouldn't be included (those who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions) helps maintain this facade.\n\n**Mixed misconduct patterns**: Academic misconduct rarely involves fabricating every aspect of a study. More commonly, researchers might manipulate some analyses, selectively report results, or alter specific data points while keeping other legitimate practices intact. Valid exclusions would likely remain valid.\n\n**Professional competence remains**: Even researchers who engage in misconduct typically retain their basic methodological knowledge. Lena would still recognize that including data from participants who fell asleep would be indefensible and potentially expose her to scrutiny.\n\n**Documentation as protection**: Creating contemporaneous notes about obvious exclusions serves as protective documentation that demonstrates awareness of proper procedures, making other aspects of the research appear more credible.\n\n**Risk management**: Including obviously invalid participants would create unnecessary vulnerability to criticism and could draw attention to the dataset in ways that might expose other irregularities.\n\n**Standard practice persistence**: These exclusions represent such fundamental research hygiene that they would likely occur automatically, regardless of other questionable practices.\n\nThe strategic value of maintaining legitimate exclusion practices, combined with basic research competence, makes this outcome highly probable even under misconduct.\n\n85"

If multiple researchers independently engaged in the same questionable practices, it would suggest either widespread misconduct (unlikely) or legitimate methodology (much more likely).\n\n**Contemporary methodological emphasis**: The scientific community increasingly emphasizes robustness checks, sensitivity analyses, and transparency about analytical flexibility. Many journals now expect or require such analyses.\n\n**Documented transparency**: Storing multiple scripts in official data management logs demonstrates openness rather than concealment - misconduct would more likely involve hidden or deleted analyses.\n\n**Graduate training context**: PhD students are typically encouraged to explore different analytical approaches as part of their methodological training, especially in a supportive lab environment.\n\nThis pattern perfectly aligns with current best practices in rigorous, transparent research methodology.\n\n95"

These are both objective indicators that align with documented misconduct patterns and are difficult to explain through honest error or normal research variation.\n\nHowever, the strong prior record and verified legitimate practices create some reasonable doubt about intentional misconduct versus serious procedural errors.\n\n72"

    "content": "Yes.\n\nThe combination of two key pieces of objective evidence makes misconduct more likely than not:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modification**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles that is extremely difficult to justify as innocent error.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of results just below .05 with almost none just above creates a statistical signature highly characteristic of data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's prior clean record and many legitimate research practices create some doubt, these two pieces of digital evidence suggest systematic rather than coincidental problems. The preregistration modifications in particular indicate deliberate post-hoc optimization of results rather than honest analytical decisions.\n\nThe pressure context (grant renewal, career stakes) provides clear motive, and the technical competence demonstrated in her prior work shows she would have the skills to execute sophisticated misconduct while maintaining some legitimate practices as cover.\n\nThough this is a difficult case with mixed evidence, the objective indicators of result manipulation outweigh the mitigating factors."
