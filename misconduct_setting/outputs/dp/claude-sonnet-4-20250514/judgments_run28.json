  "Yes.\n\nThe evidence strongly indicates that Lena committed academic misconduct. The combination of post-hoc modifications to the preregistration document after data collection and the highly suspicious p-value distribution (clustering just below .05 with virtually none just above .05) constitutes compelling statistical and procedural evidence of systematic result manipulation. These patterns are extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices and represent classic signatures of p-hacking and questionable research practices. While individual pieces of evidence might have innocent explanations, their convergence - particularly the objective digital evidence of preregistration tampering and unnatural statistical patterns - creates an overwhelming case for misconduct."
