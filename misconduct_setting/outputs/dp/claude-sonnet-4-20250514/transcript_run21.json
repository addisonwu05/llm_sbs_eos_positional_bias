The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this evidence would be very likely to occur for several legitimate reasons:\n\n1. **Normal iterative process**: Data analysis is inherently iterative. Researchers routinely start with larger datasets and refine their samples as they identify issues, apply quality checks, and implement proper exclusion criteria.\n\n2. **Progressive quality control**: It's standard practice to begin analysis with all collected data, then systematically exclude participants based on predetermined criteria like:\n   - Incomplete responses\n   - Failed attention checks\n   - Technical problems during data collection\n   - Statistical outliers\n   - Protocol violations\n\n3. **Discovery of issues over time**: Problems with participants often become apparent only after closer examination of the data, leading to legitimate post-hoc exclusions that weren't initially obvious.\n\n4. **Automated backup captures process**: The fact that this earlier version was found in automated backups (rather than being deliberately hidden) suggests normal workflow documentation rather than misconduct concealment.\n\n5. **Transparent workflow**: Legitimate researchers often keep multiple versions of scripts as they refine their analyses, and having these preserved in backups demonstrates normal, transparent research practices.\n\n6. **Expected in cognitive research**: Given that participants reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions (as mentioned earlier), it's entirely normal that additional participants might have been excluded for similar reasons discovered during analysis.\n\n7. **Documentation trail**: Having a clear trail from initial to final dataset actually suggests careful, methodical research practices rather than misconduct.\n\nThis represents exactly what we'd expect from careful, legitimate research where data quality is properly assessed and maintained.\n\n85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, this evidence would be extremely likely to occur for several reasons:\n\n1. **Strategic participant removal**: If engaging in misconduct, Lena would likely start with all participants and then systematically remove those whose data weakened her desired results. This would naturally create a trail from larger to smaller datasets.\n\n2. **P-hacking through exclusions**: Given the suspicious p-value clustering just below .05, removing additional participants could be part of a strategy to push borderline results into significance by eliminating data points that hurt the statistical outcomes.\n\n3. **Iterative manipulation process**: Misconduct often involves testing different combinations of participants to see which subset produces the best results, naturally creating multiple script versions with different sample sizes.\n\n4. **Post-hoc rationalization**: After identifying which participants to exclude for optimal results, she could then create post-hoc justifications for these exclusions (potentially explaining the preregistration modifications).\n\n5. **Automated backup reveals process**: The fact this was found in automated backups suggests she may not have realized this evidence of her process was being preserved, making it more likely to reflect actual misconduct rather than fabricated evidence.\n\n6. **Fits overall pattern**: This aligns with other evidence suggesting systematic manipulation - modifying preregistration, suspicious p-values, and high pressure to succeed all point toward strategic data manipulation.\n\n7. **Selective exclusion strategy**: Rather than fabricating entirely new data, selectively removing problematic participants is a more sophisticated and harder-to-detect form of misconduct.\n\nThis represents exactly the kind of iterative manipulation process that would be expected in systematic research misconduct.\n\n88"

The p-value clustering pattern has very low probability of occurring naturally (I estimated 15% if innocent, 92% if misconduct)\n2. Post-hoc preregistration modification is a severe methodological violation (I estimated 8% if innocent, 95% if misconduct)\n3. The combination of extreme pressure, suspicious statistical patterns, and procedural violations creates a compelling circumstantial case\n\nWhile the prior good record suggests this might represent situational misconduct under extreme pressure rather than a pattern of dishonesty, the statistical and procedural evidence is quite damning.\n\nThe convergence of multiple red flags - particularly the objective statistical and timestamp evidence - outweighs the mitigating factors.\n\n78"

The convergence of these multiple red flags - particularly evidence that doesn't rely on subjective interpretation - points toward misconduct occurring under extreme situational pressure."
