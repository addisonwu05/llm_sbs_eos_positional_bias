The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this specific piece of evidence, I need to consider how common it is for participants to fall asleep or not understand instructions in cognitive neuroscience studies, and whether it's standard practice to document and exclude such participants.\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience experiments, especially those involving memory tasks, it's quite common for some participants to have issues that compromise data quality. Studies typically run for extended periods, tasks can be monotonous or cognitively demanding, and participants may have varying levels of attention or comprehension. A 2.5% exclusion rate (2 out of 80 participants) for such issues is actually quite reasonable and conservative.\n\nStandard research practice involves:\n- Taking detailed notes during data collection about participant behavior and compliance\n- Making exclusion decisions based on pre-established criteria\n- Documenting these decisions contemporaneously, not retroactively\n- The fact that exclusion notes predate submission is exactly what we'd expect in legitimate research\n\nIf Lena were fabricating or manipulating data, there would be much more efficient ways to improve results than excluding just 2 participants for common, legitimate reasons. Someone engaging in misconduct would be more likely to:\n- Exclude many more participants to dramatically improve effect sizes\n- Make up more technical or sophisticated-sounding exclusion criteria\n- Potentially alter the actual data rather than just exclude problematic participants\n\nThe specific nature of these exclusions (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) represents exactly the kind of mundane but important data quality issues that researchers routinely encounter and document. The contemporaneous documentation actually supports rather than undermines the legitimacy of these exclusions.\n\nThis evidence is quite consistent with normal, ethical research practices and doesn't suggest misconduct.\n\n85"

More commonly, researchers might:\n\n- Collect real data but selectively manipulate or fabricate portions of it\n- Conduct legitimate data collection while making inappropriate analytical choices\n- Mix genuine procedural steps with fraudulent ones\n\nThe exclusion of participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions represents basic methodological hygiene that even someone committing misconduct would likely maintain because:\n\n1.

Robustness checks are a cornerstone of good scientific practice and involve testing whether findings hold under different reasonable analytical assumptions.\n\n**Standard robustness testing practices**: Running analyses with varying exclusion criteria (stricter vs. looser) is exactly what robustness testing entails. Researchers typically want to demonstrate that their findings aren't dependent on arbitrary analytical choices. This might include:\n- Testing different cutoffs for reaction time exclusions\n- Varying criteria for excluding outliers\n- Comparing results with and without borderline participants\n- Sensitivity analyses across different reasonable methodological choices\n\n**Institutional best practices**: Many labs and institutions now actively encourage or require robustness testing and sensitivity analyses as part of good research practice, especially in response to the replication crisis in psychology and neuroscience.\n\n**Systematic documentation**: The fact that these scripts were properly logged and stored (rather than hidden) suggests transparent, legitimate methodological exploration. Someone engaging in misconduct would be less likely to systematically document questionable practices.\n\n**Consistency across lab members**: The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this being standard lab practice rather than individual misconduct.

Initial scripts often include all collected data before quality control measures are implemented.\n\n**Iterative data cleaning process**: Legitimate data analysis typically involves multiple stages:\n- Initial inclusion of all participants\n- Application of pre-planned exclusion criteria\n- Discovery of additional data quality issues requiring further exclusions\n- Refinement of analysis as problems are identified\n\n**Quality control discoveries**: During analysis, researchers commonly discover issues not apparent during initial data collection (e.g., technical problems, participant non-compliance, data corruption) that necessitate additional exclusions.\n\n**Automated backup documentation**: The fact that this earlier version was recovered from automated backup (rather than being deliberately preserved) suggests normal workflow documentation rather than suspicious activity.\n\n**Pre-planned exclusion implementation**: Even if exclusion criteria were pre-registered, they're typically implemented after initial data collection and preliminary analysis, meaning earlier scripts would naturally include more participants.\n\n**Collaborative review process**: Lab members or supervisors might review initial analyses and suggest additional exclusions based on data quality concerns.\n\n**Software transition context**: Given the mentioned software switch, earlier scripts might reflect different analytical approaches or participant inclusion criteria that were later refined.\n\nThis represents exactly the kind of iterative refinement process that characterizes careful, legitimate data analysis.\n\n87"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, finding an earlier analysis script with more participants who were later excluded would be very likely and could represent evidence of systematic data manipulation.\n\nSeveral factors make this pattern highly probable in a misconduct scenario:\n\n**P-hacking through exclusions**: Given the suspicious p-value distribution (clustered just below .05), the participant exclusions could represent iterative removal of participants whose data weakened the desired results. Someone engaging in misconduct would systematically exclude participants until achieving statistical significance.\n\n**Post-hoc rationalization**: The earlier script might show the original, legitimate dataset before misconduct occurred. Later exclusions could be fabricated justifications for removing inconvenient data points, especially if exclusion criteria were modified post-hoc in the preregistration.\n\n**Trial-and-error manipulation**: The automated backup captures evidence of the manipulation process - showing how the dataset was progressively modified to improve results. Each iteration would exclude more participants until the desired statistical outcomes were achieved.\n\n**Selective data removal**: Rather than fabricating entirely new data, it's often easier and less detectable to selectively remove real participants whose responses don't support the hypothesis.\n\n**Cover-up attempts**: The final exclusions might be attempts to eliminate participants whose data would reveal inconsistencies or fabrication in the remaining dataset.\n\n**Systematic optimization**: Combined with multiple analysis scripts and modified preregistration, this suggests a coordinated effort to optimize results through multiple mechanisms including strategic participant removal.\n\n**Forensic evidence**: The automated backup inadvertently preserved evidence of the manipulation process that might otherwise have been deleted.\n\nThis pattern fits perfectly with systematic data manipulation to achieve desired statistical outcomes.\n\n89"

These patterns are specifically designed to be detected as misconduct indicators, and both appearing together in the same study makes coincidence highly unlikely.\n\nThe procedural violations (preregistration modification) combined with statistical anomalies (p-value clustering) create a compelling case that transcends individual pieces of ambiguous evidence.\n\n78"
