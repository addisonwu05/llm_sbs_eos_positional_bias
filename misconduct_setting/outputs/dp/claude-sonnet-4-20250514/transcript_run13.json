The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

These directly compromise data quality and validity.\n\n2. **Proper documentation timing**: The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission is exactly what we'd expect from proper research practice. Researchers typically document exclusions immediately when they occur or during initial data processing, well before manuscript preparation.\n\n3. **Standard practice**: With 80 participants, having 2 excluded for these reasons (2.5% exclusion rate) is quite reasonable and typical for cognitive studies. Many studies report exclusion rates of 5-15% or higher.\n\n4. **Documentation consistency**: The presence of contemporaneous notes in raw data files suggests proper research workflow - documenting issues as they arise rather than retroactively justifying exclusions.\n\n5. **Field expectations**: Any competent researcher in cognitive neuroscience would know to exclude such participants, and any proper research protocol would include these as pre-planned exclusion criteria.\n\nThe combination of appropriate exclusion reasons, proper timing of documentation, reasonable exclusion rate, and standard research practice makes this evidence highly consistent with legitimate research conduct.\n\n95"

Even researchers who manipulate data often handle many elements legitimately. Lena could have genuinely encountered participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions.\n\n2. **Strategic authenticity**: If Lena were sophisticated enough to manipulate data while avoiding detection, she would likely maintain legitimate documentation for straightforward, defensible exclusions.

Participant exclusions for obvious reasons like falling asleep are low-risk, standard practices that wouldn't need manipulation.\n\n4. **Timeline considerations**: These exclusions predate submission, so if misconduct occurred later (e.g., during revision process after reviewer comments, as suggested by the whistleblower), these early exclusions could be entirely legitimate.\n\n5. **Risk-benefit calculation**: Fabricating unnecessary participant exclusions would add risk without benefit - these exclusions are easily justifiable and expected, so there would be no reason to fake them.\n\n6. **Maintaining plausibility**: Someone committing misconduct would likely ensure that routine, easily-verified aspects of their research appear completely normal.\n\nEven if Lena committed misconduct in other aspects of the study, these particular exclusions would likely still be genuine and properly documented.\n\n78"

It's considered best practice to test whether findings hold under stricter or more lenient exclusion rules to assess the robustness of results.\n\n2. **Lab-wide implementation**: The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push\" and that \"other students show similar patterns\" strongly indicates this was an organized, systematic approach to improving research quality rather than individual data manipulation.\n\n3. **Transparency and documentation**: Legitimate researchers document their analytical choices and alternatives. The fact that these scripts are stored and logged (rather than hidden or deleted) suggests proper research workflow and transparency.\n\n4. **Current best practices**: Modern research emphasizes analytical transparency, robustness checks, and sensitivity analyses.

Mid-project switches, while disruptive, are not unusual - especially in multi-year PhD projects where priorities and tools evolve.\n\n2. **Hardware failures are routine**: Laptop hard drive failures are common technical issues, particularly with the heavy computational demands of data analysis.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it would be very likely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with very few just above .05.\n\nSeveral factors make this pattern highly probable with misconduct:\n\n1. **Classic p-hacking signature**: This distribution is a textbook indicator of \"p-hacking\" - manipulating analyses until achieving statistical significance. Someone engaging in misconduct would likely keep testing variations until getting p < .05, then stop.\n\n2. **Selective reporting**: If Lena ran multiple analyses (as evidenced by the various scripts), she could selectively report only those that achieved significance while suppressing near-misses just above .05.\n\n3. **Strategic data manipulation**: Various forms of misconduct (selective exclusions, optional stopping, analytical flexibility) would naturally produce this pattern as the researcher fine-tunes results to cross the significance threshold.\n\n4. **Pressure-driven behavior**: Given her emails about needing the study \"to work\" and career pressures, Lena would be highly motivated to achieve statistical significance at any cost, leading to this exact pattern.\n\n5. **Exploratory analysis flexibility**: The context of \"several exploratory analyses\" provides numerous opportunities for manipulation - testing different variables, subgroups, or analytical approaches until finding significant results.\n\n6. **Sophisticated misconduct**: Someone knowledgeable enough to manipulate data would understand the importance of the .05 threshold and focus efforts on crossing it.\n\n7. **Multiple analysis coordination**: The pattern appearing across several analyses suggests systematic rather than random manipulation.\n\nThis distribution is precisely what statistical experts look for when investigating potential research misconduct.\n\n92"

The preregistration modifications after data collection (which I rated as only 25% likely if innocent)\n2. The suspicious p-value clustering (which I rated as only 25% likely if innocent)  \n3. The clear motive established in the emails\n\nWhile the technical issues and prior good record provide some mitigation, the preregistration tampering and p-value pattern represent serious red flags that are very difficult to explain through innocent means. The pressure documented in her emails provides a plausible psychological pathway to misconduct.\n\nThe confluence of statistical anomalies, procedural violations, and documented pressure creates a compelling case for misconduct, despite some legitimately explained elements.\n\n75"

Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. An unusually suspicious distribution of p-values clustered just below .05 across multiple exploratory analyses\n3. Clear documentation of intense pressure and career desperation\n\nThese three pieces of evidence represent serious departures from research integrity that are very difficult to explain through innocent means. While some aspects of the case (technical issues, prior good record, some legitimate exclusions) support Lena's innocence, the core statistical and procedural violations point strongly toward misconduct.\n\nThe preregistration tampering alone is a fundamental violation of scientific methodology, and when combined with the telltale p-hacking signature in the results, it suggests systematic manipulation rather than honest research practices."
