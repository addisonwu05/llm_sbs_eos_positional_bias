The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Lena might have been honest in her earlier work but turned to misconduct only under the current pressure situation (high-profile study, supervisor pressure, major grant review). Many documented cases show researchers with clean records who later engage in misconduct.\n\n2. **Escalation under pressure**: The current study involves much higher stakes - a \"high-profile experiment\" with Professor Mills \"under pressure\" for a major grant review. Previous studies may have been lower-pressure situations where Lena had no motivation to fabricate data.\n\n3. **Learning curve of misconduct**: If someone is going to engage in research fraud, they might be more likely to attempt it on studies they consider most critical, while maintaining honest practices on routine work.\n\n4. **Compartmentalization**: Some individuals can maintain high standards in most areas while engaging in misconduct in specific high-stakes situations, especially when external pressures mount.\n\nHowever, several factors work against this:\n- Independent audits are thorough and would catch sophisticated manipulation\n- Research integrity tends to be either a consistent value or not\n- Building skills and reputation through legitimate means makes later fraud seem less necessary\n- The comprehensive nature of the prior evaluation (raw data + scripts) suggests genuine competence\n\nThe strong prior track record does create some tension with the misconduct hypothesis, but isn't incompatible with it given the changed circumstances and pressures.\n\n35"

These are textbook examples of legitimate exclusions that any responsible researcher would make.\n\n2. **Pre-registered timing**: The notes predating journal submission is exactly what we'd expect from honest research.

    "content": "Looking at this evidence under the hypothesis that Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct, I need to evaluate how likely it would be for an honest researcher to have earlier scripts with more participants that were later excluded.\n\nSeveral factors suggest this would be very likely with honest research:\n\n1. **Standard iterative process**: Data analysis is typically an iterative process where researchers start with the full dataset and progressively apply exclusion criteria as they identify problems or issues. Having earlier versions with more participants is completely normal workflow.\n\n2. **Quality control discovery**: As researchers examine their data more carefully, they often discover additional reasons for exclusions that weren't immediately apparent - participants who didn't follow instructions, had technical issues, or showed signs of inattention that only became clear during detailed analysis.\n\n3. **Legitimate analytical refinement**: Initial analysis scripts often include all collected data, with exclusions applied in subsequent versions as researchers implement their planned exclusion criteria more systematically or discover data quality issues.\n\n4. **Automated backup evidence**: The fact that this comes from an automated backup actually supports legitimacy - it shows natural workflow progression rather than deliberate manipulation, since automated systems capture the genuine sequence of work.\n\n5. **Transparent documentation**: Having multiple script versions preserved (rather than deleted) suggests normal research practices with proper version control, not attempts to hide anything.\n\n6. **Common graduate student workflow**: PhD students often start analyses inclusively and then apply exclusions as they learn more about their data quality and as supervisors provide feedback on methodology.\n\n7. **Standard research practice**: Moving from larger to smaller samples through systematic exclusions represents careful, methodical research rather than suspicious behavior.\n\nThis progression from more to fewer participants across script versions reflects normal, careful research methodology.\n\n85"

The earlier script with more participants could represent the stage before strategic exclusions were applied.\n\n2. **Iterative manipulation**: Someone engaging in fraud might run multiple versions, progressively removing participants until achieving the desired statistical significance. The automated backup captured this process in action.\n\n3. **P-hacking through exclusions**: Given the suspicious p-value distribution (many just below .05), the exclusions between script versions could represent efforts to nudge non-significant results into significance by removing inconvenient data points.\n\n4. **Post-hoc justification**: After identifying which participants to exclude for statistical reasons, she could then create seemingly legitimate post-hoc justifications for their removal (the sleep/confusion notes mentioned earlier).\n\n5. **Maintaining plausible workflow**: Even with misconduct, the general pattern of starting inclusive and becoming exclusive mirrors normal research workflow, providing cover for strategic exclusions.\n\n6. **Pressure-driven optimization**: Given the established pressure and stakes, there would be strong motivation to systematically refine the dataset until achieving publishable results.\n\nHowever, some factors work against this interpretation:\n- Normal research also follows this pattern\n- The progression itself isn't inherently suspicious\n- Legitimate exclusions would create the same artifact\n\nThe pattern is consistent with misconduct but doesn't uniquely indicate it, since honest research follows similar workflows.\n\n75"

While individual pieces of evidence have alternative explanations, their convergence is concerning, especially given the established motive and pressure.\n\n75"

The p-value distribution showing concentration just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical fingerprint of data manipulation\n2. The post-data collection modification of preregistration (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) represents a serious methodological breach that directly enables result manipulation\n3. The established intense pressure and desperation provides clear motive\n4. The pattern of evidence is more consistent with sophisticated misconduct that maintains some appearance of legitimacy rather than outright fabrication\n\nWhile Lena's strong prior record argues for her character, and some evidence has innocent explanations, the statistical anomalies and procedural violations are difficult to explain through honest mistakes or normal research practices. The combination of these factors, particularly the objective statistical and timestamp evidence, tips the balance toward misconduct despite the mitigating factors."
