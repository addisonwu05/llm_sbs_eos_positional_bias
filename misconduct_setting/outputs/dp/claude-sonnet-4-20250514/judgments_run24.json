  "Yes.\n\nThe combination of two key pieces of objective evidence makes misconduct more likely than not:\n\n1. **Post-hoc preregistration modification**: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents a fundamental violation of research integrity principles that is extremely difficult to justify as innocent error.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution**: The clustering of results just below .05 with almost none just above creates a statistical signature highly characteristic of data manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's prior clean record and many legitimate research practices create some doubt, these two pieces of digital evidence suggest systematic rather than coincidental problems. The preregistration modifications in particular indicate deliberate post-hoc optimization of results rather than honest analytical decisions.\n\nThe pressure context (grant renewal, career stakes) provides clear motive, and the technical competence demonstrated in her prior work shows she would have the skills to execute sophisticated misconduct while maintaining some legitimate practices as cover.\n\nThough this is a difficult case with mixed evidence, the objective indicators of result manipulation outweigh the mitigating factors."
