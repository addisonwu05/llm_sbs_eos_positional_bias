The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this specific piece of evidence, I need to consider how common it is for participants to fall asleep or not understand instructions in cognitive neuroscience experiments, and whether it's standard practice to document and exclude such participants.\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience studies, particularly those involving memory tasks:\n\n1. **Participant issues are common**: It's quite typical for some participants to have problems during experiments. Memory tasks can be lengthy, monotonous, or cognitively demanding, making it reasonable that participants might fall asleep or become confused about instructions.\n\n2. **Standard exclusion criteria**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or don't understand the task is not only reasonable but represents good scientific practice. These participants' data would likely be invalid and could introduce noise that obscures real effects.\n\n3. **Documentation timing**: Good research practices require real-time documentation of any issues during data collection. Researchers typically take notes during or immediately after each session, well before any data analysis or journal submission occurs.\n\n4. **Proportion is reasonable**: With 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5%) experience these issues falls within the typical range of exclusions in behavioral studies, which commonly exclude 5-15% of participants for various reasons.\n\n5. **Pre-submission timing**: The fact that these exclusions were documented before journal submission actually supports proper methodology rather than post-hoc data manipulation.\n\nThis evidence pattern is entirely consistent with normal, ethical research conduct. The exclusions are based on legitimate methodological grounds, were documented contemporaneously, and represent a reasonable proportion of the sample.\n\n85"

Several factors make these exclusions probable even under misconduct:\n\n1. **Maintaining plausibility**: Someone fabricating data would want the dataset to look realistic. Excluding some participants for common, believable reasons (falling asleep, confusion) actually helps create a more convincing fabricated dataset than having a \"perfect\" sample with zero exclusions.\n\n2. **Standard practice mimicry**: An experienced PhD student would know that participant exclusions are expected and normal. Including such exclusions demonstrates apparent adherence to proper methodology.\n\n3. **Pre-submission documentation**: If Lena were sophisticated enough to engage in misconduct, she would likely be smart enough to create documentation that appears to follow proper timeline and procedures. Backdating notes or creating contemporaneous-looking documentation would be part of covering tracks.\n\n4. **Reasonable proportion**: Excluding exactly 2 participants (2.5%) strikes a balance - enough to look realistic but not so many as to raise questions about data quality or waste resources.\n\n5. **Deflects suspicion**: Having legitimate-seeming exclusions with proper documentation actually provides cover, making the overall dataset appear more credible and methodologically sound.\n\n6. **Mixed evidence scenario**: The case describes some suspicious patterns alongside mundane explanations. Strategic inclusion of normal-looking elements (like standard exclusions) fits this pattern of mixed signals.\n\nSomeone committing misconduct would likely still include such realistic, well-documented exclusions as part of creating a convincing fabricated study.\n\n75"

New versions are released, licenses expire, better alternatives become available, or institutional requirements change.\n2. **Timing factors**: PhD projects span years, making mid-project software changes almost inevitable. Labs often upgrade during natural break points or when facing compatibility issues.\n3. **Cognitive neuroscience context**: This field uses specialized software that evolves rapidly, making switches particularly common as new analysis methods emerge.\n\n**Hard drive failures:**\n1. **Hardware reliability**: Laptop hard drives have well-documented failure rates, typically 2-5% annually. Over the course of a multi-year PhD project, hardware failures are quite common.\n2. **Graduate student equipment**: PhD students often use older or heavily-used equipment that's more prone to failure.\n3. **IT confirmation**: The fact that IT departments maintain records of hardware repairs and can confirm the timing adds credibility and shows this follows normal institutional processes.\n\n**Combined probability:**\nWhile each event individually is quite plausible, having both occur in the same project might seem coincidental. However:\n- PhD projects typically span 2-3 years, providing ample opportunity for both events\n- These are independent events with relatively common base rates\n- The timing and documentation align with normal institutional processes\n- Both events are external to Lena's direct control\n\nThese circumstances, while potentially inconvenient for record-keeping, represent normal challenges that researchers commonly face during long-term projects.\n\n78"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, I need to evaluate how likely it would be for preregistration documents to be legitimately modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\n**Preregistration principles:**\n1. **Core purpose**: Preregistration exists specifically to prevent post-hoc changes driven by data outcomes. The entire point is to lock in analytical decisions before seeing results.\n\n2. **Timestamp significance**: File timestamps showing modifications after data collection directly contradict the fundamental concept of preregistration, which requires commitment to analytical plans before data examination.\n\n3. **What constitutes legitimate changes**: Acceptable post-data-collection modifications are extremely limited and typically involve:\n   - Correcting obvious errors or typos\n   - Clarifying ambiguous language without changing substance\n   - Adding purely technical details that don't affect interpretation\n\n**Problematic nature of described changes:**\n1. **Exclusion criteria changes**: Modifying exclusion criteria after data collection is particularly problematic because it directly affects which data points are analyzed - a core avenue for bias.\n\n2. **Primary outcome changes**: Changing primary outcomes after seeing data essentially constitutes HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known), which undermines the scientific validity of confirmatory analysis.\n\n3. **Legitimate research practice**: Honest researchers might discover implementation issues, but the proper response is transparency about deviations from preregistration, not secretly modifying the preregistered document.\n\n**Professional standards**: Current research integrity standards consider post-data modification of preregistrations to be a serious methodological violation, even if not technically fraud.\n\nThis behavior violates core principles of preregistration and represents poor research practice at minimum.\n\n8"

It's exactly what someone engaging in systematic data manipulation would do to legitimize their fabricated results.\n\nThis is among the most direct forms of research misconduct possible with preregistration systems.\n\n95"
