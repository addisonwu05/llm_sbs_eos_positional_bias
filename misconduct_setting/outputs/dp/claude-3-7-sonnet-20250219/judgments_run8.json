  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence pointing to misconduct includes:\n- The statistically suspicious distribution of p-values just below .05\n- The modification of preregistration documents after data collection\n- Evidence that exclusion criteria were altered between earlier and final analyses\n- Clear documentation of career pressure and motivation in her emails\n\nWhile some evidence (like her previously clean record) suggests she typically followed good practices, the specific pattern of irregularities in this high-stakes study strongly indicates that she engaged in problematic research practices for this particular project.\n\nThe modified preregistration is especially concerning, as this represents a fundamental violation of research transparency principles that would be extremely rare without intentional misconduct.\n\nYes"
