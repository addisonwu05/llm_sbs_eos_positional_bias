The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Participant attentiveness is crucial for valid data. A participant who falls asleep during the task cannot properly encode or retrieve memories being tested, making their data unusable for testing the theory.\n\n2. Understanding instructions is similarly essential. If participants misunderstand what they're supposed to do, their responses won't reflect the cognitive processes being studied.\n\n3. Documenting exclusions in raw data files before submission is standard practice in well-conducted research. Researchers typically note issues during data collection, not after analysis.\n\n4. Pre-registered exclusion criteria often specifically mention excluding participants who don't comply with task requirements or who can't complete procedures as intended.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, it's not only possible but actually quite likely that she would have legitimately excluded these participants and documented it properly. This is standard scientific practice to maintain data quality. The contemporaneous notes (predating submission) strongly suggest this was part of normal data cleaning rather than post-hoc manipulation to achieve desired results.\n\nThe fact that the exclusions were documented in real-time, before any journal submission, is particularly important evidence that this was legitimate scientific practice rather than data manipulation.\n\nProbability: 90"

Creating believable, detailed exclusion notes with appropriate timestamps would be a logical step for someone attempting to make fabricated data appear legitimate.\n\nThe timing is important - properly documented exclusions with contemporaneous notes represent good scientific practice. If Lena were fabricating data, she would likely want to create the appearance of proper procedure, including appropriate exclusion documentation.\n\nGiven these considerations, even if Lena committed misconduct in other aspects of the research, these particular exclusions with predating notes could still be legitimate or could be part of a comprehensive attempt to create a believable research record.\n\nProbability: 70"

Research misconduct often follows a progression:\n   - Researchers typically begin their careers following proper protocols\n   - Misconduct may develop gradually when facing challenges or pressure\n   - The independent audit occurred before such pressures intensified\n\n4. Scientific misconduct literature suggests that many researchers who engage in questionable practices have periods of proper scientific conduct in their history.\n\n5.

Exploratory analyses vulnerability:\n   - The fact that this appears in \"several exploratory analyses\" is particularly telling\n   - Exploratory analyses provide maximum flexibility for researchers to adjust parameters\n   - Without preregistration constraints, these analyses offer numerous opportunities to manipulate results\n   - Multiple showing the same suspicious pattern compounds the evidence of systematic manipulation\n\n3. Statistical implausibility:\n   - The mathematical probability of multiple p-values naturally clustering in the .041-.049 range is extremely low\n   - The unnatural \"gap\" or discontinuity just above the .05 threshold cannot be explained by chance\n   - This pattern directly contradicts how p-values should be distributed mathematically\n\n4. Methods of generating this pattern:\n   - This distribution typically results from specific misconduct practices:\n     * Running analyses repeatedly with slight variations until finding significance\n     * Selectively excluding participants until reaching p < .05\n     * Trying different statistical tests until finding significant results\n     * Only reporting analyses that reached significance\n\n5. Detection signature:\n   - This pattern is so strongly associated with misconduct that it has led to development of specific statistical tools to detect it\n   - Scientific journals and statisticians routinely flag this pattern as requiring additional scrutiny\n   - The pattern matches what would be produced if someone was deliberately manipulating analyses to achieve significance\n\nThis p-value distribution represents one of the most well-documented and recognized indicators of data manipulation in scientific research. If misconduct occurred, this is precisely the statistical footprint we would expect to see.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "To evaluate this question, I need to consider whether modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes could be consistent with ethical research practices.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern would be quite unlikely for these reasons:\n\n1. Fundamental purpose of preregistration:\n   - The entire point of preregistration is to document research plans before data collection\n   - Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data directly undermines this purpose\n   - This violates the core scientific principle of hypothesis testing preceding data analysis\n\n2. Standard research ethics:\n   - Changing exclusion criteria after data collection introduces researcher bias into the analysis\n   - Modifying primary outcomes after seeing results is generally considered unacceptable in scientific research\n   - Ethical researchers who need to deviate from preregistration typically document this transparently as an unplanned deviation\n\n3. Procedural expectations:\n   - Most preregistration platforms either prevent modifications after certain points or clearly mark them as amendments\n   - Proper procedure would be to note deviations from preregistration in the manuscript, not modify the preregistration\n   - File modification timestamps provide clear evidence of improper sequence\n\n4. Potential legitimate explanations:\n   - Very few scenarios would justify modifying a preregistration after data collection\n   - Any legitimate changes would typically be documented transparently as amendments\n   - Technical corrections or clarifications might occasionally occur, but changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes represents substantial modifications\n\n5. Severity of the modifications:\n   - The specific modifications mentioned (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) are precisely the elements that, if changed, could most impact the results\n   - These are not minor technical corrections but fundamental aspects of the research design\n\nWhile there might be extremely rare circumstances where such modifications could have innocent explanations (e.g., correcting an obvious error in the original document while maintaining the intended analysis), the combination of timing and the nature of the changes makes this highly unlikely to occur without some form of misconduct.\n\nProbability: 10"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be extremely likely for these reasons:\n\n1. Strategic manipulation to match results:\n   - This is a textbook example of HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)\n   - Modifying preregistration after seeing data allows researchers to present post-hoc decisions as if they were planned\n   - Changing exclusion criteria after collection enables researchers to selectively include/exclude participants to achieve desired outcomes\n   - Altering primary outcomes allows focusing on whatever showed significant results rather than what was originally hypothesized\n\n2. Creating false documentation:\n   - The modified preregistration creates a false paper trail suggesting that the conducted analyses were planned\n   - This retroactive modification attempts to hide the exploratory nature of the analysis\n   - It creates an illusion of hypothesis confirmation rather than acknowledging data-driven decisions\n\n3. Alignment with other evidence:\n   - This practice connects directly to the suspicious p-value distributions previously mentioned\n   - It would explain how multiple analyses could show p-values just below significance threshold\n   - The modification provides cover for the selective reporting and analysis choices\n\n4. Deliberate nature of the act:\n   - Modifying a preregistration document after data collection requires intentional action\n   - The timestamp evidence shows awareness of when modifications were made\n   - This represents a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the research process\n\n5. Specific targeting of key elements:\n   - The fact that specifically exclusion criteria and primary outcomes were modified is telling\n   - These are precisely the elements that would need to be changed to transform non-significant results into significant ones\n   - This targeted modification suggests strategic manipulation rather than innocent updates\n\nThis type of preregistration modification represents a deliberate form of scientific misconduct designed to create the appearance that data-driven decisions were actually pre-planned. It's a particularly concerning form of misconduct because it undermines one of the key tools (preregistration) designed to prevent p-hacking and selective reporting.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "To determine the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to carefully evaluate all the evidence presented and consider how likely each piece of evidence would be under both scenarios - misconduct versus no misconduct.\n\nThe strongest evidence suggesting misconduct includes:\n\n1. The modified preregistration document after data collection (10% likely if innocent, 95% likely if misconduct)\n2. The unusual distribution of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above (15% likely if innocent, 95% likely if misconduct)\n3. Emails expressing pressure and that she \"needs this one to work\" (85% likely if innocent, 95% likely if misconduct)\n\nEvidence that is more neutral or slightly concerning:\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria (95% likely if innocent, 80% likely if misconduct)\n2. Earlier script versions showing participant exclusions (90% likely if innocent, 95% likely if misconduct)\n3. Software changes and hard drive failure (75% likely if innocent, 70% likely if misconduct)\n\nEvidence suggesting innocence:\n1. Previously well-documented and reproducible work that passed audit (95% likely if innocent, 65% likely if misconduct)\n2. Proper documentation of excluded participants who fell asleep/misunderstood instructions (90% likely if innocent, 70% likely if misconduct)\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution. These are both statistical red flags widely recognized in the field as strong indicators of p-hacking and data manipulation. The timing of preregistration modifications directly contradicts proper scientific procedure, and the p-value clustering is mathematically improbable without manipulation.\n\nWhile some evidence like the software change and hard drive failure could happen regardless of misconduct, and the emails could reflect normal academic pressure, the statistical patterns in the data combined with the preregistration modification create a compelling case for misconduct.\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, with special weight given to the modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution, I assess the probability of misconduct to be high.\n\nProbability: 85"
