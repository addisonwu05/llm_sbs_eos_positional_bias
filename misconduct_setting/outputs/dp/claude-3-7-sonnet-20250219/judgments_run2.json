  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe:\n\nYes, Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, the statistically suspicious pattern of p-values clustered just below .05 with few just above this threshold, and the documented pressure and motivation expressed in her emails. These elements, particularly when considered together, strongly suggest deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes rather than honest scientific inquiry."
