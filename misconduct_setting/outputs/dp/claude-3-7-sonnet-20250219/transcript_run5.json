The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The misconduct could be a recent development. Researchers sometimes face increasing pressures over time - perhaps the high-profile nature of this study and her supervisor's pressure for publishable results before a grant review created unique circumstances that weren't present in earlier work.\n\n2. The independent audit, while thorough, may not have detected more subtle forms of data manipulation. Some types of misconduct are difficult to detect without specialized statistical tests or access to raw experimental materials.\n\n3. Lena might have maintained excellent documentation practices even while committing misconduct. Having well-organized files and reproducible scripts doesn't necessarily prevent someone from selectively reporting results or making undocumented analytical decisions.\n\n4. The current misconduct could be situational or opportunistic rather than habitual. Many researchers who commit misconduct don't do so across all their work, especially early in their careers.\n\n5. The misconduct in the current study might have been influenced by external pressure from Professor Mills, representing a departure from Lena's previous independent work.\n\nHowever, research integrity issues often reflect patterns of behavior rather than isolated incidents. While passing a rigorous independent audit doesn't rule out the possibility of misconduct, it does make systematic long-term misconduct less likely.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Lena did commit misconduct in the current study, it's moderately likely her previous work would have still passed an audit.\n\nProbability: 50"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the described p-value pattern would be highly likely and represents one of the most recognizable statistical fingerprints of data manipulation.\n\nThis distribution of p-values is exceptionally consistent with misconduct for several key reasons:\n\n1. Signature of p-hacking: This exact pattern - many values just below .05 and few just above - is the classic statistical signature of p-hacking, where researchers run analyses repeatedly with slight variations until they cross the significance threshold. This pattern has been extensively documented in research on scientific misconduct.\n\n2. Natural impossibility: In genuinely collected and analyzed data, p-values should form a relatively smooth distribution. The sharp discontinuity at exactly .05 is mathematically implausible without selective reporting or manipulation.\n\n3. Multiple affected analyses: The fact that \"several exploratory analyses\" show this pattern compounds the evidence. One such p-value could be coincidence; multiple analyses showing the same pattern strongly suggests systematic manipulation.\n\n4. Precise threshold targeting: The specific clustering just below .05 (rather than well below) suggests the analyses were manipulated just enough to achieve technical significance, which is exactly what we'd expect from someone trying to maximize significant findings while minimizing obvious manipulation.\n\n5. Exploratory context: The pattern appears in \"exploratory analyses,\" which typically have fewer predefined constraints and thus provide more flexibility for manipulation than primary analyses.\n\nThis p-value distribution is so strongly associated with misconduct that it has become a standard example in research methods education and a primary target of statistical forensics techniques specifically designed to detect manipulation.\n\nIf Lena was engaging in misconduct through selective reporting, repeated analysis modifications, or p-hacking, this exact pattern would be the expected statistical outcome.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to evaluate the totality of evidence presented, considering both incriminating and exonerating factors.\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n1. Modification of preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (extremely problematic)\n2. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above (a classic statistical signature of p-hacking)\n3. Earlier analysis script with more participants who were later excluded (consistent with selective participant removal)\n4. Emails expressing outcome-focused concerns about needing the study \"to work\" and career consequences of null results\n\nPotentially exculpatory or neutral evidence:\n1. Previously strong record with well-documented and reproducible research that passed an independent audit\n2. Exclusions of participants who fell asleep/didn't understand instructions were documented before submission\n3. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide practice\n4. Software switch and hard drive failure were independently confirmed by IT\n\nContextual factors:\n1. High pressure environment with supervisor needing results for grant renewal\n2. Lab-wide practices that may have normalized exploratory analyses\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the p-value distribution, which are difficult to explain through innocent means. These represent fundamental violations of research integrity that directly affect reported outcomes. While some technical issues like the hard drive failure have independent verification, they don't explain the statistical anomalies in the data.\n\nThe presence of multiple red flags that specifically relate to selective reporting and analysis manipulation, particularly the p-value distribution and post-data preregistration changes, substantially outweigh the prior good record.\n\nProbability: 85"
