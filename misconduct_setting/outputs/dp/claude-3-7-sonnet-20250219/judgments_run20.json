  "Based on my analysis of the evidence, including the modified preregistration after data collection, the unusual clustering of p-values just below .05, participant exclusion patterns, and other factors:\n\nYes, I think Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe strongest evidence is the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the statistically improbable distribution of p-values, which are classic indicators of p-hacking and data manipulation. These technical indicators, combined with documented career pressure and multiple versions of analyses, form a compelling case that the results were manipulated to achieve significance rather than reported objectively."
