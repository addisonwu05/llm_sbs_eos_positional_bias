The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This distribution is a textbook statistical signature of p-hacking - the practice of analyzing data multiple ways or selectively excluding observations until results cross the significance threshold. Researchers engaged in misconduct often stop analyzing once they achieve p < .05.\n\n2. The specific clustering of values (.047, .049, .041) just below the threshold is exactly what statistical research on publication bias and data manipulation predicts. Researchers like Uri Simonsohn, Joseph Simmons, and others have identified this pattern as a strong indicator of questionable research practices.\n\n3. The fact that this appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" is particularly telling - exploratory analyses without pre-registered hypotheses provide the most flexibility for manipulation.\n\n4. The absence of p-values just above .05 creates an unnatural \"cliff\" in the distribution that is statistically improbable without selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\n5. This pattern matches what we would expect if a researcher was deliberately trying to present results as significant while staying just below the conventional threshold.\n\nThis specific statistical pattern has been so strongly associated with questionable practices that it has led to widespread changes in how journals evaluate statistical evidence. It represents one of the most well-documented statistical signatures of potential misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did commit academic misconduct, the probability of seeing this distinctive p-value pattern would be extremely high.\n\n95"

The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - a serious violation of research integrity principles\n2. The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and almost none just above - a statistical pattern strongly associated with p-hacking\n3. Emails expressing pressure about needing positive results for her career and the grant\n4. Multiple analysis scripts with different participant exclusions suggest potential selective analysis\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n1. Previously strong record of data handling with studies that passed independent audit\n2. Some missing files explained by a verified hard drive failure\n3. Lab-wide practice of exploring multiple analyses for robustness\n4. Proper documentation of participant exclusions with notes predating journal submission\n\nContextual factors:\n1. Software transition midway through the project could explain some inconsistencies\n2. High pressure from supervisor regarding grant renewal\n3. Career concerns that might motivate but don't prove misconduct\n\nThe strongest evidence for misconduct is the modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution. These are objective indicators that would be extremely unlikely to occur without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting. The modified preregistration directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration, while the p-value distribution shows a statistical pattern that extensive research has linked to p-hacking.\n\nWhile Lena's prior clean record and some legitimate explanations for certain irregularities provide some counterevidence, they don't adequately explain the most damning evidence. The pressure revealed in her emails provides clear motivation.\n\nWeighing all factors, the evidence strongly suggests academic misconduct occurred.\n\n85"
