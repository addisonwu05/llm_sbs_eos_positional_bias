  "Yes, I think Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests misconduct, particularly:\n\n1. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. The statistically suspicious pattern of p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above\n3. The evidence of participant exclusions between earlier and final analyses\n4. Her documented motivation and pressure to produce positive results\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate technical issues, the pattern of evidence—especially the modified preregistration and unusual p-value distribution—presents a compelling case that crosses the threshold from questionable research practices to academic misconduct."
