The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Labs may change software packages for various legitimate reasons:\n- The lab might have received new funding allowing for better software\n- They might have discovered limitations in the original software\n- A collaborator might have required compatibility with different tools\n- The department might have changed institutional licenses or support\n\nAs for hard drive failures, these are unfortunate but regular occurrences in academic settings. Researchers often use personal laptops heavily for years, increasing failure risk. The fact that the IT department confirmed both the report and repair of the hardware failure provides external verification that this event genuinely occurred.\n\nThe co-occurrence of these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) during a project wouldn't be particularly unusual. Research projects, especially in PhD programs, often span years, increasing the likelihood of experiencing technical issues during their course.\n\nWhat's important here is that there's documented evidence of the hard drive failure from IT, which provides an independent verification of at least one of these technical issues. This makes the explanation more credible than if it were solely Lena's claim.\n\nThe timing might seem convenient, but technical problems often create cascading issues in research projects. For example, incompatibilities between old and new software versions might have contributed to file corruption or data management challenges.\n\nGiven all this information, these technical issues would be quite plausible in the absence of academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"

However, several factors are important to consider:\n\n1. The software switch was a lab-wide decision, not Lena's personal choice. For this to be part of a cover-up, either Professor Mills would need to be complicit, or Lena would have had to opportunistically use an independently occurring software transition.\n\n2. The hard drive failure was confirmed by the IT department. This means an actual hardware failure did occur and was documented by third parties. This couldn't easily be faked.\n\n3.

However, intentional damage to a hard drive to destroy evidence is not impossible, though quite risky and sophisticated for a typical PhD student.\n\nThe software switch would likely happen regardless of misconduct, as this would typically be a lab or department decision outside Lena's direct control.\n\nIf misconduct occurred, these events could provide convenient cover, but they would not necessarily be caused by the misconduct itself.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

This specific pressure might not have existed during Lena's earlier work, removing a key motivation for misconduct.

The current study is described as \"high-profile\" testing a \"new theory,\" suggesting greater pressure than her earlier projects might have had.\n\n4. **Learning methods of misconduct**: Researchers who engage in misconduct typically develop these practices over time.

The psychology literature specifically identifies this \"bump\" just below .05 as evidence of manipulation.\n\n2. **Selective reporting indicator**: If Lena ran multiple analyses and only reported those yielding p < .05, this would naturally create the described pattern. Tests yielding p-values just above .05 would be systematically excluded or modified.\n\n3. **Exploratory analyses vulnerability**: The fact that these suspicious p-values appear in \"exploratory analyses\" is particularly telling.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be highly problematic and difficult to explain through legitimate research practices.\n\nLet me analyze why this is concerning:\n\n1. **Fundamental violation of preregistration principles**: The entire purpose of preregistration is to document analysis plans before seeing the data to prevent hypothesizing after results are known. Changing preregistered plans after data collection directly undermines this core scientific safeguard.\n\n2. **Changes to exclusion criteria**: Modifying exclusion criteria after seeing the data creates researcher degrees of freedom that can be used to select participants in a way that produces desired outcomes. This is particularly concerning given the previously noted pattern of p-values just below .05.\n\n3. **Changes to primary outcomes**: Altering the primary outcomes after data collection is one of the most serious forms of questionable research practice. It allows researchers to selectively focus on measures that showed significant results while downplaying those that didn't.\n\n4. **Timestamp evidence**: The file timestamps provide objective evidence that the modifications occurred after data collection, making this impossible to dismiss as a documentation error or misunderstanding.\n\n5. **Transparency violation**: Failing to transparently acknowledge these post-data-collection changes (which would be required in ethical research) suggests an intent to present post-hoc decisions as a priori plans.\n\nWhile there are rare legitimate reasons to update a preregistration (e.g., to correct errors or address unforeseen technical issues), such changes should be transparently documented with clear justifications. The description provided suggests undisclosed modifications to core methodological elements, which is extremely difficult to reconcile with research integrity.\n\nThis type of modification after data collection represents a fundamental breach of scientific research principles.\n\nProbability judgment: 10"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection would be highly consistent with deliberate data manipulation. Let me explain why:\n\n1. **Strategic outcome switching**: Changing primary outcomes after seeing the data is a textbook form of scientific misconduct that allows researchers to selectively highlight measures that showed significant results while hiding those that failed. This directly enables the creation of a misleading narrative.\n\n2. **Retroactive exclusion justification**: Modifying exclusion criteria after data collection provides a seemingly legitimate basis for removing participants whose data don't support the hypothesis. This creates a false impression that participant exclusions were planned rather than result-driven.\n\n3. **False appearance of confirmation**: By aligning the preregistration with already-known results, a researcher can create the illusion that confirmatory analyses supported their hypothesis, dramatically increasing the perceived strength and credibility of the findings.\n\n4. **Covering tracks**: The modification of the preregistration document represents a sophisticated attempt to eliminate evidence of p-hacking by retroactively making it appear that the successful analytical approach was planned all along.\n\n5. **Timestamp evidence**: The file timestamps showing modification after data collection provide concrete evidence of the temporal sequence that would be necessary for this type of manipulation.\n\n6. **Comprehensive manipulation strategy**: This action fits perfectly with the other evidence (p-value clustering, participant exclusions, expressed pressure for results) as part of a coherent strategy to produce and justify significant findings.\n\nThis type of preregistration modification is particularly concerning because it undermines one of science's core safeguards against bias. It represents a deliberate effort to present exploratory analyses and post-hoc decisions as if they were confirmatory tests of pre-specified hypotheses - a fundamental misrepresentation of the scientific process.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "I'll evaluate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct by examining all the evidence presented and weighing both incriminating and exonerating factors.\n\nKey evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: The file timestamps showing changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is extremely problematic and difficult to explain innocently.\n\n2. **Unusual p-value distribution**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above in exploratory analyses is a recognized statistical signature of p-hacking.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions from earlier analyses**: The progression from more participants in earlier scripts to fewer in the final analysis, without comprehensive documentation, suggests potential selective exclusion.\n\n4. **Expressed pressure in emails**: Lena's statements about needing the study to \"work\" for her career and her supervisor's grant establish clear motivation.\n\n5. **Whistleblower concerns**: The initial allegation that data \"look too perfect\" came from someone with enough expertise to identify suspicious patterns.\n\nMitigating factors:\n\n1. **Previously clean record**: Lena's prior work passed an independent data audit and was rated well-documented and reproducible.\n\n2. **Some documented exclusions**: At least two participants had legitimate exclusion notes predating journal submission.\n\n3. **Lab-wide practices**: Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria matched patterns from other students in the lab.\n\n4. **Confirmed technical issues**: The IT department verified the hard drive failure, and the lab did switch statistical software.\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damaging evidence involves the modified preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution, and the pattern of participant exclusions. While the technical issues and previous good record provide some alternative explanations, they don't adequately account for the statistical anomalies and preregistration changes, which are difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nThe totality of evidence suggests a high probability of some form of academic misconduct, likely involving p-hacking, selective reporting, and retroactive modification of analysis plans.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
