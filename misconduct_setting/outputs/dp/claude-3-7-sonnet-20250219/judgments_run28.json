  "Yes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe evidence strongly points to deliberate manipulation of the research process, particularly the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below the significance threshold. These represent serious violations of research integrity that cannot be easily explained by honest mistakes or technical issues. While Lena has a good prior record, the combination of clear motivation (as revealed in her emails), opportunity, and objective evidence like file timestamps and statistical anomalies creates a compelling case that misconduct occurred in this specific study."
