The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) - By altering the preregistration, a researcher can make post-hoc discoveries appear to have been predicted in advance, artificially strengthening the apparent validity of the findings.\n\n3. Strategic exclusion criteria - Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a powerful way to manipulate results, as it allows selective removal of participants whose data don't support the desired conclusions.\n\n4. Concealment of flexibility - This approach attempts to hide analytical flexibility by making it seem that the final analysis approach was the one planned from the beginning.\n\n5. Timestamp evidence - The file timestamps provide objective technical evidence of the tampering, making this a particularly clear indicator of misconduct.\n\nThis behavior represents one of the most direct forms of scientific fraud because it specifically undermines the key mechanism (preregistration) that the scientific community has developed to prevent selective reporting and publication bias. It demonstrates both awareness of proper research practices and deliberate circumvention of them.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, this modification of the preregistration would be a central and revealing component of that misconduct.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "I need to evaluate all the evidence collectively to determine the probability of academic misconduct by Lena:\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is one of the most serious violations of research integrity.\n\n2. The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 in exploratory analyses - a classic statistical signature of p-hacking.\n\n3. Earlier analysis scripts showing participants who were later excluded, potentially indicating selective removal to achieve significance.\n\n4. Emails expressing pressure and the need for the study to \"work,\" revealing motivation for potential misconduct.\n\n**Evidence suggesting innocence or providing context:**\n\n1. Previously clean record with work rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" in an independent audit.\n\n2. The lab's culture of running multiple analyses to test robustness, which could explain some analytical variations.\n\n3. Legitimate hardware issues (confirmed hard drive failure) and software changes.\n\n4. Properly documented exclusion of participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions.\n\n**Most damning evidence:**\nThe modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution are particularly concerning as they are difficult to explain through legitimate research practices. These represent core violations of research methodology rather than minor discrepancies.\n\nWhile Lena may have had a clean record previously, the combination of clear motivation (as expressed in emails), suspicious statistical patterns, and direct evidence of tampering with the preregistration presents a compelling case that misconduct occurred in this specific study.\n\nThe balance of evidence strongly suggests intentional manipulation of analyses and reporting to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nProbability: 85"
