  "Based on the comprehensive evaluation of the evidence presented, my assessment is:\n\nYes, Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe evidence that most strongly supports this conclusion includes:\n\n1. The modified preregistration document after data collection had already begun, changing critical elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. The statistically improbable distribution of p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above .05\n3. The pattern of participant exclusions between earlier and later analysis scripts\n4. The documented pressure and motivation expressed in emails about needing the study to work\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean research record and some legitimate technical challenges, the objective evidence of tampering with the preregistration and the telltale statistical patterns in the final results strongly indicate deliberate manipulation rather than honest mistakes or coincidental findings."
