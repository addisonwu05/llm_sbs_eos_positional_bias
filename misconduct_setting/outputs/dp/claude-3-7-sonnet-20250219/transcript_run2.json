The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This could be her first instance of misconduct. Many researchers who engage in misconduct don't start their careers doing so. They often begin with honest practices and only later turn to questionable methods due to pressure, opportunity, or other factors. As a third-year PhD student facing a high-profile experiment with a supervisor under pressure for publishable results, this might represent a breaking point rather than a pattern.\n\n2. The current study may involve unique pressures. The case notes that Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This specific pressure might not have existed for earlier projects.\n\n3. Skills in documentation and reproducibility are separate from ethical decision-making. A researcher can be technically proficient at organizing and documenting data while still choosing to commit misconduct under certain circumstances.\n\n4. Previous audits may have focused on documentation quality rather than detecting subtle forms of data manipulation. Well-organized, reproducible analyses can still contain fabricated or manipulated data if done skillfully.\n\n5. Research misconduct often escalates gradually. Lena may have started with minor questionable research practices that weren't detected in previous audits and only later engaged in more serious misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, even if Lena did commit misconduct in the current study, it's still reasonably likely that her previous work was honest and therefore passed the independent audit.

Misunderstanding of preregistration principles:\n   - Lena might not understand that preregistrations should not be modified after data collection\n   - As a third-year PhD student, she might have insufficient training on preregistration practices\n   - However, changing primary outcomes specifically shows awareness of their importance\n\n2.

Covering tracks:\n   - Someone committing misconduct would want documentation to appear consistent\n   - Modifying the preregistration helps align all documentation with the manipulated analysis\n\nThis behavior directly undermines the entire purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researchers from changing their analytical plans after seeing results. The specific modifications to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are particularly problematic, as these are exactly the elements that would be changed to engineer desired outcomes.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, modifying the preregistration document in this way would be an almost inevitable part of covering up p-hacking or outcome switching.\n\n95"

Statistical expectation:\n   - If analyses are conducted properly on genuine data, p-values should be somewhat evenly distributed\n   - There's no natural statistical mechanism that would cause clustering just below .05 without similar clustering just above\n   - When null hypotheses are false, p-values tend to be distributed toward the lower end (well below .05), not clustered near the threshold\n\n2. Focus on exploratory analyses:\n   - Exploratory analyses have fewer constraints than primary analyses\n   - Without misconduct, these should still produce a relatively smooth distribution of p-values\n   - Having multiple exploratory analyses with this pattern compounds the unlikelihood\n\n3. Multiple affected analyses:\n   - The pattern appearing across \"several\" exploratory analyses makes a chance occurrence extremely unlikely\n   - Natural variation might produce this pattern occasionally, but not consistently across multiple analyses\n\n4. Specific clustering:\n   - The clustering specifically at values like .047, .049, .041 (just below significance) rather than more broadly\n   - Without misconduct, we would expect to see p-values at .051, .053, etc. with similar frequency\n\n5. Research on p-value distributions:\n   - Statistical research has shown that this specific pattern (many values just below .05, few just above) is a strong indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting\n   - This pattern has been used in meta-scientific research as an indicator of potential questionable research practices\n\nThis distribution pattern is among the most recognized statistical fingerprints of p-hacking or selective reporting in the scientific literature. While theoretically possible through random chance, the specific clustering pattern described across multiple analyses is extraordinarily unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this specific pattern is extremely low.\n\n10"

Direct result of p-hacking:\n   - P-hacking (analyzing data multiple ways until finding significant results) specifically produces this pattern\n   - When researchers try different analyses until finding significance, they stop once p-values cross below .05\n   - This creates an artificial buildup of values just below the threshold with a drop-off above it\n\n2. Strategic analytical decisions:\n   - If committing misconduct, a researcher might try multiple exclusion criteria, covariates, or statistical tests\n   - Each variation that produces p > .05 would be discarded while those producing p < .05 would be kept\n   - This selective reporting directly generates the observed distribution\n\n3. Exploratory analyses vulnerability:\n   - Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to manipulation since they have fewer constraints\n   - Someone committing misconduct would have maximum flexibility in these analyses\n   - The pattern appearing in \"several exploratory analyses\" is consistent with systematic p-hacking\n\n4. Documented statistical fingerprint:\n   - This specific pattern has been extensively documented in research on scientific misconduct\n   - Meta-scientific studies have shown this distribution is a reliable indicator of questionable practices\n   - It's one of the most recognized statistical signatures of selective reporting\n\n5. Difficulty of producing naturally:\n   - This distribution is extremely difficult to generate without some form of selective analysis or reporting\n   - The pattern appearing across multiple analyses makes coincidence virtually impossible\n\nThis p-value distribution represents exactly what we would expect to see if results were being manipulated through selective analysis choices or selective reporting. The pattern is so strongly associated with misconduct that it has become a standard test in meta-research for identifying problematic research practices.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct involving p-hacking or selective reporting, this pattern would be a highly likely consequence of those actions.\n\n95"

Modified preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (very serious violation)\n2. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above (strong statistical fingerprint of p-hacking)\n3. Emails expressing pressure and stating she \"needs this one to work\" (establishes motive)\n4. Whistleblower claim that data \"looks too perfect\" and analyses were changed after reviews\n\nPotentially concerning evidence:\n5. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria (could be legitimate robustness testing or p-hacking)\n6. Earlier script including more participants than the final dataset (could be legitimate data cleaning or selective exclusion)\n7. Software switch and hard drive failure leading to missing files (creates opportunity for undetectable manipulation)\n\nExculpatory evidence:\n8. Previous studies passed independent data audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" rating\n9. Proper documentation of legitimate participant exclusions (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) predating submission\n10. Lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses as robustness tests\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the unusual p-value distribution. Preregistration modification after data collection to change primary outcomes is a fundamental breach of research integrity and directly undermines the purpose of preregistration. The p-value distribution is a recognized statistical signature of p-hacking that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nWhen combined with the documented pressure, the evidence forms a coherent narrative of a researcher who felt intense career pressure, modified her preregistration to match more favorable analyses, and engaged in selective analysis practices that produced the telltale p-value distribution.\n\nWhile her previously good record and some proper documentation practices suggest she understood proper research methods, the weight of evidence strongly suggests misconduct occurred in this specific high-pressure study.\n\n85"
