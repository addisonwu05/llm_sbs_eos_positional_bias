  "Based on the comprehensive evidence provided, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- The modification of the preregistration document after data collection\n- The unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above\n- The pattern of participant exclusions between early and final analyses\n- The combination of clear motivational pressure and opportunity\n\nWhile some elements have potential innocent explanations (software changes, hard drive failure), the specific patterns observed in the statistical results and documentation modifications strongly indicate deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes rather than honest mistakes or standard research practices.\n\nYes"
