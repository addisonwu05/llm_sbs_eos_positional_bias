The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The nature of the independent audit itself matters. Some audits might focus on documentation and organizational aspects rather than conducting deep statistical analyses that could detect sophisticated data manipulation.\n\nIt's notable that academic misconduct often follows a pattern, but not always. Some researchers do begin with honest work and only later engage in misconduct as pressures increase.\n\nGiven that the previous audit specifically rated her work as \"well-documented and reproducible,\" it suggests a thorough review occurred.

Someone committing misconduct would likely be aware of these pressures and might discuss them openly with trusted confidants, possibly even as a way of subconsciously justifying their actions to themselves.\n\n6. The private nature of these communications (emails to a friend) makes them particularly likely to contain honest reflections about motivations. People who commit misconduct rarely discuss their intentions in formal or public settings but might reveal their thinking in private conversations.\n\nThese statements don't just indicate awareness of academic pressures but specifically establish the three key components typically present in cases of confirmed research misconduct: external pressure, personal consequences, and outcome necessity. If Lena did commit misconduct, it would be very likely for her to have expressed exactly these sentiments to a trusted friend.\n\n95"

Data cleaning and refinement is a standard iterative process in research. Initial scripts often include all collected data before applying exclusion criteria.\n\n2. Legitimate reasons for participant exclusion commonly emerge during data analysis phases, such as:\n   - Discovery of outliers or problematic data patterns\n   - Application of pre-established exclusion criteria\n   - Identification of participants who didn't follow task instructions\n   - Recognition of data quality issues not apparent during collection\n\n3. The normal progression of analysis typically starts with broader inclusion and moves toward more refined datasets as researchers better understand their data.\n\n4. The fact that this earlier version was found in an automated backup rather than being deliberately preserved suggests normal file versioning rather than an attempt to hide previous analyses.\n\n5. The progressive refinement of datasets often involves creating multiple script versions as researchers test different approaches and apply various quality control measures.\n\n6. Without additional context about why these participants were excluded or whether the exclusions followed pre-registered criteria, the mere existence of an earlier script with more participants is entirely consistent with standard research practices.\n\nWhat matters most is whether the participant exclusions followed legitimate, preferably pre-registered criteria, and whether these exclusions were transparently reported in the final paper. The existence of earlier scripts with more participants is a normal part of the research workflow if conducted with integrity.\n\n85"

Selective exclusion of participants is one of the most effective and frequently used methods of p-hacking. By removing participants whose data don't support the desired outcome, researchers can artificially strengthen their results.\n\n2. The progression from an earlier script (with more participants) to a final dataset (with strategic exclusions) represents exactly the paper trail we would expect to see when someone is testing which participants to remove to achieve statistical significance.\n\n3. This pattern is particularly suspicious when combined with other red flags in this case - like the modified preregistration and clustering of p-values just below .05.\n\n4. The fact that this earlier script was found in an automated backup rather than being deliberately preserved suggests Lena may not have intended for others to discover this evolution in her analysis.\n\n5. In cases of confirmed research misconduct, forensic analysis often reveals precisely this pattern: earlier, more inclusive analyses that didn't yield desired results, followed by progressively more filtered datasets until significance thresholds are reached.\n\n6. When researchers commit misconduct, they typically don't fabricate data from scratch but rather selectively analyze or exclude existing data - exactly the pattern suggested by finding an earlier script with more participants.\n\n7. Given the pressures Lena expressed in her emails about needing the study to work, selective participant exclusion would be an expedient method to achieve significant results without outright fabrication.\n\nIf Lena was engaged in misconduct, this evidence of evolving participant inclusion criteria would be highly consistent with typical patterns of data manipulation, particularly p-hacking through selective exclusion.\n\n90"

I'll consider each piece of evidence and its implications.\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. Modified preregistration document after data collection: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing data is a fundamental violation of research integrity. This is one of the most serious red flags.\n\n2. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above: This statistical pattern is a classic fingerprint of p-hacking and extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\n3. Earlier analysis script with more participants who were later excluded: This suggests possible selective exclusion to achieve desired results, especially concerning when combined with other evidence.\n\n4. Emails expressing pressure and need for specific outcomes: While not conclusive alone, these provide clear motive and context for misconduct.\n\nEvidence with mixed implications:\n\n1. Lab switching statistical software and hard drive failure: These events could occur regardless of misconduct, though they might provide convenient cover for data irregularities.\n\n2. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: While consistent with a lab-wide robustness initiative, this could also facilitate finding favorable analyses to report.\n\nEvidence suggesting proper research practice:\n\n1. Good track record in previous studies with clean audits: This suggests Lena previously maintained good practices, though doesn't preclude later misconduct.\n\n2. Proper documentation of participant exclusions: The contemporaneous notes about participants falling asleep or not understanding instructions appear to be legitimate exclusions.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution are particularly damning as they directly indicate manipulation of analyses.\n- The combination of expressed pressure, evolving participant exclusions, and precisely the statistical patterns we'd expect from p-hacking creates a consistent narrative of misconduct.\n- The previous clean record suggests Lena knows proper practices but may have deviated under pressure.\n\nConsidering the totality of evidence, particularly the statistical patterns and modified preregistration that are difficult to explain innocently, the probability that Lena committed some form of academic misconduct is quite high.\n\n85"
