The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The fact that other students show similar patterns in their scripts - indicating this is normal behavior within this research environment\n3. Good research practices that involve testing the sensitivity of results to different analytical choices (sometimes called \"multiverse analysis\" or \"robustness checks\")\n\nIn research, especially in fields like cognitive neuroscience where data processing involves many researcher degrees of freedom, it's considered thorough and responsible to test how different exclusion criteria affect results.

Specifically:\n\n1. **Consistency in research practices**: A researcher who maintains good data management practices is likely to continue those practices across projects. The fact that her previous work passed an independent audit suggests she had internalized proper research methods.\n\n2. **Skill development**: PhD students typically develop and refine their research skills over time. Having already demonstrated competence in data documentation and reproducibility, Lena would likely maintain or improve these skills in subsequent research.\n\n3. **Research integrity as a character trait**: Research ethics tends to be relatively stable as a personal characteristic. Those who value transparency and reproducibility generally maintain those values across projects.\n\n4. **Established workflow**: Researchers typically develop workflows and systems for managing their data. Once established, these systems tend to be applied consistently across projects.\n\n## Contextual considerations\n\n- The independent audit provides objective external validation of Lena's research practices\n- The specific description of her work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates a substantive review, not just a cursory check\n- As a third-year PhD student, Lena would have had time to establish consistent research practices\n\n## Probability assessment\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct in the current case, it would be highly likely that her previous work would demonstrate good research practices.

Research misconduct often occurs as a response to specific circumstances rather than as a consistent pattern throughout a career.\n\n2. **Escalation of questionable practices**: Researchers sometimes gradually escalate from minor questionable research practices to more serious misconduct. Her earlier work might have been genuinely proper, with ethical boundaries being crossed only later.\n\n3. **Different stakes**: The current study is described as \"high-profile\" with a supervisor \"under pressure to produce publishable findings.\" These pressures might not have existed for previous projects, removing the incentive for misconduct.\n\n4. **Learning effective deception**: It's possible that genuinely conducting earlier studies properly gave Lena the knowledge and skills to later effectively disguise misconduct. Understanding proper documentation makes it easier to fabricate convincing-looking data.\n\n5. **Different scrutiny levels**: The independent audit of previous work might not have been looking for the specific types of manipulation used in the current study.\n\n## Research patterns on misconduct\n\nScientific misconduct literature suggests that many researchers who engage in serious misconduct have previously conducted legitimate research. First-time misconduct is often triggered by specific pressures or opportunities rather than being part of a consistent pattern of behavior.\n\nAdditionally, someone who knows how to properly document research would be better positioned to create convincing fabricated data that could pass initial scrutiny.\n\n## Probability assessment\n\nGiven the contextual factors (high-profile experiment, pressure from supervisor), and the fact that misconduct often occurs situationally rather than as a persistent pattern, it remains quite plausible that Lena could have conducted earlier studies properly while committing misconduct in this instance.\n\nThe prior clean record does not strongly contradict the possibility of current misconduct, especially given the heightened pressure described in the current situation.\n\n65"

This pattern of narrowing participant inclusion through progressive analysis iterations is standard methodological practice.\n\nWhile the context doesn't specify why participants were excluded between versions, the existence of different versions with different participant counts is entirely consistent with legitimate research practices and the typical evolution of analysis through multiple iterations.\n\n85"

The progressive elimination of participants between early and final analyses is a classic method of data manipulation to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nThis pattern is particularly concerning in light of other contextual factors such as the modified preregistration and the expressed pressure to produce positive results.\n\n95"

Even when true effects exist:\n   - There should be no clustering specifically just below the .05 threshold\n   - The distribution of p-values around .05 should be relatively smooth\n   - Values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .053) should be approximately as common as those just below\n\n2. **Exploratory analyses considerations**: For exploratory analyses specifically:\n   - Multiple testing typically produces some significant and some non-significant results\n   - The boundary of .05 has no special meaning for the underlying data\n   - Natural variation should produce a mix of values above and below .05\n\n3. **Known statistical phenomena**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 with an absence of values just above is:\n   - Recognized in the scientific literature as a strong indicator of p-hacking\n   - Extremely unlikely to occur naturally in properly conducted research\n   - Documented in meta-scientific research as a red flag for data manipulation\n\n4. **Methodological explanations**: There are very few innocent explanations for this pattern:\n   - No valid statistical procedure preferentially produces p-values just below .05\n   - No legitimate exclusion criteria would selectively affect p-values in this region\n   - No natural phenomenon explains the absence of values just above .05\n\n## Statistical probability assessment\n\nThe probability of observing \"an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05\" with \"almost no p-values just above .05\" through chance or legitimate analysis is extremely low.

The modified preregistration document after data collection (a fundamental breach of research practice)\n2. The statistically improbable clustering of p-values just below .05 (a recognized signature of p-hacking)\n3. The participant exclusion pattern between script versions\n\nThese represent objective, documentable issues that are difficult to explain through innocent means. The p-value distribution in particular is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of data manipulation in scientific research.\n\nWhile Lena's previously clean record and some legitimate technical issues provide some counterbalance, they don't adequately explain the statistical anomalies and preregistration modifications.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, particularly the modified preregistration and the statistically suspicious p-value distribution, there is a high probability that academic misconduct occurred.\n\n85"
