The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to evaluate the likelihood of Lena legitimately excluding two participants based on documented issues, assuming she did not commit misconduct.\n\nIn scientific research, particularly in cognitive neuroscience experiments:\n\n1. It's standard practice to exclude participants who fall asleep during experiments or don't understand instructions. These are valid exclusion criteria because:\n   - A sleeping participant cannot engage with the task properly\n   - A participant who misunderstands instructions will produce data that doesn't reflect the intended experimental conditions\n\n2. Proper protocol involves documenting exclusions contemporaneously in raw data files, exactly as Lena appears to have done. These exclusion notes predating any journal submission is consistent with good research practices.\n\n3. In a study with 80 participants, having 2 participants (2.5% of the sample) experience these issues is quite reasonable and expected. Cognitive tasks can be tedious, and some participants may struggle with instructions.\n\n4. The fact that these exclusions were documented in real-time rather than post-analysis makes them more credible as legitimate exclusions rather than data manipulation.\n\nIf Lena were fabricating data or manipulating results improperly, it would be unusual to create such specific and limited exclusion justifications. Fabricators typically wouldn't bother creating detailed contemporaneous documentation for legitimate-looking exclusions - they might simply remove inconvenient data points or create entirely new data.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentation of standard exclusion criteria for a reasonable number of participants is highly consistent with proper scientific conduct.\n\nProbability: 90"

The exclusion criteria themselves (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) are scientifically valid and commonly accepted reasons to remove participants from cognitive studies.\n\n2. The proportion excluded (2 out of 80, or 2.5%) is modest and well within normal ranges for these types of studies.\n\n3.

A sophisticated fraudster might specifically create proper documentation for exclusions to avoid suspicion.

This could be Lena's first instance of misconduct:\n   - Researchers who engage in misconduct don't necessarily start their careers that way\n   - The pressure described (high-profile experiment, supervisor under pressure before grant review) might represent new circumstances that led to a first-time ethical lapse\n   - Early-career researchers often maintain higher standards before facing increasing publication pressures as they advance\n\n2.

This pattern is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking:\n   - Researchers who manipulate analyses to achieve significance typically stop once they cross the magical .05 threshold\n   - This creates an artificial clustering just below the significance threshold\n   - The absence of values just above .05 suggests selective reporting or manipulation until significance is achieved\n\n2. In exploratory analyses specifically, this pattern is especially revealing:\n   - Exploratory analyses provide multiple opportunities to adjust parameters and exclusion criteria\n   - Without pre-registration constraints, researchers have flexibility to try multiple approaches\n   - If misconduct occurred, exploratory analyses would be the easiest place to engage in selective reporting\n\n3. Common misconduct techniques that produce exactly this pattern:\n   - Selectively reporting only the analyses that reached significance\n   - Running analyses repeatedly with slight modifications until crossing the threshold\n   - Excluding specific participants or data points to push borderline results into significance\n   - Stopping data collection after achieving significance\n\n4. Statistical understanding of this pattern:\n   - This \"bunching\" just below .05 has been extensively documented in research on publication bias and p-hacking\n   - Statistical simulations show this pattern is highly unlikely to occur naturally\n   - Meta-scientific research has identified this as one of the most reliable indicators of selective reporting\n\n5.

The timestamp evidence creates a clear timeline:\n   - The objective evidence shows modifications after data collection\n   - This timing precisely aligns with when one would make changes after seeing disappointing initial results\n   - The digital trail provides concrete documentation of the misconduct\n\n4. Preregistration was specifically designed to prevent this behavior:\n   - The entire purpose of preregistration is to prevent post-hoc adjustments to analysis plans\n   - Modifying the document undermines scientific integrity at its core\n   - This represents a deliberate circumvention of research safeguards\n\n5. This action shows awareness of scientific norms while violating them:\n   - The fact that a preregistration exists shows Lena understood its importance\n   - Rather than noting deviations transparently, modifying the document suggests intent to conceal changes\n   - This demonstrates knowledge of proper procedures combined with deliberate subversion\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, this modification of the preregistration would be a central and damning element - a deliberate attempt to make post-hoc decisions appear as though they were planned in advance, which strikes at the heart of scientific integrity.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these email statements would be if Lena did not commit any academic misconduct.\n\nThese types of statements reflect the real pressures that exist in academic research, particularly for PhD students:\n\n1. The comment about her supervisor \"counting on this study to save the grant\" reflects:\n   - The genuine funding pressures in academic research\n   - The responsibility students feel toward their advisors' research programs\n   - Awareness of the stakes involved in the project\n   - This is a common dynamic in research labs where grant renewals depend on productive research\n\n2. The statement that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" indicates:\n   - Recognition of publication bias in academia (significant results are more publishable)\n   - Understanding of the competitive academic job market\n   - Awareness that publications are currency for academic advancement\n   - This is a realistic assessment many graduate students would make\n\n3. Saying \"I need this one to work\" could reflect:\n   - Hope for a successful experiment rather than intent to manipulate\n   - Natural anxiety about career prospects\n   - Investment in the research question and its outcome\n   - Emotional response to pressure, not necessarily intent to falsify\n\n4. Context of private communication:\n   - These are private emails to a friend, where people often express anxieties\n   - Venting about academic pressures is extremely common among PhD students\n   - The informal language suggests candid expression of stress rather than admission of misconduct\n\nMany honest researchers feel these pressures and express similar sentiments while still maintaining research integrity. These statements reflect the problematic incentive structures in academia that affect even ethical researchers, not necessarily an intent to commit fraud.\n\nProbability: 75"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, these email statements provide significant insight into her potential motivation and mindset. Let me analyze how likely such communications would be:\n\n1. These statements establish clear motive for misconduct:\n   - The pressure from her supervisor regarding the grant creates external motivation\n   - The concern about postdoc prospects demonstrates personal career stakes\n   - \"I need this one to work\" suggests a results-oriented rather than process-oriented approach\n   - Together, they form a classic pressure triangle of mentor expectations, career advancement, and personal investment\n\n2. The psychological state expressed aligns with research on misconduct:\n   - Studies of academic fraud often identify perception of \"no alternative\" as a risk factor\n   - The language suggests rationalization (\"I need this\") that often precedes ethical violations\n   - The framing of results as something that can be made to \"work\" reflects a problematic view of research\n\n3. Private communications often reveal underlying intentions:\n   - These emails to a friend represent unguarded thoughts rather than public positioning\n   - The frankness suggests Lena felt comfortable expressing her results-focused mindset\n   - People who commit misconduct often disclose pressure and motivations in private communications\n\n4. The specific language choices are telling:\n   - \"Counting on\" suggests perceived responsibility beyond scientific discovery\n   - \"Kill my chances\" frames negative results as personally catastrophic\n   - \"Need this one to work\" implies an outcome-determined view incompatible with objective science\n\n5. Timing and context matter:\n   - These statements would create a timeline of pressure preceding the problematic data patterns\n   - They would connect the motivational dots for why manipulation might have occurred\n   - They provide context for the other red flags like modified preregistration and p-value clustering\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, emails expressing these sentiments would be highly consistent with the psychological state that often accompanies research fraud - feeling trapped by career pressure, advisor expectations, and personal need for \"successful\" results.\n\nProbability: 90"

    "content": "To evaluate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to systematically assess all the evidence presented, considering both incriminating and exculpatory factors.\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. Modified preregistration after data collection: The timestamps showing changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data was collected is a serious violation of research integrity.\n\n2. P-value clustering: The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 (with almost none just above) in exploratory analyses is a statistical red flag highly associated with p-hacking.\n\n3. Participant exclusions: Earlier scripts showing more participants who were later excluded, when combined with the modified preregistration, suggests possible selective data removal.\n\n4. Emails expressing pressure: Statements that she \"needs this one to work\" and concerns about career implications establish clear motive.\n\nPotentially exculpatory or neutral evidence:\n\n1. Previously strong record: Lena passed an earlier independent data audit with work rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. Multiple analysis scripts: While concerning, these were part of a lab-wide practice with other students showing similar patterns.\n\n3. Technical issues: The software switch and confirmed hard drive failure provide some explanation for irregularities, though they could also provide convenient cover.\n\n4. Proper exclusion documentation: The exclusion of two participants who fell asleep or misunderstood instructions was properly documented in real-time.\n\nWhen weighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the statistical anomalies in p-value distribution. These represent objective indicators of questionable research practices that are difficult to explain innocently. The combination of multiple concerning elements - modified preregistration, unusual p-value patterns, participant exclusions between versions, and expressed result-oriented pressure - creates a pattern consistent with deliberate misconduct.\n\nProbability: 85"
