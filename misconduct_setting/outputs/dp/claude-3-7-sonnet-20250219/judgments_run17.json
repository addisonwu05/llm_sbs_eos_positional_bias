  "Yes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence is the combination of:\n1) The modification of the preregistration document after data collection\n2) The statistically suspicious distribution of p-values clustering just below .05\n3) The documented pressure and motivation in her emails\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record, the technical evidence of altered preregistration and non-random p-value distribution represent clear research integrity violations that are difficult to explain through innocent means. These specific patterns are widely recognized as indicators of deliberate data manipulation or p-hacking."
