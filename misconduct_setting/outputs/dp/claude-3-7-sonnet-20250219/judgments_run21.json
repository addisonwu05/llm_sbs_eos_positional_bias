  "Yes. Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious violation of research ethics. This, combined with the suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05, the pattern of participant exclusions, and her emails expressing the need for positive results, collectively presents compelling evidence of intentional data manipulation. While some factors like her previously clean record provide context, they don't outweigh the strong indicators of misconduct in this specific high-pressure study."
