The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is not misconduct but rather good scientific practice to ensure data quality.\n\nThe key details here are:\n1. The exclusions were documented in raw data files\n2. These notes predate any journal submission\n3. There were legitimate reasons noted (falling asleep, not understanding instructions)\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be completely normal and expected to:\n- Note participant issues during data collection\n- Document these issues in raw data files\n- Make exclusion decisions based on pre-defined criteria\n- Apply these exclusions before analysis and submission\n\nThe timing of the documentation (predating submission) is particularly important, as it suggests these were real-time observations rather than post-hoc justifications. Proper documentation of exclusions in the original data files is exactly what one would expect from a researcher following good scientific practices.\n\nGiven that excluding participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions is standard practice, and the documentation appears to have been created at the appropriate time, this particular aspect of the case is highly consistent with proper research conduct.\n\nProbability: 90"

A researcher fabricating data might include some \"realistic\" exclusions to make the dataset appear more authentic, as perfect data completion rates would look suspicious. Creating documentation of typical exclusion reasons (falling asleep, misunderstanding instructions) would be part of creating a believable fabricated dataset.\n\n2. She might have conducted the study legitimately but then selectively excluded participants to achieve desired results. In this case, she might have documented real exclusions properly but perhaps exaggerated their severity to justify removing data points that didn't fit her hypothesis.\n\n3. She could have backdated the exclusion notes after seeing the data, making it appear as though the decisions were made prior to analysis when they were actually post-hoc decisions to improve results.\n\nThe fact that the notes predate the journal submission doesn't fully exonerate her if misconduct occurred, as dates on digital files can sometimes be manipulated, or notes could be added to original files later while preserving earlier timestamps.\n\nHowever, fabricating exclusion documentation adds complexity and risk to misconduct. A researcher committing fraud might choose simpler methods like direct data manipulation rather than creating an elaborate paper trail of exclusions.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit misconduct, it's moderately likely she would have documented these specific exclusions in a way that predates submission, as part of creating a convincing dataset or justifying selective data use.\n\nProbability: 60"

Here's why this pattern strongly suggests misconduct:\n\n1. **P-hacking signature**: This distribution is precisely what emerges when researchers try multiple analyses until finding ones that yield \"significant\" results. Researchers engaged in misconduct typically stop analyzing when they cross the significance threshold, resulting in many values just below .05.\n\n2. **Selective reporting**: If someone tests multiple analyses but only reports those that achieve significance, this exact clustering pattern emerges.

Exploratory analyses offer maximum flexibility for adjusting parameters, exclusion criteria, or statistical approaches until desired results emerge.\n\n4. **Statistical implausibility**: This distribution is statistically highly unlikely to occur naturally. If the analyses were conducted and reported without bias, we would expect a more uniform distribution around the threshold.\n\n5. **Methodological fingerprint**: This pattern has been so well-established as evidence of questionable practices that it's used in meta-analyses to detect publication bias and p-hacking across scientific fields.\n\nIf Lena were engaged in misconduct such as selectively reporting analyses, trying multiple analytical approaches until finding significant results, or adjusting parameters to push marginally non-significant results into significance, this exact p-value distribution would be the expected outcome.

In fact, comparing earlier versus final versions of analyses is one of the primary methods used by investigators to detect potential misconduct.\n\nIf Lena were engaged in misconduct, progressively excluding participants until achieving statistical significance would be an effective and unfortunately common approach. The automated backup revealing this earlier version with more participants would provide strong evidence of this process.\n\nThis scenario aligns extremely well with established patterns of data manipulation in academic research.\n\nProbability: 95"

The entire point of preregistration is to document decisions about study design, analysis plans, and outcome measures before data collection to prevent various forms of bias and p-hacking.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, this scenario is highly problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Violates core principles**: Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from changing their analysis plans after seeing their data. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly contradicts this purpose.\n\n2. **Timing issue**: The timestamps provide objective evidence that changes were made after data collection, which is a serious breach of research protocol regardless of intent.\n\n3. **Critical modifications**: The changes weren't minor technical corrections but involved exclusion criteria (which determine which data points are analyzed) and primary outcomes (the main results of the study). These are precisely the elements that should not be modified after seeing the data.\n\n4. **Transparency violation**: Proper scientific practice would require any post-data collection changes to be transparently reported as deviations from the preregistration, not modifications to the preregistration itself.\n\nEven if Lena had no intent to manipulate results, modifying a preregistration document after data collection is, by definition, a serious breach of research protocols. It undermines the very purpose of preregistration and creates significant concerns about research integrity.\n\nWhile honest mistakes can occur in research, this specific action—modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes in a preregistration after data collection—is exceptionally difficult to reconcile with proper scientific conduct and would be highly unlikely without some form of misconduct.\n\nProbability: 5"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be highly consistent with deliberate research fraud. Let me explain why:\n\n1. **HARKing enablement**: This modification would allow Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing), one of the most serious forms of research misconduct. By changing the preregistration, Lena could make it appear that findings were predicted in advance when they were actually discovered after looking at the data.\n\n2. **Strategic outcome selection**: Changing primary outcomes after seeing the data is a classic method of ensuring \"significant\" results by selecting the measures that happened to show the desired effects.\n\n3. **Data exclusion justification**: Modifying exclusion criteria after data collection would allow Lena to legitimize the removal of participants or data points that didn't support her hypothesis.\n\n4. **Creating false documentation**: Altering the preregistration creates a false paper trail that makes post-hoc decisions appear to have been made a priori, deliberately misleading reviewers and readers.\n\n5. **Circumventing safeguards**: Preregistration exists specifically to prevent p-hacking and researcher degrees of freedom. Changing it after data collection deliberately undermines this scientific safeguard.\n\n6. **Concealment attempt**: The modification of timestamps suggests awareness that this action was improper and an attempt to obscure the timing of these changes.\n\nThis type of modification represents a calculated effort to make post-hoc decisions appear to have been planned from the beginning. It's one of the most direct forms of research fraud because it specifically targets and undermines a system (preregistration) that was designed to prevent such manipulation.\n\nIf Lena were engaged in deliberate misconduct, modifying the preregistration would be an extremely effective way to make her results appear more credible while hiding questionable analytical decisions. This action shows both intent and understanding of how to circumvent scientific integrity measures.\n\nProbability: 95"

This is extremely difficult to explain innocently.\n\n2. **Unusual p-value distribution:** The clustering of p-values just below .05 (with almost none above) in exploratory analyses is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking that rarely occurs naturally.\n\n3. **Participant exclusion patterns:** The earlier analysis script included more participants than the final analysis, suggesting potential selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **High-pressure context:** Lena's emails reveal she was under significant pressure from both her supervisor and personal career concerns, providing clear motive.\n\n**Evidence suggesting no misconduct:**\n\n1. **Previously clean record:** Lena's earlier work passed independent data audits and was rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. **Legitimate exclusions:** The excluded participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions were documented before submission.\n\n3. **Technical issues:** The software switch and verified hard drive failure provide some explanation for file inconsistencies.\n\n4. **Lab-wide practices:** Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria matched patterns from other students in the lab.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the suspicious p-value distribution. These are very difficult to explain without misconduct and represent serious violations of scientific integrity. The documented pressure and statements about \"needing this one to work\" establish clear motive.\n\nWhile Lena's previous clean record suggests she understood proper research practices, this actually strengthens the case that any violations would be deliberate rather than due to ignorance. The technical issues and lab-wide practices provide some context but don't explain the most serious concerns.\n\nThe pattern of evidence collectively points to deliberate p-hacking at minimum, with the preregistration modification suggesting a calculated attempt to hide this process.\n\nProbability: 85"
