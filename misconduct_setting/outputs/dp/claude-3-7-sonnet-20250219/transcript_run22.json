The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Researchers who maintain good data practices typically do so consistently across projects. The fact that her work was previously rated well suggests she has established proper scientific methods and documentation practices.\n\nHowever, we need to consider alternative explanations:\n- It's possible for someone to have good practices initially and then later commit misconduct due to pressure\n- The previous audit might not have been as thorough as the current investigation\n- Her previous projects might have been simpler or faced less pressure\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the likelihood of her previous good record IF she did not commit misconduct in the current case. If she is innocent in the current case, then her previous good record would be consistent with her overall approach to research.\n\nGiven that the premise assumes Lena did not commit academic misconduct in the current study, it would be quite likely that her previous studies were genuinely well-documented and reproducible. The consistency between past and present behavior would be expected if she maintains scientific integrity throughout her career.\n\nProbability: 90"

Robustness testing: The information explicitly states there was a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness.\" This is a methodologically sound practice in science, where researchers test whether their findings hold under different analytical approaches.\n\n2. Standard practice in the lab: The information notes that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\" This suggests this was a normal, accepted practice in the research environment, not something unusual or suspicious.\n\n3. Exploratory analysis: In cognitive neuroscience research, it's common to explore data with different parameters to understand sensitivity to analytical choices.\n\n4. Transparency in analysis: Storing all versions of analyses, including those with stricter and looser criteria, can actually be a sign of transparency rather than misconduct.\n\n5. Response to methodological developments: As scientific standards evolve, researchers often test multiple exclusion criteria to understand how different standards affect results.\n\nIf Lena were not committing misconduct, we would expect her analytical behavior to match lab norms and good scientific practices for robustness testing. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports the interpretation that this was standard procedure, not evidence of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nExploratory analyses only become problematic when they're misrepresented as confirmatory or when researchers selectively report only favorable outcomes without appropriate statistical corrections. The mere presence of multiple analysis scripts is consistent with thorough, transparent research practices.\n\nProbability: 90"

Cover for p-hacking: Multiple analysis versions could provide cover for selective reporting. By running analyses with various exclusion criteria, she could choose the version that produced the most favorable results without explicitly fabricating data. This would be difficult to detect precisely because it mirrors legitimate robustness testing.\n\n2. Camouflage within lab practices: If the entire lab routinely runs multiple analyses, this provides perfect camouflage for misconduct. Her behavior wouldn't stand out since it matches what other students do, making questionable practices harder to detect.\n\n3. Finding the \"right\" exclusion criteria: She could have been searching for specific exclusion parameters that would yield significant results to support the theory being tested, especially given the pressure for publishable findings before the grant review.\n\n4. Retroactive justification: After potentially manipulating data, she might run legitimate-looking alternative analyses to make the selected approach seem like one of many reasonable options considered.\n\n5. Partial misconduct: She might have conducted most analyses legitimately while selectively manipulating a small portion, with the multiple scripts serving as documentation of apparently thorough work.\n\nThe pattern described - storing multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - is precisely what we might expect from someone engaging in a sophisticated form of p-hacking or selective reporting. The fact that this behavior matches lab norms makes it an ideal cover for misconduct rather than evidence against it.\n\nIf she were committing misconduct, maintaining analysis logs similar to peers would be a rational strategy to avoid suspicion, making this pattern quite likely even in the case of misconduct.\n\nProbability: 80"

Proper documentation timing: The fact that the notes about these participants predate any journal submission is crucial. This timing indicates that these exclusions were made during the normal data collection and processing phase, not retroactively after seeing results or during reviewer revisions.\n\n2. Valid exclusion criteria: Participants falling asleep or not understanding task instructions are universally accepted reasons for exclusion in cognitive studies. These issues fundamentally compromise data quality since:\n   - A sleeping participant cannot properly engage with the memory task\n   - A participant who misunderstands instructions is not performing the intended experimental task\n\n3. Transparent documentation: The exclusions were documented in raw data files, not hidden or applied silently. This transparency is consistent with proper scientific practice.\n\n4. Expected frequency: In a study with 80 participants, having two participants (2.5%) with attention or comprehension issues is completely within normal ranges. Cognitive tasks often have a small percentage of participants who struggle with task demands.\n\n5. Consistent with methodological standards: In cognitive neuroscience, documenting participant compliance issues at the time they occur and excluding compromised data is standard procedure.\n\nIf Lena were conducting research properly, we would expect exactly this kind of careful, contemporaneous documentation of valid exclusion reasons.

The independent IT confirmation particularly strengthens the credibility of the hard drive failure claim.\n\nIf Lena was conducting honest research, these kinds of ordinary technical and methodological challenges would be expected to occur at roughly the same rate as they would for any researcher.

They demonstrate that Lena was acutely aware of the personal and professional stakes involved and felt a compelling need for specific results rather than merely accurate ones.\n\nIf she did commit misconduct, these emails would represent a textbook example of the psychological preconditions typically documented in confirmed cases.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely this unusual p-value distribution would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe described pattern - an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 - is statistically suspicious for several reasons:\n\n1. Expected p-value distribution: Under normal statistical conditions with genuine effects, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is false, we would typically see many small p-values (well below .05) rather than a clustering just below the significance threshold.\n\n2. Discontinuity at .05: The described pattern shows a sharp discontinuity exactly at the conventional significance threshold (.05). If analyses were conducted without p-hacking, we would expect to see approximately equal numbers of p-values just below and just above .05 (e.g., as many values around .051-.059 as around .041-.049).\n\n3. Multiple exploratory analyses: The pattern appears across \"several exploratory analyses.\" Exploratory analyses are particularly vulnerable to researcher degrees of freedom, making this clustering even more suspicious.\n\nThis pattern is widely recognized in the scientific community as a red flag for p-hacking - the practice of manipulating analyses until results become statistically significant. The absence of p-values just above .05 strongly suggests that analyses that initially yielded \"almost significant\" results were reworked until they crossed the significance threshold.\n\nMeta-scientific research examining published literature has identified exactly this pattern as evidence of widespread p-hacking across fields. While there are theoretical scenarios where such clustering might occur naturally, they are extremely unlikely, especially across multiple analyses.\n\nGiven all the other concerns raised about this research (modified preregistration, participant exclusions, etc.), this p-value pattern is particularly difficult to explain through legitimate research processes.\n\nProbability: 5"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the described p-value distribution would be highly consistent with common forms of data manipulation and p-hacking.\n\nThis p-value pattern - many values just below .05 (.047, .049, .041) and almost none just above .05 - is essentially a statistical fingerprint of certain types of misconduct:\n\n1. Selective analysis: This distribution strongly suggests trying multiple analytical approaches until finding ones that yield p < .05. When researchers engage in this practice, analyses yielding p-values just above .05 (e.g., .051, .053) are typically discarded or modified until they cross the significance threshold.\n\n2. Strategic exclusion of participants: Removing specific participants whose data weakens an effect until the p-value drops below .05 creates exactly this pattern. This aligns with the earlier evidence showing participant exclusions between earlier and later analysis versions.\n\n3. Flexible stopping rules: Running analyses repeatedly during data collection and stopping when results become significant creates a clustering of p-values just below the threshold.\n\n4. Multiple testing without proper correction: Running numerous \"exploratory analyses\" and selectively reporting only the significant ones produces this distribution.\n\n5. Parameter tuning: Adjusting model parameters, exclusion criteria, or covariates until getting desired results is a form of misconduct that generates this pattern.\n\nThis p-value distribution is so widely recognized as evidence of questionable practices that it has been used in large-scale analyses to estimate the prevalence of p-hacking across scientific fields. It's particularly telling in combination with the other evidence we've seen:\n- Modified preregistration after data collection\n- Changing exclusion criteria\n- Selective participant exclusion\n- High-pressure context described in emails\n\nThe statistical pattern described would be exactly what we'd expect to see if Lena were manipulating analyses to ensure significant results, especially across \"several exploratory analyses\" where researcher degrees of freedom are greatest.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "I'll systematically evaluate the evidence to assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a serious breach of research integrity.\n\n2. **Unusual p-value distribution**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above. This pattern is a well-established statistical fingerprint of p-hacking.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions**: Participants present in earlier analysis scripts were excluded from the final dataset, potentially indicating selective removal to strengthen results.\n\n4. **Motive and pressure**: Emails show clear evidence of pressure and motivation for misconduct. Lena wrote that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and that she \"needs this one to work.\"\n\n**Evidence providing context but compatible with either scenario:**\n\n5. **Multiple analysis scripts**: The lab was exploring robustness with various exclusion criteria, and other students showed similar patterns. This could be legitimate practice or cover for p-hacking.\n\n6. **Software switch and hard drive failure**: While providing a potential explanation for missing files, these events could also create opportunities to obscure evidence of misconduct.\n\n**Evidence suggesting proper research practices:**\n\n7. **Previously strong record**: Lena's earlier projects passed an independent data audit and were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n8. **Proper exclusion documentation**: Two participants were excluded based on notes that predate journal submission, showing appropriate contemporaneous documentation.\n\nWhen weighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modification of the preregistration after data collection and the unusual p-value distribution. These are difficult to explain through legitimate research practices. Combined with documented motive and the pattern of participant exclusions, there is substantial evidence supporting misconduct.\n\nThe most favorable evidence for Lena is her previously strong record, but this doesn't outweigh the specific evidence regarding this particular study.\n\nProbability: 85"

The most damning evidence includes the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, the statistically suspicious distribution of p-values clustered just below .05, and the pattern of participant exclusions between early and final analyses. These methodological issues are accompanied by clear evidence of motive and pressure in Lena's emails.\n\nWhile some contextual factors like software changes and her previously good record provide some counterbalance, they don't adequately explain the specific pattern of problematic research practices observed in this study. The totality of evidence points to deliberate manipulation of analyses and data to achieve desired significant results rather than honest errors or coincidences."
