The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made as part of the data cleaning or preprocessing step, before the data analysis that would lead to the study's conclusions.\n\nGiven the context, it is reasonable to expect that a researcher following proper and honest practices would exclude participants who did not properly engage with the task. Thus, the occurrence of excluding two such participants based on pre-existing notes is not only possible but also likely in the context of a study involving 80 participants.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that two such participants would be excluded based on notes predating the journal submission, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is relatively high.\n\n80"

However, if Lena had actually fabricated the entire dataset or manipulated the outcomes, she might not have bothered to maintain a record of participant exclusion that is consistent with legitimate research practices, or she might have ensured that such records supported her manipulated results.\n\nThe fact that the notes predating the journal submission support the exclusion of the two participants suggests that, even if Lena committed misconduct elsewhere in the study (e.g., in data analysis or reporting), she either did not manipulate these particular records or did so in a way that coincidentally aligned with legitimate reasons for exclusion.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is still plausible that genuine or fabricated notes predating the journal submission could justify excluding participants. However, the likelihood depends on whether her misconduct involved fabricating records of participant exclusion. If she fabricated data or manipulated results, it is possible she could have also fabricated the notes or the exclusion criteria.
