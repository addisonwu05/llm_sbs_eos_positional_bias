The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, considering the balance of the evidence, it seems that there are significant concerns but also some mitigating factors.\n\n60"
