The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The switch from one statistical software package to another is not unusual, especially if the project is long-term or if there are changes in personnel or research direction. The timing of such a switch (e.g., halfway through a project) could be due to various factors, including new project requirements or the adoption of new standards within the field or lab.\n\n2. **Lena's Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: Hardware failures are not uncommon with heavy computer use. Researchers often work with large datasets and run complex analyses that can be demanding on computer hardware. Laptops, in particular, are prone to hardware failures due to their portable nature, exposure to various environments, and potential overheating issues. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure and its repair supports the authenticity of Lena's claim, indicating that the incident was documented and addressed.\n\nGiven these considerations, both events (software switch and hard drive failure) have plausible, innocuous explanations that are unrelated to academic misconduct. Labs switching software is a relatively common occurrence due to evolving research needs or technological advancements. Hardware failures, including hard drive failures, are also not unusual, especially in environments with heavy computer usage.\n\nTherefore, it is plausible that these events occurred without being related to any misconduct by Lena.\n\nThe probability that these events would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is: 70"

It's more related to lab-wide or project-specific decisions, potentially influenced by factors like new methodologies, software capabilities, or team preferences. An individual committing misconduct wouldn't directly cause a lab to switch software.\n\n2. **Lena's Laptop Hard Drive Failure**: While an individual could potentially damage their laptop or fabricate a story about a hard drive failure to cover their tracks, the IT department's confirmation of a reported and repaired hardware failure around the relevant time frame suggests that the failure was genuine. It's improbable that Lena would be able to fabricate evidence of a hard drive failure that is confirmed by the IT department, as this would require collusion or a failure in the IT department's processes.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the occurrence of these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) is largely independent of her actions. The lab's decision to switch software and a genuine hardware failure are not directly related to whether or not Lena manipulated data. The confirmation by the IT department adds credibility to the hard drive failure being genuine.\n\nThus, the likelihood of these events happening is not significantly influenced by whether Lena committed misconduct. They are relatively plausible regardless of her actions.\n\nThe probability that these events would occur if Lena did commit academic misconduct is: 65"

This context makes it plausible that Lena, along with other students, was following a standard or recommended practice.\n\n2. **Similarity to other students' practices**: The observation that other students in the lab showed similar patterns in their scripts further supports the notion that running multiple analyses with varying exclusion criteria was a common or accepted practice within the lab. This similarity reduces the likelihood that Lena's behavior was unusual or indicative of misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is entirely plausible that she would be following the lab's practices and guidelines, which included exploring the robustness of her findings through different analytical approaches.

This could involve testing different exclusion criteria to see which yields the most favorable outcome. In this context, running multiple scripts could be a part of the process of manipulating data or analyses to obtain statistically significant or otherwise desirable results.\n\n2. **Covering tracks or genuine practice**: If Lena was committing misconduct, she might still follow lab practices or create the appearance of doing so to avoid raising suspicion.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the mindset and behavior of someone who engages in misconduct.\n\n1. **Pressure and motivation**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it could be driven by the pressure she felt to produce significant results, as expressed in her emails. The pressure to succeed, coupled with the perceived stakes (e.g., impact on her postdoc chances), might motivate her to engage in misconduct.\n\n2. **Awareness of stakes**: The emails suggest that Lena was aware of the high stakes associated with the study's outcome. This awareness could contribute to a motivation to manipulate results, especially if she felt that a null result would have severe consequences for her career.\n\n3. **Expression of pressure as a precursor to misconduct**: The fact that Lena expressed her pressure and the importance of the study's success in emails could be seen as a precursor to her potential actions. It indicates that she was under significant stress and felt a strong need to succeed.\n\nIf Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is plausible that she would be under considerable pressure and that this pressure would be reflected in her communications. The emails could be an honest reflection of her feelings and the context in which she decided to engage in misconduct.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that someone who commits academic misconduct under such pressure would also express those pressures and concerns in personal communications.\n\nThe probability that she would write such emails if she did commit academic misconduct is: 90"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to synthesize the various pieces of information.\n\n1. **Lab and personal circumstances**: The pressure Lena was under (as indicated by her emails) and the importance of the study for her career and the lab's grant could have motivated misconduct. However, being under pressure doesn't necessarily imply misconduct.\n\n2. **Data and analysis practices**: The presence of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the exclusion of participants in the final dataset are all concerning and could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n3. **Evidence of good practices**: Lena's previous studies were well-documented and reproducible, and she had passed an independent data audit. This history suggests that she has generally followed good research practices.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies and explanations**: The lab's data management logs showed that Lena ran multiple analysis scripts, which could be seen as part of a legitimate exploratory process. The exclusion of certain participants was based on pre-existing notes, which is a valid research practice.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are several red flags (e.g., unusual distribution of p-values, post-data collection modification of preregistration), there are also explanations that could justify these actions as part of legitimate research practices. However, the combination of these factors, especially the unusual p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document, raises significant suspicions.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence and the complexities involved, a definitive judgment is challenging. However, leaning on the side of caution and considering the totality of the evidence, it seems plausible that Lena could have committed some form of academic misconduct, particularly related to the handling of analyses and reporting.\n\nThe probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is: 60"
