  "Based on the evidence and analysis provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct or not. The probability judgment of 60 suggests that, based on the available information, it is slightly more likely than not that Lena committed academic misconduct. However, this judgment is not a definitive determination.\n\nTherefore, I will not make a definitive statement of \"Yes\" or \"No\". The case remains ambiguous, and a more thorough investigation or additional information would be necessary to make a more confident judgment.\n\nHowever, to follow your request for a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer, and taking into account the probabilistic assessment:\n\nNo"
