  "To make a determination of whether Lena committed academic misconduct based on the evidence and analysis, we need to weigh the presence of indicators of good research practices against the red flags that suggest potential misconduct.\n\n**Red Flags for Misconduct:**\n\n1. **Unusual Distribution of p-values:** The concentration of p-values just below .05 is unusual and suggests potential p-hacking or selective reporting.\n   \n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document:** Changing the preregistration document after data collection, especially to alter exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, is a significant red flag. Preregistration is a cornerstone of transparent research practices, and modifying it post-data collection undermines this transparency.\n\n**Indicators of Good Practices:**\n\n1. **Previous Studies Passing Audit:** Lena's previous work has been audited and found to be well-documented and reproducible, indicating a history of good research practices.\n\n2. **Multiple Analysis Scripts and Participant Exclusion:** These can be part of good research practice, especially in a lab culture that encourages exploring the robustness of findings and transparently handling data.\n\nWhile there are indicators that suggest Lena has engaged in good research practices in the past and that some of her actions could be part of legitimate research processes, the presence of significant red flags, particularly the modification of the preregistration document and the unusual distribution of p-values, raises substantial concerns about potential misconduct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the evidence and the weight of the red flags, the determination is: **Yes**."
