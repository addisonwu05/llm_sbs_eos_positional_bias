The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the information given and its implications.\n\nFirst, we are told that Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. This suggests that, up until the point of the current investigation, her work had been considered acceptable and free from significant issues related to data handling or integrity.\n\nSecond, it's mentioned that her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before. Passing an independent audit implies that her data handling practices were scrutinized by external or internal auditors and found to be satisfactory. The fact that her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible” further supports the notion that she maintained good practices in her research.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct in her current study, it implies that any issues found are likely due to unintentional errors or misunderstandings rather than deliberate actions to manipulate or fabricate data. The fact that her previous work was audited and found to be in good order suggests a consistent level of professionalism and adherence to good research practices.\n\nThe key question is whether her clean record and the positive audit outcome are consistent with the hypothesis that she did not commit misconduct in the current instance. If Lena is generally diligent and honest in her research practices, as evidenced by her past work and audit results, it is reasonable to expect that her current study, while potentially containing errors, would not involve intentional misconduct.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly plausible that her previous studies would have been conducted with the same level of integrity and attention to detail, resulting in them passing an independent data audit and being rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nGiven this, the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct is very high, because it aligns with the characterization of her as having a previously strong record of careful data handling.\n\n90"

However, the fact that her previous studies were found to be well-documented and reproducible during an independent audit suggests that either she did not engage in misconduct in those studies or that she was able to successfully conceal it.\n\nResearch on academic misconduct suggests that individuals who commit misconduct can sometimes have a history of acceptable or even exemplary behavior, as they may be able to maintain a facade of integrity while concealing their wrongdoing. However, it's also possible that an individual might start committing misconduct at some point in their career, potentially due to increasing pressures or opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Lena's earlier work was audited and found satisfactory indicates that either she was not engaging in misconduct at that time or that the misconduct was not detectable through the audit process. Some individuals who commit misconduct may be able to hide their actions well enough to avoid detection, at least for a period.\n\nHowever, if Lena did commit misconduct in the current study, it somewhat strains credulity to think that she had never done so before, especially if the pressures or motivations that led to the current alleged misconduct were also present in her previous work. On the other hand, it's possible that the current study represented a singular lapse or a response to particularly intense pressure.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the likelihood that her previous studies would still have passed an audit and been rated highly seems lower than if she hadn't committed misconduct, because it implies a change in behavior or an ability to hide misconduct in the past. However, it's still plausible that she hadn't engaged in detectable misconduct before.\n\nThe probability judgment should reflect the notion that committing misconduct in one instance doesn't necessarily mean all previous work was tainted, but it might suggest a higher risk or a change in behavior.\n\n20"

Labs often update their software or switch between different packages for various reasons, including improvements in functionality, compatibility issues, or changes in the research focus. While it might be inconvenient and potentially problematic, switching software is a plausible occurrence.\n\nSecond, hardware failures, including laptop hard drive failures, are also not uncommon. Electronic devices can fail due to a variety of reasons such as manufacturing defects, wear and tear, or physical damage. If Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure, this could reasonably result in some missing files, especially if backups were not regularly performed or were not comprehensive.\n\nThe fact that the IT department confirms a hardware failure was reported and repaired around the time in question adds credibility to the explanation that the missing files were due to a genuine technical issue rather than an attempt to conceal data.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the occurrence of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) is somewhat unfortunate but not implausible. They could reasonably happen due to circumstances unrelated to any wrongdoing on Lena's part.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that these events occurred without being related to academic misconduct is relatively high, as they can be explained by plausible, mundane reasons.\n\n70"

However, fabricating a hard drive failure or convincing the IT department to confirm a hardware failure that didn't actually happen might be difficult and risky.\n\nSwitching software during a project is a plausible event, as discussed earlier, and could happen regardless of whether misconduct occurred. \n\nThe fabrication of a hard drive failure, while not impossible, would require Lena to either actually cause the failure (which is unethical and potentially illegal) or to convincingly fabricate evidence of a failure. The fact that the IT department confirms the hardware failure suggests that if it was fabricated, it was done so convincingly.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the software switch and the hard drive failure are coincidental and unrelated to any misconduct. \n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, one might argue that she could have fabricated the hard drive failure story to explain discrepancies or missing data. Nonetheless, the IT department's confirmation of the failure reduces the likelihood that the failure was entirely fabricated.\n\nThe probability that these events (a genuine software switch and a confirmed hard drive failure) occurred is somewhat independent of whether Lena committed misconduct, as both events have plausible explanations unrelated to misconduct.\n\nTherefore, while the coincidence of these events might be seen as convenient for Lena if she had committed misconduct, attributing them directly to misconduct is not straightforward.\n\n50"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the behaviors and outcomes associated with such misconduct.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, such as p-hacking, selective reporting, or data manipulation, it could directly influence the distribution of p-values. Misconduct aimed at achieving statistically significant results (i.e., p < .05) could result in an unusually high concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold.\n\nP-hacking, for instance, involves analyzing the data in multiple ways and selectively reporting the analyses that yield statistically significant results. This practice can lead to an inflated number of p-values just below .05.\n\nSelective reporting, where only significant results are reported while non-significant ones are not, can also contribute to this pattern. If Lena committed such misconduct, it would likely result in a dataset where many p-values are just below .05, with fewer p-values just above .05 being reported.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, such as p-hacking or selective reporting, it is highly likely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\n90"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, we need to weigh the various pieces of information provided.\n\n1. **Lena's past record**: She has a previously strong record of careful data handling, and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit. This suggests that she is generally competent and potentially honest in her research practices.\n\n2. **Software switch and hard drive failure**: The lab switched statistical software, and Lena's laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure. While these events could be coincidental, they could also be seen as potentially convenient for Lena if she had committed misconduct.\n\n3. **Running multiple analyses**: Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, a practice that was encouraged in the lab and consistent with other students' behaviors. This suggests she was following lab norms.\n\n4. **Exclusion of participants**: Two participants were excluded based on notes that predated the journal submission, indicating that the exclusion was likely done in good faith.\n\n5. **Emails expressing pressure**: Lena expressed concerns about the study's importance and the pressure she was under. While this indicates she was under stress, it doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\n6. **Modification of preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a red flag as it goes against the principles of preregistration.\n\n7. **Earlier analysis script**: An earlier version of the analysis script included more participants who were later excluded. This could indicate a legitimate refinement of the analysis or potentially something more questionable.\n\n8. **Distribution of p-values**: The final dataset showed an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05. This is a significant red flag, as it suggests potential p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nConsidering these points, several red flags are raised, particularly the modification of the preregistration document after data collection and the suspicious distribution of p-values. These suggest potential academic misconduct.\n\nHowever, there are also indications that Lena followed standard lab practices and had a previously clean record.\n\nGiven the evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct seems significant due to the presence of several red flags. However, it's not certain, as some of the evidence can be interpreted in more than one way.\n\n60"
