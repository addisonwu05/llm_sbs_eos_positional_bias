While there are some suspicious patterns, such as the unusual distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, there are also plausible explanations for some of the irregularities, and Lena has a previously clean record.\n\nGiven the complexity of the case and the mixed evidence, I would not make a definitive judgment. However, if I had to provide a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer based on the probability being above or below 50, I would say:\n\nYes"
