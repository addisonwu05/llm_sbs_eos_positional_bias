    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This aligns with standard scientific practice, where data integrity and adherence to the study protocol are crucial.\n\n2. **Common Practice**: In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, it is common to exclude participants who fail to follow instructions or fall asleep during the task. These exclusions are often documented in the raw data files to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n3. **Pattern Consistency**: If the notes are consistent with the lab’s typical procedures for handling such issues, it would be reasonable to assume that these exclusions were part of the standard data cleaning process.\n\n4. **Pressure and Timing**: The pressure to produce publishable results does not necessarily mean that every decision made is driven by that pressure. If the notes were made before the submission, it suggests that the exclusions were based on the data and not on a desire to manipulate the results.\n\nGiven these points, the likelihood that the exclusions are legitimate and not the result of academic misconduct is high.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Pre-existing Notes**: If Lena was committing misconduct, it would be more difficult to create pre-existing notes that appear genuine and consistent with the timeline. Fabricated or falsified data often leaves traces that can be detected, such as inconsistencies in the data or timestamps.\n\n2. **Timing and Pressure**: If Lena was under pressure to produce publishable results, she might have been more likely to manipulate data after the initial data collection or during the analysis phase. Pre-dating notes to justify exclusions would be a more sophisticated form of fraud, which is less common and riskier to execute without detection.\n\n3. **Mundane Explanations**: The lab’s recent switch in software and the hard drive failure could provide plausible explanations for some irregularities, but these do not explain the pre-dating of exclusion notes. If Lena was committing misconduct, she would have to be extremely meticulous to avoid leaving any traces, which is less likely.\n\n4. **Consistency with Protocol**: If the notes are consistent with the lab’s standard protocol for handling such issues, it would be more difficult to argue that they were part of a fraudulent scheme.

This pattern is often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"p-value fishing,\" where researchers might engage in practices to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Random Distribution**: In genuine, unbiased data, p-values should be uniformly distributed across the range from 0 to 1.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Manipulating Results**: One common form of misconduct is to include or exclude participants to achieve desired results. Lena might have started with a larger dataset in the initial analysis and then excluded certain participants to manipulate the outcomes and achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Covering Tracks**: By including more participants in an earlier script, Lena could create the appearance of a thorough and comprehensive analysis. Later excluding certain participants could help to cover up the manipulation and make the final results seem more legitimate.\n\n3. **Pressure and Motivation**: Given the high stakes described in Lena's emails, such as her supervisor’s expectations and her career prospects, the motivation to manipulate the data is strong. Excluding participants who do not support the desired results could be a tactic to ensure the study meets these expectations.\n\n4. **Consistency with Other Suspicious Patterns**: The presence of other suspicious patterns, such as the unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and the modification of the preregistration document, supports the possibility that Lena engaged in multiple forms of misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is relatively high. Based on the information provided, the probability is around 80%.\n\n80"

Here’s a summary of the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant breach of transparency and trust, strongly suggesting misconduct.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: The presence of additional participants in an earlier analysis script and their exclusion in the final dataset, combined with the need to achieve significant results, suggests potential manipulation to align with desired outcomes.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**: The emails indicating high pressure from her supervisor and the importance of the study for her career prospects provide a strong motive for misconduct.\n\n5. **File and Data Irregularities**: The hard drive failure and the lab’s recent software switch, while not conclusive, could be used to cover up or explain away potential irregularities.\n\n6. **Suspicious Patterns**: The combination of multiple suspicious patterns, including the p-value distribution and the modification of the preregistration document, increases the likelihood of misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 70%.\n\n70"
