The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the likelihood of this occurring is lower compared to the scenario where she did not commit misconduct. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Covering Tracks**: If Lena fabricated or manipulated data, she might try to cover her tracks by creating the appearance of thorough and robust analysis. This might involve running and storing multiple scripts to make her work look more legitimate. However, this kind of behavior is riskier and more difficult to maintain without leaving suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Standard Practice**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that running and storing multiple analysis scripts is a standard practice. If Lena was aware of this, she might mimic this behavior to blend in and avoid drawing suspicion.\n\n3. **Technical Artifacts**: Even if Lena committed misconduct, technical artifacts and lab protocols might still result in the creation of multiple scripts. For example, software changes, data processing routines, and lab guidelines might require or encourage the creation of multiple scripts.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple scripts alone is not a strong indicator of misconduct. It is more likely that other factors, such as inconsistent data patterns or discrepancies in the analysis history, would be the primary indicators of potential misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the lab’s data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts, even if she committed academic misconduct, is moderate but not as high as if she did not commit misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

These notes help in maintaining transparency and providing a clear rationale for any data exclusions. The fact that these notes predate the journal submission suggests that the exclusions were made as part of the initial data processing, not as a response to reviewers' comments or to manipulate results.\n\n3. **Consistency with Best Practices**: The lab’s practice of documenting exclusions in the raw data files aligns with best practices in research methodology. This practice helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and provides a clear audit trail for any external review.\n\nGiven these factors, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is very likely that the exclusions would be documented and predate the journal submission.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software is a common and legitimate practice in research, often driven by the need for better tools or new features. If Lena committed misconduct, she might use the switch as a cover, but the timing and nature of the switch would need to align with legitimate reasons, which could be less likely if she was trying to manipulate data.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure is a common technical issue that can happen to anyone. However, if Lena committed misconduct, the failure could be seen as a convenient way to hide or explain away missing data or altered files. The IT department confirming the failure and repair adds credibility to this event, but it also means that any manipulation would need to be carefully planned to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Combination of Events**: The combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure could provide a convenient cover for misconduct, but it also increases the complexity and risk of being caught.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: One common form of misconduct is p-hacking, which involves manipulating data or analysis methods to achieve statistically significant results (p < .05). This can lead to an unnatural concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Another form of misconduct is selectively reporting results that are significant while omitting those that are not. This can create a pattern where p-values cluster just below .05 and are rare just above .05.\n\n3. **Data Manipulation**: Directly altering data to produce significant results can also result in p-values clustering just below the .05 threshold. This can be done by adjusting data points, excluding certain participants, or changing analysis criteria.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**: Given the high stakes mentioned in Lena's emails, the pressure to produce significant results could motivate her to engage in these practices. The pattern of p-values just below .05 can be a result of her efforts to meet these expectations.\n\n5. **Statistical Anomalies**: While such a pattern is a red flag and can be detected, researchers who engage in misconduct often take the risk to achieve their goals. The pattern is more consistent with deliberate manipulation than with natural variation in data.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is moderate to high. Here are the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Preregistration Modification**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant red flag. This suggests a potential attempt to manipulate the study to achieve desired results.\n\n2. **Unusual P-Value Distribution**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is highly suspicious. This pattern is indicative of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n3. **High Stakes and Motivation**: Lena’s emails indicate significant pressure and motivation to produce significant results. The high stakes and personal investment in the study’s success could have driven her to engage in misconduct.\n\n4. **Data Irregularities and Exclusions**: The presence of earlier analysis scripts with more participants and the exclusion of some participants in the final dataset, combined with the lab’s switch to new software and a hard drive failure, could be seen as convenient cover for potential data manipulation.\n\n5. **Whistleblower Claims and Inquiry**: The concerns raised by the whistleblower and the subsequent internal inquiry add credibility to the possibility of misconduct. While the whistleblower's claims alone are not conclusive, they warrant serious consideration.\n\n6. **Previous Record**: Lena’s previous record of well-documented and reproducible research does not entirely rule out the possibility of misconduct, but it does suggest that if she did engage in misconduct, it might have been a situational rather than a habitual action.\n\nGiven these factors, a moderate to high probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is warranted.\n\nProbability judgment: 65"
