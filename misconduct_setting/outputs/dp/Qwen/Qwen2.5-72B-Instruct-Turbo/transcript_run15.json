    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Switching software during a project and experiencing a hard drive failure are events that, while inconvenient, are not uncommon in a research setting. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how these events might have occurred without academic misconduct:\n\n1. **Software Switch**:\n   - **Justification**: Switching software can occur for several valid reasons. For example, if the new software offers better features, improved performance, or is more compatible with lab standards. It might also be due to licensing issues, changes in lab protocols, or the availability of new tools that were not present at the start of the project.\n   - **Likelihood**: Given the dynamic nature of research and the continuous updates in software, it is reasonably common for labs to switch software. Therefore, this could be a plausible and benign explanation.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **Justification**: Hard drive failures are a known risk in data storage. IT departments often have protocols in place to deal with such issues, including data backups. However, backups can fail, and not all files might be recoverable.\n   - **Likelihood**: While unfortunate, hard drive failures are relatively common in any environment that relies on digital storage. The IT department’s confirmation of the hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n3. **Combined Likelihood**:\n   - **Interdependence**: The two events (software switch and hard drive failure) are not necessarily related. The switch in software could have been planned and unrelated to the hard drive failure.\n   - **Context**: In a research environment, where multiple tasks and data management challenges are common, the combination of these events, though inconvenient, is still within the realm of possibility.\n\nGiven the context and the detailed explanations, the likelihood of these events occurring without academic misconduct is relatively high. However, it is not absolute certainty due to the complex nature of research and the potential for oversight or errors.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 75"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Switch**:\n   - **Justification**: While switching software can be a legitimate decision, it can also be used to obscure or manipulate data. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have used the switch to alter or cover up data. However, the switch itself does not necessarily indicate misconduct, and there are valid reasons for doing so. The timing and context of the switch would be crucial in assessing its legitimacy.\n   - **Likelihood**: If misconduct occurred, the lab might still have valid reasons to switch software, but it could also be seen as a convenient cover. The likelihood is moderate but not overwhelming.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **Justification**: A hard drive failure can be a real and unfortunate event, but it can also be used to explain missing or altered data. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have used the failure to remove evidence of her actions or to create plausible deniability.\n   - **Likelihood**: If misconduct occurred, the hard drive failure could be a strategic move to cover tracks. However, a confirmed hardware failure and the involvement of the IT department add credibility to the explanation, making it less likely to be a cover-up.\n\n3. **Combined Likelihood**:\n   - **Interdependence**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, these events could be seen as a series of actions to obscure or manipulate data. However, the confirmed hardware failure and the independent confirmation by the IT department make it less likely that these events were deliberately orchestrated.\n   - **Context**: The combination of these events could still occur coincidentally even if misconduct was present, but the likelihood is lower due to the potential for oversight and the need for multiple coinciding events.\n\nGiven the context and the detailed explanations, the likelihood of these events occurring if Lena engaged in academic misconduct is lower, but not impossible.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 30"

This is a natural part of the scientific method.\n   - **Documentation**: Keeping multiple versions of the analysis script, including earlier versions with more participants, is a best practice for transparency and reproducibility.\n\n3. **Ethical and Scientific Standards**:\n   - **Transparency**: Documenting the exclusion of participants in the final dataset is a key aspect of maintaining transparency and ensuring the validity of the results. This is consistent with ethical research practices.\n   - **Reproducibility**: Including all participants in early scripts and then excluding them in the final dataset can help other researchers understand the data cleaning process and replicate the study.\n\n4. **Lab Practices**:\n   - **Consistency with Peers**: If other students in the lab show similar patterns of initially including more participants and then excluding some, it suggests that this is a common and accepted practice in the lab.\n   - **Support and Guidance**: The lab’s emphasis on data integrity and reproducibility would support such practices, making it more likely that Lena would follow them.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that an earlier version of the analysis script including more participants would have certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is quite high.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 80"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Manipulating Results**:\n   - **Exclusion for Desired Outcomes**: If Lena was trying to manipulate the results, she might have included all participants in the initial script to make it appear as though she had a comprehensive dataset. Later, she could exclude certain participants to achieve the desired statistical significance or to fit her hypotheses.\n   - **Strategic Exclusions**: By excluding participants who do not support her desired outcomes, Lena could ensure that the final dataset produces the results she needs to support her claims.\n\n2. **Post-Hoc Adjustments**:\n   - **Adjustments to Fit Data**: After analyzing the data, Lena might have realized that certain participants were undermining her results. Excluding these participants in the final dataset would allow her to present a more favorable outcome.\n   - **Covering Tracks**: Including all participants in the initial script and then excluding them in the final dataset can make it appear as though the exclusions were part of a legitimate data cleaning process, rather than a post-hoc manipulation.\n\n3. **Rationalization**:\n   - **Justification**: Lena might rationalize the exclusions by claiming that the excluded participants did not meet the study’s criteria or were outliers. This can provide a plausible explanation for the changes.\n   - **Plausible Deniability**: By having an earlier script with more participants, Lena can create a narrative that she was thorough and meticulous in her data analysis, even if the exclusions were motivated by a desire to manipulate the results.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivation**:\n   - **High Stakes**: The pressure to produce publishable results, as indicated by her emails, can motivate Lena to take such steps. The importance of the study for her career and the grant review can make her more willing to engage in manipulative practices.\n   - **Career Impact**: The need to ensure the study “works” can lead her to make strategic exclusions to achieve her goals.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants would have certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is quite high.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 85"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is unlikely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomaly**:\n   - **Natural Distribution**: In a well-conducted study, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 if the null hypothesis is true. An unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 suggests a pattern that is not consistent with random chance.\n   - **Publication Bias**: While publication bias can lead to a higher proportion of significant results, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is particularly suspicious and often indicates potential manipulation or p-hacking.\n\n2. **Legitimate Reasons**:\n   - **Data Cleaning**: Legitimate data cleaning and exclusion of outliers can affect the distribution of p-values, but it is unlikely to create such a pronounced and specific pattern.\n   - **Multiple Comparisons**: Exploratory analyses often involve multiple comparisons, which can lead to some p-values being just below .05. However, a natural distribution would still show some p-values just above .05 as well.\n\n3. **Transparency and Reproducibility**:\n   - **Preregistration and Documentation**: If the study was conducted according to preregistered protocols and with transparent data handling, the distribution of p-values should reflect the true results of the analyses.\n   - **Replication**: If the study is well-documented and reproducible, other researchers should be able to replicate the results and observe a similar distribution of p-values, which would be less likely to show such a stark pattern.\n\n4. **Peer Review and Scrutiny**:\n   - **Review Process**: Peer reviewers and the scientific community are trained to detect such patterns. If the study was conducted without misconduct, the unusual distribution of p-values would be a red flag that would likely be caught during the review process.\n   - **Ethical Standards**: Researchers who adhere to ethical standards are unlikely to produce results that show such a pattern without a clear and justifiable explanation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is low.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 20"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Manipulation of Results**:\n   - **P-Hacking**: One common form of academic misconduct is p-hacking, which involves manipulating the data or analysis to achieve p-values just below the conventional threshold of .05. This can involve excluding certain participants, changing analysis methods, or running multiple analyses until significant results are obtained.\n   - **Selective Reporting**: Lena might selectively report or emphasize results with p-values just below .05 while downplaying or excluding those just above .05 to make the results appear more significant.\n\n2. **Strategic Exclusions**:\n   - **Excluding Outliers**: If Lena excluded participants or data points that would have resulted in p-values just above .05, she could create a dataset with a higher concentration of p-values just below .05. This can be done by selectively excluding participants who did not meet certain criteria or by manipulating the data in other ways.\n   - **Adjusting Analysis Parameters**: Changing the parameters of the analysis, such as exclusion criteria or statistical models, can also lead to p-values just below .05.\n\n3. **Rationalization and Justification**:\n   - **Plausible Exclusions**: Lena might rationalize the exclusions by claiming that the excluded participants were outliers or did not meet the study’s criteria. This can provide a plausible explanation for the unusual distribution of p-values.\n   - **Covering Tracks**: By creating a dataset with p-values just below .05, Lena can make it appear as though the results are significant and robust, which can help in getting the study published and meeting the high stakes of her situation.\n\n4. **High Stakes and Motivation**:\n   - **Career Impact**: The high stakes described in her emails, such as the need to secure the grant and improve her postdoc chances, provide a strong motivation for Lena to manipulate the results.\n   - **Pressure to Succeed**: The pressure to produce publishable findings can lead to unethical behavior, especially if Lena felt that a null result would have severe consequences for her career.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is quite high.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 85"

Here’s a summary of the key points that support this assessment:\n\n1. **Emails to a Friend**:\n   - Lena expressed significant pressure and high stakes, which can motivate misconduct.\n   \n2. **Preregistration Document Modification**:\n   - The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, which is highly suspicious and a red flag for potential manipulation.\n\n3. **Unusual P-Value Distribution**:\n   - The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, which is a strong indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Participants**:\n   - An earlier version of the analysis script included more participants, and some were later excluded. While this can be legitimate, it is more likely to be a sign of manipulation when combined with other evidence.\n\n5. **Data Irregularities**:\n   - The whistleblower’s concerns and the suspicious patterns in the dataset and analysis history suggest potential data manipulation.\n\n6. **Positive Past Record**:\n   - While Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit, the current evidence suggests a significant deviation from her past practices.\n\n7. **Lab Environment**:\n   - The lab’s emphasis on transparency and ethical standards makes the current irregularities more striking, as they stand out against the norm.\n\nGiven these points, the cumulative evidence strongly suggests that Lena may have engaged in academic misconduct to achieve the desired results under high pressure.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 75"
