The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Predating Notes:** If the notes predate the journal submission, it suggests that the decisions to exclude these participants were made before any pressure to produce significant results. This timing makes it less likely that the exclusions were part of a post-hoc attempt to manipulate the data.\n\n2. **Standard Practice:** Excluding participants who did not follow the task instructions or were not engaged (e.g., falling asleep) is a standard practice in research. Even if Lena was engaging in misconduct, it would be more unusual to do so in a way that leaves a clear and documented trail.\n\n3. **Motive and Opportunity:** If Lena was committing misconduct, she might be more careful to avoid obvious discrepancies. The presence of these notes could be seen as a risk, as they could be scrutinized during an inquiry. However, Lena might have believed that these exclusions were justified and would not raise suspicion.\n\n4. **Other Evidence:** The credibility of these notes would be evaluated in the context of other evidence. If other aspects of the data or analysis history are suspicious, it might cast doubt on these notes. However, the notes themselves, if they are genuine and detailed, can still provide strong support for the exclusions being legitimate.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is less likely that Lena would have left such clear and predating notes if she was committing misconduct, it is not entirely out of the question.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the lab switching statistical software packages halfway through the project and Lena’s laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, are plausible and relatively common occurrences in research settings. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Switch:** It is not uncommon for labs to switch statistical software packages for various reasons, such as the availability of new features, better support, or the personal preferences of the researchers. This can happen at any point during a project, especially if the initial software is found to be less suitable for the specific needs of the study.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure:** Hard drive failures are a well-known risk in the use of technology. It is not unusual for a researcher's laptop to experience a hardware failure, especially if the device is heavily used or has been in use for a significant period. The confirmation from the IT department that a hardware failure was reported and repaired adds credibility to this claim.\n\n3. **Impact on Data:** While a hard drive failure can lead to the loss of some files, it is also common for researchers to have backup systems in place, which can mitigate the impact. The loss of some files, particularly if they are not crucial to the main analysis, is a reasonable consequence of such an event.\n\nGiven these points, the combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure is not particularly unlikely and can be reasonably explained by routine research practices and the inherent risks of using technology.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the likelihood that the lab would switch software packages during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, is lower but still plausible. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Software Switch:** Switching software during a project can be a legitimate reason for various practical and methodological reasons. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might be more cautious about making changes that could be scrutinized. A software switch could be seen as a way to obscure or alter data, but it is not a common or particularly effective method of fraud.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure:** A confirmed hard drive failure is a genuine and common issue that can happen to any researcher. If Lena was committing misconduct, she might try to use the hard drive failure as a cover for missing or altered files. However, the IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure adds a layer of credibility to this claim. It would be more difficult to fabricate a hardware failure and have it confirmed by IT.\n\n3. **Missing Files:** If Lena was intentionally manipulating data, she might try to ensure that any evidence of tampering is not easily traceable. The loss of some files due to a hard drive failure could provide a convenient excuse for any gaps in the data. However, the fact that the hard drive failure is confirmed by IT and that the lab switched software independently reduces the likelihood that these events were part of a deliberate attempt to cover up misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is less likely that Lena would use these events to cover up misconduct, it is not impossible. The confirmed hard drive failure and the software switch are more likely to be coincidental and legitimate issues rather than part of a broader scheme of fraud.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

If the data management logs are thorough and transparent, it becomes more difficult to hide misconduct. The presence of multiple scripts can provide more data points for scrutiny, making it easier for investigators to identify inconsistencies or patterns of manipulation.\n\n3. **Lab-Wide Practice:** The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns suggests that this is a common and encouraged practice. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have felt pressure to conform to these practices to avoid standing out, but this would also mean that her actions are more likely to be compared against the norm, increasing the risk of detection.\n\n4. **Consistency and Credibility:** If Lena’s scripts and data management practices are consistent with those of her peers, it adds to the credibility of her work.

By including more participants in the initial script and then excluding specific participants in the final dataset, Lena could adjust the results to achieve statistical significance or other desired outcomes.\n\n2. **Post Hoc Exclusions:** If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might run initial analyses with a larger dataset to see the results and then exclude certain participants post hoc to make the results more favorable. This could involve excluding participants who had data that did not support the hypothesized findings.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks:** Post hoc exclusions can be a way to cover up misconduct by making the results appear more robust or planned. By documenting the exclusions in a way that seems justifiable, Lena could try to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Pressure to Produce Results:** Given the high stakes described in Lena’s emails, the pressure to produce significant results could lead her to engage in such manipulations. The need to meet the expectations of her supervisor and secure her career goals might motivate her to take unethical actions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants would have certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is relatively high.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"

Here’s a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **High Stakes and Pressure:** Lena’s emails indicate significant pressure to produce significant results, which can be a strong motivator for misconduct.\n\n2. **Preregistration Modifications:** The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a strong red flag for misconduct.\n\n3. **Unusual P-Value Distribution:** The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 suggests p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n4. **Selective Exclusions:** The presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants and the exclusion of certain participants in the final dataset could be a way to manipulate the results.\n\n5. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure:** While these events can be explained by routine issues, they can also be used to cover up misconduct, especially if combined with other suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Strong Record and Lab Practices:** Lena’s previous strong record of careful data handling and the lab’s commitment to transparency and robustness make the current allegations more concerning, as they suggest a significant departure from her usual practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there are some mundane explanations for some of the issues, the combination of multiple red flags strongly suggests the possibility of academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
