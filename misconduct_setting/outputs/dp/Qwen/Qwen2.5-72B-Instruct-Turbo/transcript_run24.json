    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Switching statistical software in the middle of a project is not an uncommon occurrence, especially if there are improvements or new features in the new software that could benefit the study. However, it can introduce complexities, such as differences in data formatting, analysis methods, and file compatibility, which could lead to some irregularities in the data or analysis.\n\nA hard drive failure is also a relatively common issue, particularly in a research environment where data is often stored on multiple devices. The fact that the IT department confirms the hardware failure adds credibility to Lena's claim that files were lost due to this event. Losing files can indeed lead to gaps in data and analysis records, which might appear suspicious but are not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\nGiven these points, it is not highly unlikely that both the software switch and the hard drive failure could occur without any intention of misconduct. However, the combination of these events does raise some questions that need to be carefully addressed in the inquiry.\n\nConsidering all the information provided, the probability that the lab would switch software and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, without any intention of academic misconduct, is around 60.\n\n60"

However, it's still possible that these events happened coincidentally or were used to create an alibi.\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software could be a way to obscure the methods used to manipulate data, but it's not a common strategy for misconduct. More often, misconduct involves altering data within the same software to avoid detection. The switch could have been for legitimate reasons unrelated to misconduct, such as new features or improved functionality.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure is a plausible event that could lead to the loss of files, which might be used to cover up fabricated or falsified data. However, a hard drive failure is a relatively common technical issue and can happen independently of any intent to hide misconduct.\n\nGiven that the IT department confirms the hard drive failure, it is more likely that this was a genuine hardware issue. The software switch, while potentially convenient for someone trying to cover up misconduct, is more likely to be a legitimate decision made by the lab for other reasons.\n\nConsidering all these factors, if Lena did engage in academic misconduct, the probability that the lab would switch software and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, is around 30.\n\n30"

Falling asleep or not understanding the instructions are valid reasons for exclusion because they can severely impact the quality and validity of the data.\n\n2. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that the notes predate the journal submission and are in the raw data files suggests a systematic approach to data management. This aligns with good research practices, where exclusion criteria are documented in real-time as the data is collected and analyzed.\n\n3. **Consistency with Ethical Standards**: Excluding participants for valid reasons and documenting these exclusions in a transparent manner is consistent with ethical and methodological standards in scientific research. It helps maintain the integrity of the study and ensures that the results are reliable and interpretable.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena did not engage in academic misconduct, it is quite likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n\n85"

Pre-existing notes that are consistent and well-documented provide a strong alibi and can be difficult to fabricate convincingly, especially when there are multiple points of verification.\n\n2. **Consistency with Data**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons like falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a standard practice, but if the notes were created as a cover-up, they would need to be consistent with the data and the timeline. Any discrepancies could be detected during an investigation.\n\n3. **Risks of Detection**: Fabricating or altering data in a way that leaves a trail of pre-existing notes increases the risk of detection. If the notes were created after the fact, they might not align perfectly with the rest of the data and could be identified as a forgery.\n\nHowever, it is not impossible that Lena could have created these notes to cover up her actions. The presence of these notes could still be a strategy to obscure misconduct, but it would be a risky and complex one.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission is around 40.\n\n40"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is a complex judgment that involves weighing multiple factors. Here’s a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Preregistration Document Modification**: The fact that the preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a strong indicator of potential misconduct. This practice undermines the integrity of the research and is often associated with p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2. **P-value Distribution**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a red flag. This pattern is often a sign of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation.\n\n3. **Emails to a Friend**: Lena's emails expressing the high stakes and her personal need for the study to succeed provide a strong motivation for misconduct. While feeling pressure is common, it can drive individuals to take unethical actions.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Participants**: The presence of additional participants in an earlier analysis script and their exclusion in the final dataset could be a sign of selective data manipulation. However, this practice can also be legitimate if the exclusions are based on valid criteria.\n\n5. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab switching software and Lena’s hard drive failure are plausible events that can happen without misconduct. However, they can also be used to cover up irregularities.\n\n6. **Previous Record**: Lena’s previous record of well-documented and reproducible research suggests a history of ethical practices. However, a single instance of misconduct does not necessarily contradict this record.\n\n7. **Lab Practices**: The lab’s encouragement of running multiple alternative analyses and exploring robustness is a positive practice. However, it can also be used to obscure misconduct if the criteria for exclusions are manipulated.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, the evidence points toward a significant likelihood of academic misconduct, but it is not absolutely certain. The probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, considering all the evidence, is around 70.\n\n70"
