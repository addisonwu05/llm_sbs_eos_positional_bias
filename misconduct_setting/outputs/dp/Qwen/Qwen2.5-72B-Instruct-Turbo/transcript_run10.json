The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a standard practice in research, especially in cognitive neuroscience, where the quality of data can significantly impact the validity of the results. If Lena is operating under standard procedures, it is highly likely that such exclusions would be made and documented before the data analysis and paper submission.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Standard Practice**: It is common for researchers to exclude participants who do not follow instructions or are not paying attention. This is often done to ensure the reliability and validity of the data. Such exclusions are typically documented in the raw data files to maintain transparency and traceability.\n\n2. **Documentation**: The fact that notes in the raw data files predate the journal submission suggests that these exclusions were not made post-hoc in response to reviewer comments or to manipulate the results. Pre-existing notes indicate that these decisions were made during the data cleaning process, which is a routine part of data preparation.\n\n3. **Transparency**: If Lena has a strong record of careful data handling, it is more likely that she followed standard procedures. The presence of pre-dating notes supports the idea that these exclusions were part of the initial data processing, which would be expected in a well-managed lab.\n\n4. **Mundane Explanations**: The lab's recent switch in software could have affected how data was recorded and managed, but it does not necessarily imply intentional misconduct. Similarly, the hard drive failure could explain the missing files without suggesting fraud.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is **85**.\n\n85"

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Forethought and Planning**: If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she would likely have to plan her actions carefully to avoid detection. Pre-dating notes to exclude participants would be a risky move because it could be traced back and investigated.\n\n2. **Consistency**: Adding notes that predate the journal submission to justify exclusions after the fact would require maintaining a consistent and believable narrative. This is more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of inconsistencies being discovered.\n\n3. **Detection Risk**: Pre-dated notes could be scrutinized during an internal inquiry, and any discrepancies or irregularities could be more easily identified. If Lena was trying to cover up misconduct, she might avoid leaving such clear and traceable evidence.\n\n4. **Standard Practice**: Excluding participants based on these criteria is a standard practice, but if Lena was fabricating or falsifying data, she might have been more cautious about leaving a paper trail.

This can happen at any point during a project, particularly if the existing software is becoming outdated or if the lab wants to standardize its tools.\n\n2. **Hardware Failures**: Laptop hard drive failures are a known and relatively common issue. IT departments regularly deal with such problems, and a confirmed hardware failure is a plausible and mundane explanation for missing files. This type of failure can occur at any time and is not indicative of intentional misconduct.\n\n3. **Impact on Files**: Hard drive failures can indeed result in the loss of some files, which can be a significant setback in a research project. However, it is a known risk that researchers and IT departments are aware of, and steps are often taken to mitigate this risk (e.g., regular backups).\n\n4. **Circumstantial Evidence**: The fact that the IT department confirms the hardware failure and repair adds credibility to this explanation. It provides an independent and verifiable account of the event.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is **70**.\n\n70"

If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have been more cautious about introducing changes that could be scrutinized or create additional opportunities for errors.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a plausible and common event, but if Lena was fabricating or falsifying data, she might have tried to avoid creating situations that could lead to the loss of files. Fabricating data often requires maintaining a consistent and traceable record to avoid detection, and a hard drive failure could complicate this.\n\n3. **Convenience of Explanation**: If Lena was committing misconduct, she might have been more likely to fabricate a simpler and less traceable explanation for missing files. A hard drive failure could raise more questions and increase the risk of detection, especially if the missing files are crucial to the validity of the data.\n\n4. **IT Department Confirmation**: The fact that the IT department confirms the hardware failure and repair adds an external layer of verification to this event.

These emails align with a mindset where the ends justify the means.\n\n4. **Confiding in a Friend**: Researchers who are considering or engaging in misconduct might confide in trusted friends or colleagues about the pressures they are facing. This can be a way to rationalize their actions or seek understanding.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena would write such emails, if she did commit academic misconduct, is **80**.\n\n80"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by considering the cumulative weight of the various pieces of information. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Data Irregularities and P-values**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of potential data manipulation. This is a known red flag for academic misconduct.\n\n2. **Preregistration Document**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant concern. This suggests post-hoc adjustments to achieve desired results.\n\n3. **Emails**: Lena's emails expressing the high stakes and her personal need for the study to succeed provide a strong motivational context for misconduct. While pressure alone does not prove misconduct, it can be a contributing factor.\n\n4. **Previous Conduct**: Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling, and her earlier projects passed independent audits. This suggests that if she did engage in misconduct, it might be a recent deviation from her usual practices.\n\n5. **Lab Practices**: The lab's practices, such as running multiple alternative analysis scripts and the lab-wide push for robustness, are generally positive. However, the presence of these practices does not preclude the possibility of misconduct, especially if Lena felt significant pressure.\n\n6. **Technical Issues**: The lab's switch to new software and the hard drive failure are plausible and common events that do not necessarily indicate misconduct. However, they can complicate the investigation and provide potential cover for manipulation.\n\n7. **Participant Exclusions**: The exclusion of participants based on notes that predate the journal submission is less likely to be indicative of misconduct, but the presence of an earlier script with additional participants raises some concerns.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is:\n\n**60**\n\n60"
