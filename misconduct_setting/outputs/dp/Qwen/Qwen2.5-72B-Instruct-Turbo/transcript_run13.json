The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This practice is often part of a scientific approach to ensure the robustness and reliability of results, especially in a lab that emphasizes such practices. Multiple alternative analyses can help researchers understand how sensitive their findings are to different methodological choices and can provide a more comprehensive picture of the data.\n\nGiven that other students in the lab also show similar patterns in their scripts, it suggests that this is a common and accepted practice within the lab. This further supports the likelihood that Lena was following standard procedures rather than engaging in misconduct.\n\nHowever, the presence of multiple alternative scripts does not entirely rule out the possibility of misconduct. It could still be used to selectively report only the results that support the desired outcome. Nevertheless, the fact that this is a common practice in the lab and that Lena has a strong record of careful data handling increases the likelihood that her actions were legitimate.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the lab’s data management logs would show Lena running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, if she did not commit academic misconduct, is around 85.\n\n85"

This practice could be used to find the analysis that yields the most favorable results, while still appearing to be conducting a robust and comprehensive study.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while running multiple analyses can be a red flag when combined with other suspicious activities, it is not conclusive evidence of misconduct on its own.
