The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Common Practice vs. Misconduct**: Running multiple analyses is a common practice in scientific research to ensure robustness. If Lena committed misconduct, she might have tried to obscure her actions by mimicking these common practices. However, this would be more difficult and riskier, as it could lead to inconsistencies that might be detected during an inquiry.\n\n2. **Mundane Explanations**: The lab's routine of running multiple analyses provides a plausible cover for misconduct. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might not have the same meticulous record-keeping as her colleagues, which could lead to discrepancies that stand out during the inquiry.\n\n3. **Consistency with Lab Culture**: If other students in the lab are also running multiple analyses, it suggests a strong lab culture of thoroughness. If Lena was fabricating or falsifying data, she might not have followed this culture as closely, potentially leading to differences in her data management patterns.\n\n4. **Risk of Detection**: Intentional manipulation or fabrication of data is more likely to involve fewer, more controlled analysis scripts to minimize the risk of detection. Running and storing multiple scripts with different exclusion criteria might increase the risk of being caught, as it could introduce more variables for investigators to scrutinize.\n\nGiven these factors, while it is still possible that Lena's logs might show multiple alternative analysis scripts if she committed misconduct, it is less likely compared to the scenario where she did not commit misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"

If Lena's earlier projects were well-documented and reproducible, it suggests that she has established and follows good research practices.\n\n2. **Independent Verification**: An independent data audit that rated her previous projects as well-documented and reproducible provides objective evidence of her reliable research methods. Such an audit would typically involve a detailed examination of her data, scripts, and documentation, which is a strong validation of her practices.\n\n3. **Lab Culture and Training**: Working in a lab that emphasizes robust data management and reproducibility likely reinforces these practices. If the lab has a culture of thoroughness and regular audits, Lena would be more likely to adhere to these standards consistently.\n\n4. **Reputation and Incentives**: Researchers with a strong reputation for producing reliable and reproducible results are often motivated to maintain this reputation.

However, if Lena was engaged in misconduct, she might have found it more challenging to manage multiple software environments and ensure consistency in her fraudulent activities. This could make the switch less likely or more problematic if it did occur.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: While hard drive failures are common and can happen at any time, they can also be used as a convenient excuse to cover up data manipulation. If Lena was engaged in misconduct, she might have attempted to use the hard drive failure to explain the loss of incriminating files. However, the IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure provides a verifiable explanation, which makes this scenario more plausible but still less likely in the context of misconduct.\n\n3. **Impact on Data**: If Lena was engaging in misconduct, the loss of files could be more strategically managed to cover up her actions.

Lena's candidness in these emails can be a sign of her genuine concerns and the pressure she feels, rather than an indication of misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is reasonably likely that she would write emails expressing these pressures and concerns.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that she would write emails expressing that her supervisor was counting on this study, that a null result would hurt her postdoc chances, and that she \"needs this one to work.\" Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Pressure and Motivation**: The high pressure from her supervisor and the significant impact on her career prospects can create a strong motivation to engage in misconduct. Lena might feel that the success of the study is crucial for her future, which could push her to manipulate the data.\n\n2. **Justification of Actions**: Researchers who engage in misconduct often rationalize their actions by emphasizing the external pressures they face. Expressing these pressures in private communications can be a way to justify their behavior to themselves and to others.\n\n3. **Emotional Investment**: The emotional investment in the study and the fear of a null result can lead to a stronger likelihood of misconduct. Lena's statements in the emails reflect her personal investment and the stakes she feels are involved, which can align with the decision to manipulate data.\n\n4. **Confiding in a Friend**: Private communications with a friend can be a way to vent and share genuine concerns. If Lena was feeling the pressure and considering misconduct, she might confide in a friend about the situation, knowing it is a safe space to express these thoughts.\n\n5. **Red Flags**: The statements in the emails are consistent with the psychological and situational factors that can lead to academic misconduct. Researchers who feel desperate or under intense pressure are more likely to engage in unethical behavior to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\nGiven these factors, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that she would write emails expressing these pressures and concerns.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is relatively high. Here are the key pieces of evidence and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusually Concentrated P-values**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern is statistically anomalous and raises significant suspicion.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious red flag. This suggests a lack of transparency and a potential attempt to align the results with desired outcomes.\n\n3. **Emails to a Friend**: The emails expressing pressure from her supervisor, the impact on her postdoc chances, and her strong need for the study to work provide context for the high pressure and motivation to engage in misconduct. While not definitive, these statements align with the psychological and situational factors that can lead to academic misconduct.\n\n4. **Participant Exclusions**: The earlier analysis script including more participants and the later exclusions, while not uncommon, can be a red flag if the exclusions appear to be selectively made to achieve significant results.\n\n5. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: While these events can be explained by normal operational issues, they add complexity to the situation and can be used as excuses to cover up data manipulation. However, the IT department's confirmation of the hard drive failure provides a plausible explanation.\n\n6. **Previous Record**: Lena's previous record of careful data handling and positive audits provides a counterbalance to the suspicious evidence. While it suggests she has been diligent in the past, it does not rule out the possibility of misconduct in this specific instance.\n\n7. **Lab Culture**: The lab's emphasis on robust data management and transparency suggests that misconduct would be less likely, but it does not eliminate the possibility, especially under high pressure.\n\nGiven these factors, the evidence strongly suggests a higher likelihood of academic misconduct, although it is not definitive. The combination of the statistical anomalies, the modification of the preregistration document, and the high pressure expressed in the emails collectively point to a significant risk of misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
