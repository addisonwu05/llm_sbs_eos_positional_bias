The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did engage in academic misconduct, the likelihood of the lab switching software and her laptop suffering a confirmed hard drive failure would be influenced by several factors:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: If Lena was fabricating or falsifying data, she might have a strong incentive to ensure that any irregularities or inconsistencies are difficult to trace. Switching software could provide an opportunity to manipulate data in a way that is less detectable, especially if the new software has different default settings or file formats. However, this switch itself is not necessarily a strong indicator of misconduct, as it could have been a legitimate decision by the lab for other reasons.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A hard drive failure is a random event that can happen to anyone and is not inherently linked to misconduct. However, if Lena was engaged in misconduct, the loss of files due to a hard drive failure could provide a convenient cover for any altered or fabricated data. The timing of the hard drive failure (around the same time as the software switch) might raise suspicions, but it does not definitively prove misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that these events (software switch and hard drive failure) would occur if Lena did engage in academic misconduct is somewhat higher than in the scenario where she did not, but it is still not a guarantee. The hard drive failure, in particular, remains a random event that could occur regardless of her intentions.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the lab would switch software and Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure if she did engage in academic misconduct is around 40.\n\n40"

It helps researchers understand the robustness of their findings and ensures that the results are not artifacts of specific data processing choices.\n\n2. **Lab-Wide Initiative**: The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts suggests that this is a lab-wide practice.

This pattern can be a red flag for potential p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation, even if unintentional.\n\n2. **Random Distribution**: In a well-conducted study, p-values should be randomly distributed around the significance threshold of .05.

This can involve changing exclusion criteria to exclude certain participants or altering primary outcomes to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Covering Tracks**: Altering the preregistration can help conceal the manipulation of data. By making it appear that the changes were part of the original plan, Lena could try to avoid detection and maintain the appearance of a well-conducted study.\n\n3. **Pressure to Succeed**: Given the high stakes described in her emails, Lena might have felt a strong pressure to ensure the study produced significant results. Modifying the preregistration is a way to achieve this, even if it involves unethical practices.\n\n4. **Rationalization**: Researchers engaged in misconduct often rationalize their actions by focusing on the perceived necessity of the results. Lena might have justified the modifications as necessary to save the grant and secure her career prospects.\n\n5. **Previous Patterns**: If Lena was already engaged in other forms of misconduct, such as p-hacking or data fabrication, modifying the preregistration would be a logical extension of these practices.\n\nGiven these points, the probability that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is very high.\n\n85"

Here are the key points that support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**: This is a significant red flag and suggests potential p-hacking or data manipulation to achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: Changing the preregistration document after data collection to alter exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research integrity and strongly indicates misconduct.\n\n3. **Emails Indicating High Pressure**: The emails to her friend show that Lena was under significant pressure to produce positive results, which can be a strong motivator for misconduct.\n\n4. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: While running multiple scripts is common, in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be seen as an attempt to manipulate results.\n\n5. **Data Management Irregularities**: The lab’s data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts and the hard drive failure, while not definitive proof, raise additional concerns.\n\n6. **Previous Good Record**: While Lena has a previous record of well-documented and reproducible research, this does not rule out the possibility of misconduct, especially under high pressure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 75.\n\n75"
