The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is intended to establish analytical plans *before* data is collected and analyzed, thereby guarding against \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) and p-hacking, which are forms of questionable research practices often considered academic misconduct.\n\nIf Lena genuinely did not commit academic misconduct (i.e., she had no intention to manipulate, fabricate data, or engage in deceptive reporting such as HARKing), for this situation to occur, it would require a highly improbable confluence of circumstances:\n\n1.  **Profound misunderstanding of preregistration ethics:** Lena would have to genuinely believe it is acceptable to modify the *original* preregistration document post-data collection, rather than creating a transparent, dated amendment or addendum to document any necessary changes and their justification. This level of misunderstanding would be unusual for a third-year PhD student in a lab that utilizes preregistration.\n2.  **Genuine and significant error in initial preregistration OR legitimate, unforeseen data issues:** The original preregistration document would need to contain such substantial errors in defining primary outcomes or exclusion criteria that a correction was genuinely necessary. Alternatively, Lena would have discovered unforeseen, legitimate issues with the data *after collection but before any main analyses that would reveal favorable results*, necessitating changes to these core aspects of the study.\n3.  **Poor procedural practice:** Even if a genuine reason for change existed, an honest researcher would document the *deviation* from the original preregistration via a transparent, dated amendment, clearly explaining the rationale. Covertly altering the *original document* implies an intent to make it appear as if the changes were part of the original plan, which is inherently misleading.\n\nThe specific actions mentioned—modifying the *original preregistration document* after data collection to change *exclusion criteria and primary outcomes*—are hallmarks of attempting to retroactively align the research plan with observed results. This is precisely what preregistration aims to prevent. Even if Lena did not fabricate data, this action strongly suggests a form of academic misconduct related to deceptive reporting or HARKing.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that this action would occur *without* Lena committing academic misconduct (i.e., without an intent to mislead or manipulate the interpretation of results) is exceedingly low. It would require an exceptional degree of ethical ignorance, procedural error, and unfortunate circumstance to explain such a critical deviation from best practices in a manner consistent with \"no misconduct.\"\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

Changing exclusion criteria could remove data points that weaken the effect, and changing primary outcomes could allow her to declare a *post-hoc* significant finding as if it were a pre-registered primary hypothesis. Modifying the original document retroactively masks this \"fishing for significance.\"\n2.  **Creating a \"clean\" narrative:** The report mentions that the paper \"reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory... and several secondary analyses also yield 'clean' results.\" If these results were achieved through selective analysis or by re-evaluating the data until a desired outcome was found, retroactively altering the preregistration would make these analytical choices appear legitimate and pre-planned, rather than driven by the data itself.\n3.  **Responding to reviewer comments:** The inquiry noted that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments.\" If Lena had initially submitted results that were borderline or not significant and then, under pressure or with intent to deceive, re-analyzed data in a way that produced stronger results (e.g., by changing exclusion criteria), modifying the preregistration document would serve to legitimize these *post-hoc* changes.\n4.  **Covering Intentional Manipulation:** If Lena had, for example, fabricated or selectively included data, adjusting the preregistration to align with the \"perfect\" results would be a way to add a layer of perceived legitimacy to her fraudulent findings.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document in this specific way is not merely a possibility but a highly probable tactic. It directly facilitates the presentation of misleading or manipulated results as legitimate and pre-planned, thereby achieving the goals of misconduct (e.g., publication, grant success).\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

This phenomenon suggests that analyses were either:\n1.  Tweaked or re-run multiple times with slight variations (e.g., different exclusion criteria, covariates, statistical models) until a result just crossed the arbitrary .05 significance threshold.\n2.  Many analyses were performed, but only those that yielded a p-value below .05 (especially those close to the threshold) were reported or highlighted, while those just above .05 were discarded or downplayed.\n\nIf Lena genuinely did *not* commit academic misconduct, it implies that all her analytical choices and reporting were honest, unbiased, and followed ethical research practices. In such a scenario:\n\n*   **Expected P-value Distribution:** For a series of truly independent exploratory analyses, if there are genuine effects, p-values would generally be distributed across a range. Some might be very significant (e.g., p < .001), some moderately significant (e.g., p = .01-.03), some just below .05, some just above .05, and many non-significant (p > .05). While some p-values might naturally fall just below .05 by chance, it is extremely improbable for *several* analyses to consistently cluster *just below* .05 while almost entirely lacking p-values *just above* .05.\n*   **Statistical Implausibility:** The threshold of p=.05 is arbitrary. If analyses were conducted genuinely, there's no inherent reason for true effects to \"know\" this threshold and consistently fall only on one side of it, especially given the continuous nature of p-values. The sudden drop-off of p-values immediately above .05 is highly suspicious and statistically unlikely to occur by chance alone under conditions of unbiased analysis and complete reporting.\n\nTherefore, for this specific pattern to emerge without Lena committing academic misconduct (which would include p-hacking or selective reporting as forms of misconduct), it would require an extremely rare and statistically improbable coincidence. It would mean that every single true effect investigated in those exploratory analyses happened to produce a p-value just below .05, with none happening to fall just above the threshold, purely by chance. This defies the principles of statistical distributions under honest inquiry.\n\nProbability judgment: 5"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, the described pattern of p-values is a highly probable outcome, as it is a hallmark signature of several forms of such misconduct.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1.  **P-hacking/Selective Reporting:** When a researcher engages in p-hacking (running multiple analyses, tweaking variables, or modifying exclusion criteria until a statistically significant result is obtained) or selective reporting (only presenting analyses that yield significant results while omitting others), the distribution of p-values often shows exactly this type of clustering. The goal is to cross the arbitrary p < .05 threshold. If an analysis initially yields p=.06, a p-hacker might make small adjustments to get it to p=.049. If many exploratory analyses are conducted, only those that achieve significance, especially borderline ones, are highlighted, leading to an excess just below .05 and a dearth just above.\n2.  **Pressure to Publish:** The case states Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings.\" This environment can incentivize researchers to engage in practices that ensure results meet publication criteria, such as statistical significance. Academic misconduct, in this context, would involve deliberately manipulating the analysis process to achieve these desired significant results.\n3.  **\"Clean\" Results:** The paper reports \"strong, statistically significant support... and several secondary analyses also yield 'clean' results.\" This often means findings that are clear-cut and fit the expected narrative. An intentional decision to only report significant findings or to nudge non-significant results into significance would naturally lead to this pattern.\n4.  **Covering Up Lack of Effect:** If the true underlying effect is weak or non-existent, and a researcher is determined to find a significant result, p-hacking is a common method. This will almost inevitably lead to a cluster of p-values just below the conventional significance threshold, as these are the \"easiest\" to obtain through minor, often unjustified, analytical adjustments.\n\nTherefore, if Lena intended to mislead or manipulate the data to produce publishable, significant results, orchestrating this specific p-value distribution would be a very direct and expected consequence of those actions.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

This is a standard part of the data cleaning and quality control process in scientific research.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there are numerous legitimate reasons why an earlier analysis script might include participants who were later excluded from the final dataset:\n\n1.  **Data Quality Issues:** Participants might have failed to follow instructions, responded randomly, fallen asleep, or exhibited technical issues during data collection (e.g., equipment malfunction, corrupted files). These issues are often identified during initial data cleaning and quality checks, leading to exclusion.\n2.  **Outlier Detection:** Some participants' data might be extreme outliers, distorting group-level statistics. While the criteria for outlier exclusion should ideally be pre-registered, identifying and legitimately excluding outliers is a common practice in data analysis, even if the specific criteria are refined during the analysis process.\n3.  **Incomplete Data:** Some participants might have incomplete data for specific measures or tasks, making them unsuitable for certain analyses.\n4.  **Protocol Violations:** It might be discovered after data collection that a participant did not meet the study's inclusion criteria or violated other aspects of the research protocol.\n5.  **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** As a researcher delves deeper into the data, they might refine their understanding of appropriate exclusion criteria. An initial script might process all available data, and subsequent iterations incorporate more rigorous or refined exclusion rules based on data distributions or more detailed quality checks.\n6.  **Software Changes:** The case mentions the lab recently switched software. This could lead to data inconsistencies or issues for certain participants during conversion or processing, necessitating their exclusion.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants simply reflects the iterative nature of data processing. Researchers typically start with all collected data, and then apply a series of cleaning, quality control, and exclusion steps before arriving at the final dataset used for primary analyses. If Lena's reasons for exclusion were legitimate and not driven by a desire to manipulate results (which is the premise when assuming \"no academic misconduct\"), then this scenario is not only plausible but highly probable.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This is a common tactic used in several forms of academic misconduct, particularly p-hacking or data manipulation aimed at achieving desired results.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **P-hacking through Data Exclusion:** One of the most straightforward ways to p-hack is to selectively exclude participants whose data do not support the desired hypothesis or weaken the statistical significance of the results. If initial analyses (reflected in an earlier script) did not yield significant findings, or if the results were not \"clean\" enough, Lena might have deliberately removed participants whose data points pushed p-values above .05, reduced effect sizes, or introduced unwanted variability.\n2.  **Achieving \"Perfect\" or \"Clean\" Results:** The case mentions the final paper reports \"strong, statistically significant support\" and \"clean\" results. If Lena was intentionally manipulating data, removing \"uncooperative\" participants would be a direct way to achieve this desired level of clarity and significance.\n3.  **Responding to Pressure:** Given Professor Mills's pressure for publishable findings, Lena, if committing misconduct, would be motivated to ensure the data aligns with the theory. Eliminating data points that contradict the theory or weaken its support would be a logical step in this direction.\n4.  **Covering Intentional Fabrication/Falsification:** Even if some data were fabricated, Lena might still need to remove real participants whose data would expose the inconsistency or reduce the impact of the fabricated results.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants simply provides a baseline, showing that more data was initially considered. The *change* between that earlier script and the final dataset – specifically, the *exclusion* of certain participants – becomes a suspicious red flag if misconduct is occurring. In essence, an earlier, more inclusive dataset provides the \"raw material\" from which a researcher intent on misconduct can selectively prune to achieve favorable outcomes.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This is a common pressure point for labs, and students are often aware of it. Professor Mills being \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review\" is a real-world scenario, and Lena recognizing this fact is entirely normal.\n    *   **Career Progression:** Publications, especially \"strong, statistically significant support\" in \"top journals,\" are critical for securing post-doctoral positions and academic careers. A \"null result\" (meaning the theory wasn't supported, or the effect wasn't found) can indeed make it harder to publish in prestigious journals and, consequently, hinder a student's career prospects. Lena's concern about her postdoc chances is a genuine and widely felt anxiety among PhD students.\n    *   **Desire for Success:** Any researcher, honest or otherwise, wants their experiments to \"work\" in the sense that they want to find meaningful results, support their hypotheses, and contribute new knowledge. This desire is a fundamental driver of scientific inquiry.\n\n2.  **Private Communication:** These are emails to a friend, not official communications. People often express their deepest anxieties, hopes, and the pressures they face more candidly in private conversations or informal writings. This provides an outlet for stress and allows them to articulate the intensity of their situation.\n\n3.  **Motivation vs. Action:** Feeling intense pressure and strongly desiring a particular outcome (\"I need this one to work\") does not automatically equate to committing misconduct. Many honest researchers feel these same pressures and desires but maintain their integrity. The emails reflect Lena's *motivation* and the *environment* she's in, which are critical contextual factors, but they do not, by themselves, prove that she acted unethically. They show the emotional and professional stakes involved.\n\nGiven these points, an honest, hardworking, and ambitious PhD student facing significant career and lab pressures would very plausibly express exactly these kinds of worries and hopes to a trusted friend.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

If she resorted to unethical practices, these emails clearly articulate the severe pressure and high stakes that would have pushed her in that direction.\n2.  **Emotional Outlet:** Even someone engaging in misconduct is under immense stress and likely needs an outlet to vent about the pressures they are facing. Private emails to a friend are a natural place to express these anxieties, hopes, and the perceived necessity of a positive outcome. These emails reveal her state of mind and the context of her actions.\n3.  **Justification/Rationalization (Internal):** While not a public statement, expressing \"I need this one to work\" could also serve as an internal rationalization for any unethical choices she might have made or be contemplating. The perceived necessity of success due to external pressures can make misconduct seem like the only option.\n4.  **Consistency with Action:** If Lena *did* commit misconduct to ensure the study \"worked,\" then her prior statements expressing that intense need for it to work are perfectly consistent with her actions.

Researchers, even those with strong ethical foundations, can succumb to immense pressure and make unethical choices at a specific, high-stakes point in their career. The case explicitly details the extreme pressure Lena was under for *this specific study* (\"counting on this study to save the grant,\" \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"). This suggests that the current situation might represent an isolated lapse driven by exceptional circumstances, rather than a long-standing pattern of dishonest behavior.\n2.  **Learning and Sophistication of Misconduct:** If Lena's prior work genuinely passed a rigorous independent audit and was rated highly for documentation and reproducibility, it strongly implies that she was either not engaging in misconduct at that time, or any potential misconduct was undetectable. It's possible she developed more sophisticated methods of manipulation, or simply yielded to pressure for the first time, only in the current study.\n3.  **Strategic Behavior (Less Likely but Possible):** While less common, a researcher *could* maintain a spotless record on earlier, lower-stakes projects to build credibility, only to engage in misconduct on a critical project.

A switch \"halfway through the project\" is inconvenient but not unheard of, especially for long-running projects or if a compelling reason arises.

If Lena is an ethical researcher, she would be expected to follow and contribute to such a positive lab culture.\n3.  **Transparency and Documentation:** Storing these multiple scripts, even the alternative ones, in the data management logs reflects good data management practices. It shows transparency about the analytical process, allowing others (including auditors or future researchers) to see all the steps considered, not just the final chosen path. This is antithetical to hiding information for misconduct.\n4.  **Normal Variation in Data Processing:** Honest researchers often iterate through different methods to find the most appropriate way to analyze their data. Exclusion criteria can be particularly complex, as they often involve judgment calls about data quality, outliers, or participant compliance. Exploring how results change with stricter or looser criteria is a legitimate way to understand the boundaries of a finding.\n\nIn summary, this behavior is a hallmark of diligent, transparent, and rigorous scientific work, particularly when it's part of a shared lab culture focused on robustness. It indicates a commitment to thoroughly understanding the data, rather than trying to force a specific outcome.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

Running multiple analyses with varying exclusion criteria is a common method for p-hacking (i.e., running analyses until a desired significant result is achieved). If this practice is normalized and even encouraged as \"robustness checks\" within the lab, Lena can legitimately claim that her numerous scripts were part of the standard lab protocol, even if her underlying *intent* was to find and select the most favorable outcome.\n2.  **The Nature of P-hacking:** P-hacking often involves running many variations of analyses, including slight adjustments to exclusion criteria, covariates, or statistical models, until a p-value crosses a significance threshold. Storing these various scripts, even if some were used for unethical searching, is simply a record of the steps taken.\n3.  **Appearing Compliant with Lab Policy:** Even a researcher committing misconduct would generally try to appear compliant with lab policies and best practices, especially if those practices align with actions that can be manipulated for misconduct. By following the lab's \"robustness\" approach, Lena would be creating a paper trail that looks legitimate on the surface.\n\nTherefore, the lab's procedures would provide a convenient and plausible justification for the very actions that could be used for academic misconduct, making it highly probable that such logs would exist even if Lena were acting unethically.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

Such participants' data would not reflect the intended experimental conditions or cognitive processes, thus compromising the validity of the study.\n2.  **Standard Data Quality Control:** Excluding such participants is a standard and essential practice in data cleaning and quality control. Researchers are expected to identify and remove data from participants who did not properly engage with the task or follow instructions.\n3.  **Good Documentation Practice:** Making notes in the raw data files about the reasons for exclusion is excellent data management and transparency. It creates an audit trail for all data decisions, which is a hallmark of good scientific practice.\n4.  **Timeliness of Exclusion:** The fact that these notes *predate any journal submission* is particularly important. It indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made as part of the initial data processing and quality control, *before* the results were fully known or before external pressures related to publication could have influenced the decision. This strongly supports the legitimacy and ethical nature of the exclusion.\n\nIn summary, this scenario describes Lena engaging in responsible, ethical, and diligent data handling that is expected of any competent researcher. These actions demonstrate a commitment to data quality and transparency, fully consistent with someone who is *not* committing academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 98"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still highly likely that these specific events would occur.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Basic Data Quality Control is Universal:** Even a researcher engaging in misconduct would still typically perform fundamental data quality checks. Data from participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions is genuinely \"bad data\" that would likely obscure or weaken any desired effects, whether those effects are real or a result of manipulation. Removing such obviously invalid data is a standard practice that would benefit *any* analysis, legitimate or otherwise.\n2.  **Maintaining a Facade of Legitimacy:** A researcher committing misconduct would generally strive to make their overall research process appear legitimate. Properly documenting obvious exclusions, especially with notes that predate journal submission, helps build a credible audit trail and demonstrates adherence to good scientific practice in at least *some* areas. This can serve as a form of plausible deniability or a way to deflect suspicion from other, less legitimate data handling decisions.\n3.  **Strategic Choices in Misconduct:** Misconduct is often selective. Lena might be manipulating other aspects of the data or analysis (e.g., p-hacking, changing preregistration parameters), but she would still follow basic, undeniably correct procedures for egregious data quality issues. Fabricating a reason to exclude a participant when a legitimate, obvious reason already exists would be unnecessary and introduce unneeded risk.\n\nTherefore, the proper exclusion and documentation of these two participants is entirely consistent with, and perhaps even advantageous for, a researcher who might be committing academic misconduct elsewhere in the study.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence presented, there are strong indicators pointing towards academic misconduct.\n\nHere's a summary of the most impactful pieces of evidence and their implications:\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct (low probability if no misconduct):**\n\n1.  **Preregistration document modified after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes:** This is a critical red flag. The purpose of preregistration is to *prevent* post-hoc changes influenced by observed data. If Lena were honest, the likelihood of her altering the *original* document (rather than documenting a transparent amendment) for such fundamental aspects is very low (5% likelihood if no misconduct). If she committed misconduct, this is a highly probable tactic (95% likelihood).\n2.  **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with almost no p-values just above .05 for exploratory analyses:** This is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. Such a distribution is statistically highly improbable to occur by chance in genuine exploratory analyses (5% likelihood if no misconduct). If Lena committed misconduct, this is a highly probable outcome of efforts to achieve \"significant\" findings (95% likelihood).\n\n**Evidence that provides motive or context, but doesn't strongly differentiate between misconduct/no misconduct (high probability in both scenarios):**\n\n1.  **Emails expressing intense pressure:** Lena's statements about the grant, her postdoc chances, and needing the study \"to work\" are highly likely whether she is honest or engaging in misconduct (95% likelihood in both). They clearly establish a strong motive for misconduct if she chose that path.\n2.  **Earlier script with more participants, later excluded:** This is common practice for data cleaning in either scenario (90% likelihood in both). Its significance depends on the *reasons* for exclusion.\n3.  **Lab-wide push for robustness/multiple analysis scripts:** This is good scientific practice but also provides a convenient cover for p-hacking (95% likelihood if no misconduct, 90% if misconduct). The \"other students show similar patterns\" aspect makes it appear more legitimate.\n4.  **Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure leading to missing files:** These are mundane technical issues that could happen to anyone (90% likelihood in both). However, they also serve as a convenient excuse for missing data or analysis history if misconduct occurred.\n\n**Evidence that somewhat mitigates against pervasive misconduct, but doesn't rule out targeted misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Prior record of passing independent audits and \"well-documented and reproducible\" work:** This is strong evidence of prior good practice (95% likelihood if no misconduct). However, it doesn't preclude a \"first-time offender\" scenario under extreme pressure (70% likelihood if misconduct).\n2.  **Legitimate exclusion of participants (fell asleep, didn't understand instructions) with notes predating submission:** This shows adherence to basic, ethical data quality control (98% likelihood if no misconduct, 90% if misconduct). It suggests Lena isn't entirely careless or fraudulent, but could still be selectively manipulating other aspects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe direct evidence of a manipulated preregistration and the highly suspicious p-value distribution are extremely difficult to reconcile with a scenario of \"no academic misconduct\" through honest error or chance. These are not minor irregularities but fundamental violations of research integrity. While Lena has a good prior record and some legitimate practices, these do not negate the strong indications of deliberate manipulation in this specific high-stakes project. The intense pressure she expressed provides a clear motive.\n\nGiven the very low probability of the preregistration alteration and p-value clustering occurring without misconduct, combined with the high probability of these events occurring *with* misconduct, the overall probability leans heavily towards Lena having committed academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"
