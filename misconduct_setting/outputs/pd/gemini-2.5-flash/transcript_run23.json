The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the act of changing primary outcomes and exclusion criteria *after* data collection is a direct mechanism for *falsifying* the research process itself, potentially leading to biased or misleading results.\n\nHere's why it's unlikely for an innocent Lena:\n*   **Contradiction of Preregistration Purpose:** Such post-hoc changes fundamentally undermine the integrity and transparency that preregistration aims to achieve. It suggests that the analysis plan was altered to fit the observed data, which is antithetical to unbiased research.\n*   **Proximity to Misconduct:** While not directly fabricating raw data points, changing key analytical parameters (primary outcomes, exclusion criteria) *after seeing the data* to obtain \"strong, statistically significant support\" is a form of manipulating the presentation of results and the scientific process. It can be considered a form of falsification of the research design and its reporting. It directly serves to make results \"look too perfect.\"\n*   **Lack of Innocent Explanation for *Substantive* Changes:** While minor corrections or clarifications to a preregistration might be conceivable, changing *primary outcomes* and *exclusion criteria* after data collection are substantive changes that directly influence the statistical significance and interpretation of findings.

This intent to steer findings towards significance is precisely what misconduct often entails.\n\nTherefore, if Lena truly did not commit academic misconduct (i.e., had no intention to manipulate or mislead), it is highly improbable that she would engage in an action so directly and severely compromising to research integrity and so readily capable of producing \"too perfect\" results.

There is no natural or statistical phenomenon that would cause such a sharp, artificial cutoff precisely at the .05 threshold, with values \"bunching up\" just below it and disappearing just above.\n*   **The .05 Threshold is Arbitrary:** The .05 significance threshold is a convention, not a natural property of data. For p-values to coincidentally cluster so tightly just below this arbitrary line, and be absent just above it, strongly suggests that the analyses or their reporting were influenced by the desire to achieve statistical significance.\n*   **Absence of Innocent Explanations:** There is no known \"honest mistake\" or \"mundane explanation\" that would systematically produce this specific statistical fingerprint across multiple analyses. A computational error might alter a p-value, but it wouldn't consistently push multiple non-significant p-values just below .05 while eliminating those that fall just above.\n*   **Direct Contradiction of \"No Misconduct\":** If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it means she did not intentionally manipulate data or selectively report findings to achieve significance. The described p-value distribution is a direct symptom of such intentional manipulation (p-hacking, HARKing, selective reporting). Therefore, these two statements are largely contradictory.\n\nWhile true significance might yield a cluster of low p-values, the *specific* pattern described (concentration *just below* .05 and *absence just above*) is the critical indicator of non-random, biased selection or manipulation.\n\nProbability judgment: 2"

If an analysis initially yields a p-value of, say, .06 or .07, an individual committing misconduct might make slight adjustments (e.g., removing an outlier, adding a covariate, transforming a variable) specifically to push that p-value below .05.\n*   **Achieving \"Significance\":** The goal of p-hacking is precisely to ensure that analyses appear \"statistically significant.\" This leads directly to a clustering of p-values just below the arbitrary .05 cutoff, as non-significant results just above this threshold would either be manipulated to become significant or simply not reported (if it's exploratory analysis where selective reporting is easier).\n*   **Conforming to Pressure:** Given Lena's internal pressure (\"I need this one to work,\" \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\") and external pressure (\"supervisor was counting on this study\"), engaging in practices like p-hacking would be a very direct way to ensure the study \"works\" by producing the desired statistically significant results.\n*   **\"Too Perfect\" Results:** This p-value distribution contributes directly to the overall impression that the data \"look too perfect,\" as it suggests an artificial smoothing of results to consistently hit the significance mark.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in academic misconduct with the intent to generate significant findings, this particular pattern in the p-values is not just probable, but is a highly characteristic outcome of such behavior.\n\nProbability judgment: 98"

For instance, initial broad criteria might become more specific based on observed data quality (e.g., participants failing attention checks, consistently giving non-sensical responses, or having incomplete data due to technical glitches).\n2.  **Discovery of Technical Issues:** During preliminary analysis, technical problems might be identified that render certain participants' data unusable (e.g., equipment malfunction, corrupted files, software errors for specific sessions).\n3.  **Performance-Based Exclusions:** Participants might be excluded due to not meeting pre-defined performance thresholds (e.g., accuracy too low, reaction times too fast/slow to be plausible), which are often applied after initial data collection.\n4.  **Updated Understanding of the Data:** As a researcher gains a deeper understanding of their dataset, they might realize that certain participants, for legitimate scientific reasons (e.g., outliers that skew distributions, participants who didn't fully understand instructions despite initial screening), should be excluded from the final analysis.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants simply reflects an earlier stage of data processing, likely before all cleaning and exclusion criteria were fully applied or before all data quality issues were identified. If Lena did not commit misconduct, these exclusions would be based on legitimate, objective, and scientifically justifiable reasons, rather than being driven by a desire to achieve specific statistical outcomes.

A clean record would provide a strong shield against suspicion if questions ever arose, making any future misconduct harder to detect or attribute.\n4.  **Nature of Previous Audits:** The audits might have been for less complex or less high-stakes projects, or the specific types of subtle data manipulation (like p-hacking or selective exclusion) might have been harder to detect in those contexts, or simply not present.\n\nWhile an individual prone to misconduct *might* have a history of irregularities, it is also plausible that someone who commits misconduct does so selectively, under specific extreme pressures, or for the first time. Their prior clean record can make their current actions harder to believe and investigate.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it means she is operating with scientific integrity and adherence to best practices. The scenario described is perfectly aligned with, and in fact, indicative of such ethical and rigorous research.\n\nHere's why it's highly likely:\n\n1.  **Exploring Robustness:** The explicit statement that this was \"part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" is key. Robustness analyses, which involve testing how results hold up under different analytical choices (like varying exclusion criteria, statistical models, or covariates), are considered excellent scientific practice. They demonstrate a commitment to understanding the limitations and generalizability of findings, rather than simply trying to get a significant p-value.\n2.  **Transparent and Documented Iteration:** Running and *storing* multiple scripts with different choices, and having these logged by data management systems, indicates transparency and good data stewardship. It shows the analytical process was not a one-off, but an iterative exploration, which is normal and healthy in complex data analysis.\n3.  **Lab-Wide Practice:** The fact that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" reinforces that this is a recognized and encouraged methodology within the research group. It's a standard operating procedure for the lab, not a suspicious individual act.\n4.  **Counter-argument to Misconduct:** This behavior directly contrasts with the behaviors associated with p-hacking or selective reporting. Instead of hiding alternative analyses that didn't yield desired results, it demonstrates a systematic exploration of how results vary across reasonable analytical choices.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is conducting research ethically and without misconduct, this practice is not just likely but expected for a conscientious researcher in a lab committed to high-quality science.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it implies she intentionally manipulated her research to achieve specific outcomes, likely statistically significant results, especially given the high pressure she was under.\n\nHowever, the scenario described – running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts for robustness checks, and this being a lab-wide push with similar patterns among other students – is a *lab-level practice*.\n\nHere's why it's still likely even if Lena committed misconduct:\n\n1.  **Conforming to Lab Norms:** As a PhD student, Lena would be expected to adhere to the standard operating procedures and best practices promoted within her lab. If the lab has a \"push to explore robustness,\" she would likely participate in this practice, regardless of whether she simultaneously engaged in misconduct for her primary findings.\n2.  **Creating a Plausible Cover:** For someone engaged in misconduct, having a detailed paper trail of multiple analyses, including robustness checks, could serve as a plausible cover. If questions arose, she could point to these stored scripts as evidence of thorough and honest exploration, even if the final reported results were selectively chosen or manipulated from these or other analyses.\n3.  **Blurring the Lines:** The line between legitimate robustness exploration and p-hacking can sometimes be subtle. A researcher under pressure might genuinely run many analyses, and if the \"robustness\" checks don't yield the desired result, they might then, out of misconduct, cherry-pick the most favorable outcome, or make slight, unjustified tweaks until significance is achieved, still within the context of having run \"multiple scripts.\"\n4.  **Misconduct is Not Total Abandonment of Practice:** Committing misconduct in one aspect of a study doesn't mean a researcher abandons all good scientific practices. They might still follow lab protocols for data storage and analysis iteration, even while making unethical choices regarding which results to report or how to present them.\n\nTherefore, the existence of these scripts and their logging is an organizational practice of the lab. While Lena might misuse the *results* of such an exploration for misconduct, the *act* of performing and storing them is a separate, likely activity in that lab environment.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "The evidence presented offers a complex picture, with some elements pointing strongly towards academic misconduct and others offering plausible innocent explanations or highlighting a history of good practice. To determine the probability of misconduct, we must weigh the diagnostic value of each piece of evidence.\n\n**Evidence Strongly Suggesting Misconduct:**\n\n1.  **Preregistration Modified Post-Data Collection for Outcomes/Criteria:** This is a critical piece of evidence. Changing primary outcomes and exclusion criteria *after* data collection, as indicated by file timestamps, directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a textbook example of HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) or p-hacking the study design. This action is extremely unlikely for an innocent researcher (estimated 5% likelihood) but highly likely for someone committing misconduct (estimated 95% likelihood).\n2.  **Unusual P-Value Distribution:** The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. This pattern is exceedingly rare to occur by chance in honest research (estimated 2% likelihood) and is a highly characteristic outcome of intentional manipulation to achieve statistical significance (estimated 98% likelihood).\n\n**Evidence Providing Context/Motivation (but not direct proof of misconduct):**\n\n1.  **Emails about Pressure and Career Stakes:** Lena's emails express significant pressure from her supervisor (\"counting on this study to save the grant\") and high personal stakes (\"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"). This provides a strong *motive* for misconduct. However, feeling and expressing such pressure is common for PhD students even if they remain ethical (estimated 90% likelihood if innocent, 95% if guilty). Thus, while it explains *why* she might commit misconduct, it doesn't confirm *that* she did.\n\n**Evidence Offering Neutral or Mitigating Explanations (making misconduct less straightforward):**\n\n1.  **Earlier Script with More Participants, Later Excluded:** While participant exclusion can be a tool for misconduct, it is also a routine part of data cleaning. Given the changed preregistration, this *could* be suspicious (estimated 90% if guilty). However, the existence of a prior script with more participants is not unusual even for innocent researchers as criteria are refined (estimated 85% if innocent). The *justification* for these specific exclusions, especially in light of the modified preregistration, is key.\n2.  **Legitimate Exclusion of Two Participants (Asleep/Misunderstood):** The exclusion of two participants based on contemporaneous notes for valid reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) is excellent research practice. This demonstrates that Lena *can* and *does* apply appropriate exclusion criteria. This is highly likely regardless of whether she committed misconduct in other areas (estimated 95% for both innocent and guilty). This factor weighs against a wholesale pattern of fraudulent exclusions.\n3.  **Lab Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure:** These are \"mundane explanations\" for missing files or inconsistencies. They are external technical/logistical issues that are equally likely to occur regardless of Lena's conduct (estimated 80% for both innocent and guilty). They do not explain the patterns of misconduct but could be leveraged as excuses.\n4.  **No Prior Record of Data Irregularities, Passed Audit:** Lena's clean prior record and positive audit ratings are strong indicators of previous ethical and competent work (estimated 95% if innocent). This makes it harder to believe she would commit misconduct now. However, it is possible for individuals to succumb to pressure for the first time, especially in high-stakes situations (estimated 70% if guilty).\n5.  **Lab-Wide Push for Robustness, Multiple Scripts Stored:** The lab's practice of exploring robustness by running and storing multiple analysis scripts, including varying exclusion criteria, is a sign of good scientific practice. Lena's participation in this (similar to other students) suggests adherence to lab norms that promote transparency. This is highly likely if innocent (estimated 95% likelihood). If guilty, she might still participate in these practices, potentially using them to cover her tracks or selectively report results from a broad exploration (estimated 85% likelihood).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two most compelling pieces of evidence are the post-data collection modification of the preregistration document (changing primary outcomes and exclusion criteria) and the highly unusual p-value distribution (concentration just below .05 with an absence above). These are direct, strong indicators of intentional manipulation of the research process and results, which are extremely unlikely to occur in honest research.\n\nWhile Lena has some mitigating factors (a good prior record, legitimate exclusions, the lab's robustness push), these do not sufficiently counteract the highly diagnostic evidence of manipulation. A clean past record does not preclude a first instance of misconduct under extreme pressure. The legitimate exclusions for specific cases do not rule out illegitimate exclusions or manipulations in other cases. The lab's robustness push could be a framework within which selective reporting occurred.\n\nThe collective weight of the evidence, particularly the two \"smoking gun\" indicators of altered preregistration and p-hacking, makes it highly probable that Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"
