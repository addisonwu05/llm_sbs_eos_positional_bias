The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The pattern of p-values described—an unusually high concentration just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05—is a classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting.\n\nIf Lena did *not* commit academic misconduct, this implies that:\n1.  **Her data are genuine and untampered with.** There was no fabrication or falsification of raw data points.\n2.  **Her analytical choices were made transparently and without bias towards achieving statistical significance.** This means she did not repeatedly run different analyses, exclude \"inconvenient\" data, or make post-hoc analytical adjustments specifically to push p-values below the .05 threshold. She also did not selectively report only those exploratory analyses that happened to yield significant results while omitting others that did not.\n\nUnder these conditions (no intentional manipulation, no selective reporting, no p-hacking):\n\n*   **Genuine Effects:** If there were true underlying effects for these exploratory analyses, the p-values would still be subject to natural sampling variability. You would expect a distribution where some p-values naturally fall just above .05 (e.g., .051, .052) due to random chance, even if the true effect were strong. A sharp, abrupt cut-off at exactly .05 is highly uncharacteristic of genuine data, as it implies an artificial boundary rather than a natural distribution.\n*   **Chance:** For \"several exploratory analyses\" to coincidentally produce this exact pattern (a concentration just below .05 and a void just above) purely by random chance is exceedingly improbable. The probability of one such instance happening by chance is low; the probability of *several* such instances is astronomically lower. P-values are continuous; for them to repeatedly \"cluster\" just on one side of an arbitrary threshold without intervention is statistically anomalous.\n*   **\"Honest mistakes or miscommunication\":** While these might explain issues like missing files or inconsistencies in reporting, they do not provide a mechanism for systematically skewing p-values to fall just below a specific threshold across multiple analyses.\n*   **Software changes or hard drive failures:** These could explain data loss or messy records, but they cannot explain the statistical properties of the *remaining* analyzed data in this specific, biased way.\n\nTherefore, if Lena truly did not commit any form of academic misconduct (including p-hacking or selective reporting), the observed pattern of p-values would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur.\n\n1"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, particularly with the goal of achieving statistically significant and publishable results, the described pattern of p-values is not only likely but highly characteristic of such behavior.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **P-hacking/Selective Reporting:** This is the most direct explanation. If Lena engaged in p-hacking, she would have performed multiple exploratory analyses, tweaked analytical parameters, or selectively reported results until p-values fell below the arbitrary .05 significance threshold. If a p-value was, for instance, .06 or .07, she might make minor (or major) adjustments to the analysis (e.g., outlier removal, transformation, inclusion of covariates, choice of statistical test) specifically to nudge it below .05. She would then report these \"successful\" results and omit or disregard those that fell just above the threshold. This process directly creates a \"pile-up\" of p-values just below .05 and a corresponding \"cliff\" or \"void\" just above it.\n\n2.  **Falsification/Fabrication of Data:** If Lena were fabricating or falsifying data to achieve significant results, she would likely aim for p-values that are considered statistically significant. While she could aim for extremely low p-values (e.g., p < .001), aiming for values just below .05 might be perceived as more \"natural\" or less suspicious than repeatedly reporting exceptionally strong effects, especially in exploratory analyses. If her initial (simulated or real) results were close but not significant, and she then manipulated data to push them across the threshold, this would also result in the observed clustering.\n\n3.  **Incentives:** The context explicitly states that her supervisor is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" Such pressure provides a strong incentive to ensure results are statistically significant, making practices like p-hacking or selective reporting more likely if misconduct were to occur.\n\nIn the field of research integrity and statistical forensics, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with a sharp drop-off above it is widely considered a tell-tale sign of p-hacking or other forms of questionable research practices aimed at achieving statistical significance. It's precisely what one would expect to see if someone were strategically manipulating their analyses or reporting to get \"publishable\" results.\n\n95"

Supervisors are indeed reliant on successful studies for grant renewals, and PhD students' career prospects (like securing a postdoc) are heavily influenced by the publishability of their research findings. These are objective realities of the academic system.\n2.  **Human Emotion and Stress:** Researchers, regardless of their integrity, are human beings who experience stress, anxiety, and strong desires for success. When faced with high stakes – a supervisor's grant, their own career future – it is entirely normal to feel and express these pressures to a trusted friend.\n3.  **\"I need this one to work\":** This phrase, in particular, can be interpreted as an expression of hope and aspiration, not necessarily an intent to manipulate. An ethical researcher who has invested years into a project and genuinely believes in their theory would naturally *want* the experiment to yield supportive, significant results. Wanting a study to \"work\" can mean wanting the data to genuinely support the hypothesis, thereby validating their hard work and theoretical predictions, rather than implying a readiness to falsify data.\n4.  **Private Communication:** These are emails to a friend, not official statements. People often express their deepest anxieties, hopes, and frustrations more openly and emotionally in private communications than they would in public or professional settings.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena were scrupulously honest and committed to research integrity, the immense pressure she was under would almost certainly lead her to feel and articulate these very concerns and desires in private correspondence.\n\n90"

These emails articulate the very pressures that could lead someone to make unethical choices.\n2.  **Internal Justification/Rationalization:** For someone contemplating or engaging in misconduct, these pressures can serve as a powerful internal justification. The belief that \"I need this for my career\" or \"the lab needs this for funding\" can rationalize actions that are otherwise known to be wrong.\n3.  **Expression of Stress and Desire:** Even if she committed misconduct, Lena is still a person experiencing intense stress and desire for success. She would naturally articulate these feelings to a trusted friend, regardless of her subsequent actions. The emails express the *why* behind potentially unethical actions, not necessarily the *how*.\n4.  **No Contradiction:** There is no contradiction between feeling immense pressure and then acting on that pressure in an unethical way. In fact, the two are often causally linked.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in misconduct, it is entirely consistent, and indeed highly probable, that she would have been feeling and expressing these exact pressures and desires.

Initial data runs might be performed on all collected data, but as researchers examine the data quality, understand participant behavior better, or identify issues that were not initially apparent, they might apply stricter or more specific exclusion rules. For example, participants might be excluded for:\n    *   Failing manipulation checks or attention checks.\n    *   Not following instructions adequately.\n    *   Having excessively noisy or incomplete data due to technical glitches or participant disengagement.\n    *   Meeting pre-defined, but perhaps not yet implemented in the initial script, data quality thresholds (e.g., accuracy below a certain percentage, reaction times outside a plausible range).\n2.  **Iterative Process of Analysis:** Data analysis is often an iterative process. An \"earlier version\" of a script suggests exactly this: a researcher might run a preliminary analysis on a broader dataset, then review the results, identify problematic participants or data points, and then update their script to exclude those participants for the final, cleaner analysis.\n3.  **Software/Methodology Changes:** The fact that the lab recently switched software could contribute to this. Lena might have initially processed data using one method or script, and then adapted it for the new software, leading to refinements in how participants were handled or excluded based on new capabilities or stricter standards.\n4.  **Documentation of Decisions:** While the exclusion itself might be legitimate, the key for avoiding misconduct allegations is transparently documenting *why* participants were excluded. The existence of an earlier script that included more participants simply indicates a change in the dataset, which is a normal part of the scientific process, provided the reasons for exclusion are sound and not data-driven in a biased way.\n\nTherefore, the mere fact of participant exclusion between an earlier and later script, *by itself*, is not inherently suspicious or indicative of misconduct. It's a plausible part of rigorous data cleaning and analysis.\n\n70"

If initial analyses with the full dataset did not yield statistically significant results (e.g., p = .06, .07), a researcher engaging in misconduct might then \"clean\" the data by removing participants whose data points weaken the effect or push the p-value above the significance threshold. This could be done by:\n    *   Applying ad-hoc or post-hoc exclusion criteria that were not predefined or consistently applied.\n    *   Labeling certain participants as \"outliers\" without robust, pre-specified statistical justification, solely to improve the p-value.\n    *   Creating \"rules\" for exclusion that, coincidentally, only remove participants whose data goes against the hypothesis.\n2.  **Covering Tracks:** If the goal is to make the data \"look perfect\" (as suggested by the whistleblower), selectively removing participants who introduce noise or weaken the effect is a direct way to achieve this. The existence of an earlier script with more participants, from which some were later excluded, would be the natural byproduct of such a process.\n3.  **Pressure to \"Make it Work\":** Given the explicit pressure (\"supervisor counting on this study,\" \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" \"I need this one to work\"), and the observation of p-values clustering just below .05, it is very plausible that Lena would resort to such data manipulation techniques if the initial, broader analyses weren't yielding the desired results.\n\nIn essence, selectively excluding participants is a well-documented method of falsifying results (in a broad sense) by manipulating the dataset itself, rather than fabricating data from scratch. Therefore, the presence of an earlier script with more participants, from which some were later removed to reach the \"final dataset,\" is a highly probable outcome if misconduct involving data manipulation occurred.\n\n90"

She might have genuinely believed it was acceptable to \"correct\" or \"update\" the plan even after data collection, perhaps to reflect what she perceived as a better or more accurate approach, without realizing this fundamentally compromises the preregistration's value.\n2.  **Genuine Error in Original Preregistration:** It's possible the original preregistration contained a significant, undeniable error in stating the primary outcome or exclusion criteria, and Lena genuinely sought to correct it. However, even if the error was genuine, the best practice would be to note the *deviation* from the preregistration, explain it transparently, and publish both the original and modified documents, rather than simply overwriting the original. Modifying the document *silently* or without clear justification documented *before* the modification would be problematic even if the initial error was innocent.\n3.  **Supervisor Influence/Pressure (without intent to manipulate):** Professor Mills might have suggested or insisted on the changes, perhaps due to their own misunderstanding of preregistration rules or a desire to \"optimize\" the analysis plan, without an explicit intention to manipulate the outcomes to significance. Even in this scenario, Lena, as the researcher, bears responsibility for understanding and upholding research integrity.\n\nHowever, even if the *intent* was not malicious (i.e., not directly intending to defraud by altering the plan to fit observed results), making such changes *after* data collection is a significant methodological flaw that opens the door to unconscious bias and greatly diminishes the credibility of the preregistration. It creates the *appearance* of misconduct, even if the underlying motivation was an \"honest mistake\" or a severe lack of understanding about responsible conduct of research.\n\nGiven the critical nature of preregistration in modern science, and the importance of elements like primary outcomes and exclusion criteria, such post-data collection modifications are highly irregular and generally considered unacceptable practice. For this to occur without *any* intention to manipulate, fabricate, or bias the results would represent a profound lapse in judgment or understanding for a researcher at Lena's stage, or a serious systemic issue within the lab. While \"honest mistakes\" are generally plausible, this specific type of \"mistake\" is so directly contradictory to the purpose of preregistration that its likelihood without underlying problematic intent is very low.\n\n15"

If initial analyses based on the original preregistration did not yield the desired significant results, a researcher committing misconduct might:\n    *   **Change primary outcomes:** Identify a secondary outcome that *did* show a significant effect and retroactively declare it as the primary outcome. This makes it appear as though the significant finding was pre-planned.\n    *   **Change exclusion criteria:** Adjust the criteria for excluding participants to remove individuals whose data weaken the desired effect or push p-values above significance. This is a form of data manipulation aimed at achieving statistical significance.\n2.  **Rationalization and Covering Tracks:** For someone engaging in misconduct, modifying the preregistration document creates a false record that legitimizes analyses or exclusions that were actually post-hoc and data-driven. It serves to make questionable research practices appear as transparent, pre-planned scientific decisions. This makes it harder for external parties to detect that the research plan was changed after seeing the data.\n3.  **Pressure to \"Make it Work\":** Given the immense pressure Lena was under (supervisor's grant, her postdoc chances, \"I need this one to work\"), and the observed pattern of p-values clustering just below .05, manipulating the preregistration provides a plausible pathway to achieving \"publishable findings\" by making the results fit a seemingly pre-specified plan.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration document in this way would be a very effective and common strategy to facilitate achieving significant results and to obscure the data-driven nature of those choices.\n\n95"

Exploring the robustness of findings by varying analytical choices (like exclusion criteria) is a recognized and often recommended good scientific practice.

If Lena were committing misconduct (e.g., p-hacking), this established norm would provide a convenient cover. She could run numerous permutations, *ostensibly* to explore robustness, but in reality, be searching for the specific set of exclusion criteria that yielded a statistically significant result.\n2.  **Selective Reporting within a Legitimate Framework:** If misconduct involves selective reporting or p-hacking, Lena might genuinely run many different analyses (some with stricter, some with looser criteria) as part of her search for significance. She would then present only the analysis that produced the desired p-value in her final paper, while the logs would show all the exploratory (and discarded) analyses. This means the existence of multiple scripts is perfectly compatible with, and could even facilitate, p-hacking.\n3.  **Plausible Deniability:** In the event of an inquiry, the existence of these diverse scripts, fitting within a lab-wide policy, would offer a layer of plausible deniability.

Such data are considered invalid regardless of the researcher's intent or the outcome of the study.\n2.  **Improvement of Data Quality (and potential for easier manipulation):** Removing clearly invalid data improves the overall quality and \"cleanness\" of the dataset. For a researcher engaged in misconduct (e.g., p-hacking or selective reporting), starting with a cleaner, more reliable dataset can actually make it *easier* to find statistically significant results through other manipulations. Eliminating noise from invalid participants is a rational step even for someone with unethical intentions.\n3.  **Plausible Deniability and Appearance of Rigor:** Performing legitimate data exclusions and documenting them properly creates an appearance of thoroughness and good scientific practice.

This external verification strongly supports the legitimacy of this claim, making it a genuine technical issue rather than a fabricated excuse.\n3.  **Missing Files as a Consequence:** If these two events (software switch and hard drive failure) genuinely occurred, it is a very plausible consequence that some files would be missing. Data migration during a software switch is prone to issues, and a hard drive failure almost certainly results in some level of data loss or accessibility problems, even with recovery efforts.\n\nThese are unfortunate but plausible operational and technical difficulties that can arise in any research setting, completely independent of a researcher's integrity. They are not intrinsically linked to misconduct and, in fact, provide mundane explanations for some of the \"irregularities\" noted in the inquiry.\n\n90"

A lab-wide decision to switch software is an institutional or group-level change, and hardware failures are random technical occurrences. The IT department's confirmation further solidifies the independent, factual nature of the hard drive failure.\n2.  **Convenient Explanations for Irregularities:** While these events are independent of misconduct, their occurrence could be very convenient for someone who *is* committing misconduct. If Lena were fabricating or manipulating data, missing files due to a hard drive crash or inconsistencies arising from a software switch could provide plausible, truthful, and externally verifiable explanations for any data irregularities, missing original files, or analytical discrepancies that might otherwise point towards her misconduct. She could leverage these genuine difficulties to obscure her unethical actions.\n3.  **No Causal Link:** Lena's decision to commit misconduct does not cause a lab to switch software or a hard drive to fail. Therefore, the probability of these events themselves occurring is not fundamentally altered by her ethical choices. They simply represent the normal background noise and occasional misfortunes of a research environment.\n\nThus, the likelihood of these specific events occurring remains high, as they are common and confirmed occurrences in research settings, regardless of whether Lena is also engaged in misconduct.\n\n90"

    "content": "It is moderately likely that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, even if she did commit academic misconduct in the current study.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Situational Factors and Escalation:** Academic misconduct is not always a consistent trait or a lifelong pattern. It can be a response to immense pressure, perceived desperation, or a unique set of circumstances. The current study is described as \"high-profile,\" her supervisor is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review,\" and Lena feels a \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" and \"I need this one to work.\" These intense, possibly unprecedented, pressures could have pushed Lena to cross ethical boundaries for the first time in this specific, critical project.\n2.  **Learning from Experience/Opportunity:** It's possible that her previous good record reflected genuine adherence to best practices. However, having gone through an audit, she might have learned precisely what auditors look for, making any *future* attempts at misconduct more sophisticated and harder to detect.\n3.  **Nature of Misconduct:** If the current misconduct is primarily p-hacking, selective reporting, or modifying preregistration after seeing results (rather than outright fabrication of raw data from scratch), it might be a deviation from her usual carefulness driven by specific pressures. A researcher can be generally meticulous and \"well-documented and reproducible\" in their core data management, but still engage in post-hoc analytical manipulation or selective reporting when under extreme pressure for significance.\n4.  **Anomaly vs. Pattern:** A single instance of misconduct, or misconduct under extreme, new pressure, does not necessarily invalidate a long-standing, otherwise clean record. Many individuals who commit unethical acts do not have a history of such behavior, but rather succumb to specific, overwhelming pressures.\n\nTherefore, while a clean past record usually argues against current misconduct, it does not make it impossible. The fact that she had a clean record could highlight the extraordinary pressure or unique circumstances of *this* particular study as the driving force behind any misconduct.\n\n60"

    "content": "Based on the totality of the evidence:\n\n**Evidence Strongly Suggesting Academic Misconduct:**\n\n1.  **P-value Distribution:** The \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this pattern occurring by chance across \"several exploratory analyses\" is extremely low (judged as 1%). If she did commit misconduct, the likelihood is very high (judged as 95%). This is the most damning piece of evidence.\n2.  **Preregistration Modification:** The fact that the \"preregistration document was modified after the data had already been collected, changing some of the planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\" is a severe breach of research integrity. This practice directly facilitates HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) and p-hacking. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this happening is very low (judged as 15%). If she did, it's very likely (judged as 95%).\n3.  **Motivational Emails:** Lena's emails expressing that her supervisor was \"counting on this study,\" a \"null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and \"I need this one to work\" provide a clear and strong motivation for misconduct. While such expressions are plausible even without misconduct (judged as 90%), they are also very consistent with the pressures that drive individuals to engage in misconduct (judged as 95%).\n\n**Evidence that is Ambiguous or Mitigating (less indicative of misconduct):**\n\n1.  **Lab-wide Robustness Push / Multiple Scripts:** The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" resulting in \"multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria,\" with other students showing similar patterns, could be interpreted as good practice (judged as 95% if no misconduct). However, it also provides a convenient cover for p-hacking, where Lena could be running many analyses and selectively reporting the significant ones (judged as 95% if misconduct). This evidence does not strongly rule out misconduct.\n2.  **Exclusion of Problematic Participants:** The exclusion of two participants who fell asleep or did not understand instructions, with notes predating submission, is consistent with good data cleaning practice (judged as 99% if no misconduct). It is also consistent with misconduct, as even an unethical researcher would typically clean clearly invalid data to improve the overall quality of the dataset, which can make other manipulations easier (judged as 99% if misconduct). This does not strongly argue against misconduct.\n3.  **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure:** The lab's software switch and Lena's confirmed hard drive failure, leading to missing files, are independent technical and operational issues (judged as 90% likely if no misconduct). They are also very convenient, plausible explanations for any missing or inconsistent files that might arise from misconduct, providing plausible deniability (judged as 90% likely if misconduct). This evidence does not strongly rule out misconduct.\n4.  **Prior Clean Record:** Lena's \"previously strong record of careful data handling,\" having passed an independent data audit and rated as \"well-documented and reproducible,\" is the strongest piece of evidence *against* a pattern of misconduct (judged as 99% if no misconduct). However, it does not preclude a first-time transgression driven by extreme pressure in this specific high-stakes study (judged as 60% likely *even if* she committed misconduct *this time*).\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe evidence for misconduct is very specific and statistically powerful: the anomalous p-value distribution and the post-data collection modification of the preregistration document are considered \"red flags\" that are exceedingly unlikely to occur without intentional manipulation or highly biased reporting. These are not \"honest mistakes\" in the conventional sense.\n\nWhile Lena has a strong prior record, and there are mundane explanations for some irregularities (missing files, multiple scripts), these do not explain away the two critical pieces of evidence (p-value clustering and preregistration alteration) that are hallmarks of misconduct. The intense pressure Lena was under provides a clear motive.\n\nGiven the strength of the direct indicators of misconduct (p-values, preregistration), the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is very high.\n\n90"
