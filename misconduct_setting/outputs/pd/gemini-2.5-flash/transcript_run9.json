The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The question asks for the likelihood of a specific data pattern (\"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" for several exploratory analyses) *if* Lena did not commit academic misconduct. Academic misconduct is defined here as \"intentionally manipulated or fabricated data,\" as opposed to \"results being genuine/any errors being unintentional.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible explanations for this pattern, given the assumption of no intentional data manipulation or fabrication:\n\n1.  **Pure Chance:** It is extremely unlikely for such a specific and stark pattern (multiple p-values just below .05 with a clear void just above) to occur purely by chance, especially across \"several exploratory analyses.\" If there were no true effects and no problematic practices, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If some true effects existed, p-values would generally be skewed towards 0, but not create such a sharp cutoff at .05.\n\n2.  **Unintentional Errors/Mundane Explanations:** The case mentions a software switch and hard drive failure leading to missing files. While these could explain some irregularities, it is highly improbable they would systematically lead to p-values clustering just below .05 and disappearing just above this threshold. Such technical issues typically produce more random data loss or systematic errors unrelated to statistical significance.\n\n3.  **Unintentional Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** This is the most plausible explanation if intentional misconduct is ruled out. QRPs are methodological choices that, while not always involving outright data fabrication, can significantly bias results. They are often unintentional or performed without full awareness of their statistical implications. This scenario fits the \"errors being unintentional\" clause. Examples include:\n    *   **P-hacking (unconscious):** Running multiple exploratory analyses and making iterative analytical decisions (e.g., removing outliers, adding covariates, transforming data) until a statistically significant result (p < .05) is achieved, without pre-registering these decisions or fully understanding the inflated Type I error rate. The researcher might genuinely believe they are \"optimizing\" the analysis or \"finding the signal\" rather than manipulating data.\n    *   **Selective Reporting:** From a larger set of exploratory analyses, only reporting the ones that yielded statistically significant results, especially under pressure to produce \"publishable findings.\" The non-significant results are, in effect, ignored or not presented. If Lena ran many exploratory tests and only highlighted those that achieved significance, even if the other tests were genuinely non-significant, this would create the observed \"pile-up\" effect.\n\nGiven the context (third-year PhD student, supervisor pressure for \"publishable findings,\" exploratory analyses), it is quite plausible that Lena, even without malicious intent to defraud, could have engaged in such unintentional QRPs. The described p-value pattern is a classic signature of these practices. While these practices are serious methodological flaws and can lead to unreliable findings, they are often distinguished from *intentional fabrication or falsification* of data.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did *not* intentionally manipulate or fabricate data, it is moderately to highly likely that such a p-value pattern could still emerge due to unintentional but systematic questionable research practices driven by factors like pressure, lack of complete statistical awareness regarding exploratory analyses, or the \"garden of forking paths\" phenomenon.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"

If an analysis initially yielded a p-value of, for instance, .06 or .07, the most efficient and least obvious way to achieve significance would be to make minimal alterations to the data or analysis such that the p-value just barely dips below .05 (e.g., to .049, .047). Generating a p-value of .001 would require more extensive manipulation and might look *too* good, raising suspicion.\n\n3.  **Minimizing Effort and Risk:** To minimize the effort involved and the risk of detection, an individual engaging in misconduct would likely only alter data or analyses enough to achieve the desired significant outcome. This natural tendency would lead to a clustering of p-values just below the .05 mark. Non-significant p-values (e.g., .051, .053) would be seen as \"failures\" and would either be further manipulated until they crossed the threshold or would be entirely omitted from reporting (a form of selective reporting that, when intentional, constitutes misconduct).\n\n4.  **Classic Signature of Manipulation:** This specific pattern of p-values – a \"pile-up\" just below a conventional significance threshold and a void just above it – is a well-recognized statistical indicator of practices like p-hacking or data dredging, which can be unintentional (questionable research practices) or intentional (misconduct). If the misconduct is intentional, the researcher *wants* the significant results, and this pattern is a direct outcome of that intent.\n\nGiven that the goal of intentional misconduct in this scenario would be to produce publishable, significant results, deliberately manipulating data or selectively reporting to achieve p < .05 would almost inevitably lead to the observed pattern.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, meaning she did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data, and any errors were truly unintentional, then it is very unlikely that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Purpose of Preregistration:** The fundamental purpose of preregistration is to commit to a specific research plan (including hypotheses, primary outcomes, and exclusion criteria) *before* data collection and analysis. This transparency is crucial for preventing *post-hoc* changes that could bias results or create false positives. Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection fundamentally undermines its purpose and the integrity of the research process.\n\n2.  **Nature of the Changes:**\n    *   **Changing Exclusion Criteria:** Retroactively altering exclusion criteria can be used to remove participants or data points that do not support the desired hypothesis, thereby \"cleaning\" the dataset to produce statistically significant results. This is a form of p-hacking.\n    *   **Changing Primary Outcomes:** Switching primary outcomes after seeing the data is a clear instance of HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). This involves retrospectively identifying a significant result from exploratory analyses and then falsely claiming it as the original primary hypothesis, which misrepresents the scientific process.\n\n3.  **\"Unintentional Error\" vs. Deliberate Action:** It is extremely difficult to classify these specific changes as \"unintentional errors.\" An unintentional error typically refers to accidental mistakes like typos, coding errors, or mislabeled files. Retroactively rewriting core elements of a preregistration document after the results are known is a deliberate, conscious action, even if the researcher rationalizes it as \"improving\" the study or \"clarifying\" the plan. For a third-year PhD student, a basic understanding of preregistration's immutability would be expected.\n\n4.  **\"Genuine Results\":** If Lena's results were truly genuine and robust, there would be no scientific or ethical justification for retroactively altering the preregistration document's core elements. Such changes would only serve to make the findings *appear* more aligned with a pre-specified plan than they actually were, thereby misleading readers about the true nature of the research.\n\nWhile modifying a preregistration document is not *direct fabrication of raw data*, it is a deliberate manipulation of the scientific record and the research process. It is a severe questionable research practice that essentially creates the *appearance* of a pre-planned, clean study, even if the underlying data itself wasn't directly fabricated. If Lena truly did not have any intent to mislead or bias her results, this type of action would be highly incongruous with her claims of \"honest mistakes\" or \"unintentional errors.\"\n\nProbability Judgment: 10"

If initial analyses based on the *original* preregistration plan did not yield the desired results, Lena might:\n    *   **Change Primary Outcomes (HARKing):** After seeing the data and finding significant results in analyses that were initially exploratory (or not even planned), she could retrospectively declare these as the \"primary outcomes.\" Modifying the preregistration would create the false impression that these were her *a priori* hypotheses, thereby enhancing the apparent robustness and pre-planned nature of her findings.\n    *   **Change Exclusion Criteria:** If certain participants or data points were \"problematic\" (i.e., they diluted or obscured the desired effect), she might retroactively define new exclusion criteria to remove them. Modifying the preregistration to reflect these new criteria would serve to legitimize what would otherwise be considered data-dependent \"p-hacking\" or data dredging.\n\n2.  **Covering Tracks and Enhancing Credibility:** Modifying a preregistration document is a deliberate act of altering the scientific record. If Lena was already engaging in intentional misconduct (like data manipulation), she would likely seek to make her final published work appear as sound and legitimate as possible. An altered preregistration would serve as a powerful tool to:\n    *   **Mask P-Hacking:** It would hide the fact that analyses were changed based on preliminary results.\n    *   **Create a \"Clean Story\":** It would allow her to present a coherent narrative of hypothesis-driven research, even if the actual research process involved significant *post-hoc* adjustments.\n\n3.  **Strategic Deception:** Unlike an \"unintentional error,\" modifying a preregistration document with such significant changes *after* seeing the data is a conscious and strategic act of deception. It directly undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent such data-driven alterations. If Lena is already committed to intentional misconduct, this is a very effective way to make the misconduct less detectable and more justifiable in the public record.\n\nThis action is a clear hallmark of attempting to manufacture or enhance the appearance of scientific rigor and positive results when they might not genuinely exist according to the original plan.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

This process often happens iteratively.\n    *   **Data Quality Issues:** During initial data processing, a researcher might discover equipment malfunctions, significant noise in measurements, or errors during data acquisition for certain participants, rendering their data unusable.\n    *   **Participant Non-Compliance:** A participant might have completed the study, but upon closer inspection of their responses or behavior, it becomes clear they did not understand instructions, did not engage properly, or did not meet specific task performance thresholds.\n    *   **Refinement of Exclusion Criteria:** While pre-registration sets initial criteria, sometimes the nuances of specific exclusion rules (e.g., precise outlier thresholds, response time cutoffs) become clearer or need slight adjustments only after reviewing the collected data. If these adjustments are made based on genuine methodological considerations and not to bias results, they fall within legitimate research practice, even if not explicitly pre-registered at the most granular level.\n\n2.  **Iterative Nature of Analysis:** Researchers typically run preliminary analyses or data checks as data comes in or after collection. An \"earlier version of the analysis script\" suggests an initial pass at the data. It's common for these early scripts to be less refined in terms of exclusions compared to a final version, which incorporates all identified data quality issues.\n\n3.  **Unintentional Questionable Research Practices (QRPs):** Even without intentional misconduct, a researcher under pressure might, in an effort to \"clean\" the data or improve signal-to-noise ratio, inadvertently engage in *post-hoc* exclusions that, while not intentionally fraudulent, might still bias results (a form of p-hacking). However, since the question specifies \"did not commit academic misconduct\" (implying no *intentional* fraud), such unintentional QRPs would still fall under the umbrella of \"errors being unintentional.\"\n\nGiven these points, the existence of an earlier script with more participants than the final dataset is a common occurrence in the scientific process, driven by legitimate data cleaning, quality control, and the iterative nature of data analysis. While these exclusions must always be transparently reported and justified, their mere existence does not automatically imply intentional misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

If initial analyses (perhaps using the earlier script with all participants) did not yield the desired \"strong, statistically significant support for the theory,\" Lena, intending misconduct, would look for ways to achieve those results. Removing \"problematic\" participants (those whose data weaken the effect or push p-values above .05) is a direct way to \"clean\" the data and enhance the desired outcome.\n\n2.  **Iterative Nature of P-Hacking/Falsification:** Intentional misconduct often isn't a single, brute-force fabrication. It can involve an iterative process of running analyses, observing results, and then making post-hoc methodological decisions (like exclusions) to push findings towards significance. An earlier script with more participants could represent a stage before these intentional, outcome-driven exclusions were made.\n\n3.  **Consistency with Other Indicators:**\n    *   The observed \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic signature of p-hacking. Strategically excluding participants is a primary mechanism for generating such a pattern.\n    *   The modification of preregistration exclusion criteria *after* data collection strongly supports the idea that exclusions were results-driven rather than pre-planned. If Lena was committing misconduct, she would make the exclusions and then alter the preregistration to legitimize them.\n\nIn essence, if Lena intended to fabricate or manipulate data to get publishable findings, selectively excluding participants after seeing their impact on the results would be a very logical and powerful tool to achieve that goal. The existence of an earlier script showing more participants perfectly fits this narrative of post-hoc, outcome-driven exclusions.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

It's a common and acknowledged reality in academia that funding and publication success are critical for lab survival and individual career progression.\n2.  **Career Stakes for PhD Students:** For a third-year PhD student, a successful, publishable study (especially a \"high-profile experiment testing a new theory\") is often seen as essential for securing a good postdoctoral position and advancing their career. A \"null result\" (failure to find the predicted effect) can indeed be perceived as a significant setback, regardless of its scientific merit.\n3.  **Human Emotion and Stress:** These emails are to a friend, suggesting a candid and private expression of Lena's genuine feelings, anxieties, and aspirations.

If Lena felt unable to deliver publishable results legitimately, this pressure could push her towards misconduct to meet expectations.\n    *   **Personal Career Stakes:** The fear that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" represents a significant personal incentive.

Her past record would genuinely reflect good practices if the specific pressures leading to misconduct were not present or as intense previously.\n2.  **Skill vs. Ethics:** The ability to handle data carefully, document thoroughly, and produce reproducible scripts (skills assessed by an audit) is distinct from the ethical decision to manipulate or fabricate data.

A software switch \"halfway through the project\" is inconvenient but a common logistical challenge in research and does not inherently suggest misconduct. It's a decision or event external to Lena's ethical intentions.\n2.  **Hard Drive Failure:** Laptop hard drives can and do fail. This is a common hardware issue. The fact that the IT department confirms a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time lends significant credibility to this explanation. Losing some files as a result of a hard drive crash is an unfortunate but entirely plausible and non-malicious consequence.\n3.  **\"Mundane Explanations\":** The prompt explicitly frames these as \"mundane explanations.\" If Lena is not committing misconduct, then these are precisely the kinds of everyday technical and logistical challenges that can lead to irregularities or missing data, without any malicious intent.\n\nBoth events are independent of Lena's ethical conduct and represent common occurrences in a busy research environment. Their presence, if Lena is innocent of misconduct, would simply be an unfortunate set of circumstances contributing to data management challenges.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95"

Labs switch software for various reasons (upgrades, cost, new features), and hard drives can fail due to hardware defects or age. The IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure further validates its authenticity. These are \"mundane explanations\" as stated in the case.\n2.  **Convenient Cover for Misconduct:** While these events are not *caused* by misconduct, their occurrence could be highly convenient for someone engaged in academic misconduct.\n    *   **Missing Files:** Missing files due to a hard drive failure or issues related to a software switch could provide plausible excuses for the absence of original raw data, earlier analysis scripts, or full documentation that might expose fabrication or manipulation.\n    *   **Data Irregularities:** Inconsistencies or irregularities introduced by a software conversion or data recovery could be blamed on these technical issues, rather than on intentional manipulation.\n\nTherefore, even if Lena were engaged in misconduct, these technical and logistical challenges are still very common in research settings. Their existence would not be less likely; if anything, they might offer her convenient pretexts.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95"

This is a legitimate scientific endeavor aimed at ensuring that findings are not artifacts of a single analytical choice.\n2.  **Common Practice Among Peers:** The fact that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" further reinforces that this is a standard, expected, and accepted part of the lab's research methodology. It is not an anomalous behavior unique to Lena.\n3.  **Good Scientific Practice (when transparent):** Exploring the robustness of results to different analytical choices is, in itself, a good scientific practice. While *selectively reporting* only the significant results from such explorations without acknowledging the multiple comparisons would be a questionable research practice (p-hacking), the act of *running and storing* the scripts to explore robustness is not misconduct. If Lena is not committing misconduct, her intent behind these analyses would be legitimate scientific exploration.\n4.  **No Malicious Intent Implied:** The premise is that Lena did not commit academic misconduct. Therefore, the existence of these multiple scripts would be consistent with her following lab protocols and engaging in rigorous, albeit potentially iterative, data analysis.\n\nThis scenario describes standard (and often laudable) scientific exploration, particularly when conducted transparently and as part of a lab-wide initiative.\n\nProbability Judgment: 98"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **extremely likely** that the lab’s data management logs would still show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Lab-Wide Policy and Environment:** The scenario explicitly states this practice is \"part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\" This means it's a standard, expected, and institutionalized practice within Professor Mills' lab. Lena, as a third-year PhD student, would be expected to follow these lab protocols regardless of her ethical intent on a specific project.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Legitimacy:** A researcher engaging in misconduct rarely fabricates *every* aspect of their work from scratch. They often embed their fraudulent actions within an otherwise legitimate-looking research process. Following established lab procedures, such as running robustness checks, contributes to this appearance of normal, diligent scientific practice, which could help mask any underlying misconduct.\n3.  **Plausible Deniability and Justification:** If Lena were engaged in p-hacking or selective reporting, the existence of multiple scripts for \"robustness\" could provide her with a convenient excuse or rationalization. She could argue that her eventual analytical choices were merely part of the lab's accepted method for exploring the boundaries of the data, even if her *true* motive for selecting a particular script was to achieve statistical significance.\n\nTherefore, the existence of these scripts is a characteristic of the lab's operating procedure, and Lena would almost certainly adhere to it, whether she was conducting ethical research or simultaneously engaging in misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 98"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to integrate the information from all pieces of evidence, weighing their likelihood under both scenarios (misconduct vs. no misconduct).\n\nLet's recap the probability judgments for each piece of evidence:\n\n1.  **E1: P-value concentration (unusually high concentration just below .05, very few just above):**\n    *   $P(E_1 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 70 (due to unintentional QRPs/p-hacking)\n    *   $P(E_1 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 95 (intentional manipulation aims for this)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This pattern strongly suggests results-driven analysis. While unintentional QRPs can lead to it, intentional manipulation is an even better explanation.\n\n2.  **E2: Preregistration modification (changed exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection):**\n    *   $P(E_2 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 10 (very unlikely for unintentional error)\n    *   $P(E_2 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 90 (likely done to legitimize post-hoc changes)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This is highly incriminating. Retroactively altering core study parameters fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is very difficult to attribute to an \"unintentional error\" or \"miscommunication.\" It's a deliberate act of altering the scientific record.\n\n3.  **E3: Excluded participants from earlier script (more participants in early script):**\n    *   $P(E_3 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 85 (standard data cleaning)\n    *   $P(E_3 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 90 (strategic data manipulation)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This evidence is not very discriminating. Both innocent and guilty researchers perform data cleaning, and selective exclusion can be a tool of misconduct.\n\n4.  **E4: Emails expressing pressure (supervisor counting on study, null result hurts postdoc chances, \"I need this one to work\"):**\n    *   $P(E_4 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 90 (normal human reaction to pressure)\n    *   $P(E_4 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 98 (strong motivation for misconduct)\n    *   *Interpretation:* These emails highlight Lena's immense pressure and motivation for a positive outcome, which are common drivers for misconduct, but also natural feelings for an innocent researcher in a high-stakes situation.\n\n5.  **E5: Legitimate exclusions (two participants fell asleep/didn't understand, notes predate submission):**\n    *   $P(E_5 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 95 (standard, ethical practice)\n    *   $P(E_5 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 90 (even if committing misconduct, one would still do legitimate cleaning)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This evidence slightly favors innocence, as it demonstrates good, ethical data handling for clearly problematic data. However, a dishonest researcher would still make such legitimate exclusions to maintain credibility.\n\n6.  **E6: Clean prior record (passed audit, well-documented/reproducible):**\n    *   $P(E_6 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 98 (consistent with good practice)\n    *   $P(E_6 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 75 (misconduct can be context-specific, skill vs. ethics)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This is the strongest evidence *against* misconduct. It suggests Lena has a history of integrity and good practice. However, it doesn't preclude a lapse under extreme pressure.\n\n7.  **E7: Technical issues (software switch, confirmed hard drive failure leading to missing files):**\n    *   $P(E_7 | \\text{No Misconduct})$ = 95 (mundane, common occurrences)\n    *   $P(E_7 | \\text{Misconduct})$ = 95 (mundane, common occurrences, can also provide cover)\n    *   *Interpretation:* This evidence is neutral. These are common issues that can genuinely occur but could also serve as plausible excuses for missing data in a misconduct scenario.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe most compelling pieces of evidence are:\n\n*   **Preregistration Modification (E2):** This is extremely difficult to reconcile with \"unintentional error.\" Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes *after* data collection directly contradicts scientific transparency and is a deliberate act of post-hoc justification, which is a hallmark of misconduct. The low probability of this occurring if Lena were innocent (10%) makes this a very strong indicator of misconduct.\n*   **P-value Concentration (E1):** The unusually tight clustering of p-values just below .05 is a well-known signature of results-driven analysis (p-hacking). While unintentional, systematic biases can lead to this, it is significantly more likely if there was intentional manipulation to achieve significance.\n\nCounteracting these are:\n\n*   **Clean Prior Record (E6):** This suggests a history of good practice and integrity. However, it's plausible that the intense, stated pressure of *this specific project* (E4) led to a deviation from her usual ethical conduct.\n\nOther evidence, like the legitimate exclusions (E5), earlier scripts with more participants (E3), and technical issues (E7), are less discriminating or can be explained under both scenarios, with E4 providing a strong motive for misconduct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe strength of the evidence pointing to deliberate manipulation of the research process (E2 - altering preregistration) and the results (E1 - p-value clustering) is very high. While Lena's previous good record (E6) is a mitigating factor, the specific and deliberate nature of the actions described in E1 and E2 are very difficult to explain as \"unintentional errors\" or \"honest mistakes,\" especially given the context of extreme pressure (E4). The retrospective modification of preregistration, in particular, is an act of altering the scientific record in a way that is profoundly inconsistent with an honest research process.\n\nTherefore, despite her previous good standing, the pattern of highly questionable actions within this specific project strongly points towards intentional academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"
