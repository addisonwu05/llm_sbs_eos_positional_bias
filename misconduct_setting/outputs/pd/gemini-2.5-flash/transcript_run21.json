The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that an earlier analysis script would include participants who were later excluded from the final dataset. This is a common and often necessary part of the research process for several legitimate reasons:\n\n1.  **Data Cleaning and Exclusion Criteria:** Researchers routinely apply pre-defined or emergent exclusion criteria to their raw data. Participants might be excluded for reasons such as:\n    *   Failing manipulation checks (e.g., not understanding instructions, not paying attention).\n    *   Poor data quality (e.g., excessive noise in physiological recordings, technical malfunctions during data collection for specific participants).\n    *   Non-compliance with task instructions or experimental procedures.\n    *   Outlier data points that are statistical anomalies rather than true effects, based on established protocols.\n    *   Incomplete data due to participant withdrawal or technical issues.\n    An \"earlier analysis script\" would naturally precede the final application of these rigorous data cleaning steps.\n\n2.  **Evolving Analysis Plan:** As a researcher progresses through a study, especially a PhD student like Lena, the analysis plan can evolve. Initial scripts might be more exploratory or include a broader range of data before refining the exact criteria for the final dataset. Supervisor feedback or internal reviews might also lead to refined exclusion criteria.\n\n3.  **Technical Issues:** The case mentions that \"some files are missing due to a hard drive failure.\" Such issues could lead to participants initially included in a dataset later being excluded because their complete data became inaccessible or corrupted. The lab switching software could also necessitate re-evaluation of how data from earlier participants was handled.\n\n4.  **Pilot Data:** Sometimes, initial participants are treated as a pilot phase to test the experiment's robustness, and while they might be included in early analyses, they are later excluded from the main, final analysis to maintain a strict experimental design.\n\nGiven that Lena is presumed *not* to have committed misconduct, the existence of an earlier script with more participants is not an indicator of fraud, but rather a normal consequence of conscientious data processing and refinement. It signifies the iterative nature of data handling, where the dataset is meticulously cleaned and validated before final reporting. Excluding participants for legitimate scientific reasons (e.g., poor data quality, non-compliance) is considered good practice to ensure the integrity and interpretability of the final results.\n\n95"

Here's why:\n\n1.  **Selective Exclusion for Desired Results (P-Hacking/Falsification):** One common method of academic misconduct, particularly when under pressure to achieve \"statistically significant support\" and \"clean results,\" is to selectively exclude participants whose data do not align with the desired hypothesis. If Lena were falsifying data, she might start with a full dataset (either legitimately collected or partially fabricated) and then systematically remove participants whose data points weaken the main effect or introduce noise that reduces statistical significance. This process would result in an earlier script that includes these \"undesirable\" participants, and a final dataset that excludes them, leading to the \"too perfect\" data and desired p-values.\n\n2.  **Covering Tracks/Plausible Deniability:** Even if misconduct is occurring, a researcher might attempt to maintain an appearance of legitimate data handling. Having an earlier script with more participants, from which some were \"legitimately\" excluded (e.g., due to \"outliers,\" \"non-compliance,\" or \"technical issues\" that are convenient pretexts), could be a way to rationalize the final, smaller, and cleaner dataset if questioned. This creates a plausible (but false) narrative for the data cleaning process.\n\n3.  **Iterative Manipulation:** The process of achieving a \"perfect\" dataset might be iterative. An initial attempt at manipulation might involve a broader set of participants, and subsequent refinements (which could involve more stringent, but still selective, exclusion criteria) lead to the final reported dataset. An earlier script would capture one of these intermediate stages.\n\nWhile legitimate reasons for participant exclusion always exist, if misconduct is the premise, then selective exclusion becomes a powerful tool for achieving fabricated or falsified outcomes. The existence of an earlier script with more participants is entirely consistent with this type of manipulation.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct (i.e., she did not intentionally fabricate or falsify data, and her results are genuinely derived from unbiased analyses), it is highly unlikely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost no p-values just above .05.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Statistical Expectation for Genuine Results:** Even if there are true effects, and even if exploratory analyses are conducted, the distribution of p-values from genuinely unbiased analyses should be more continuous. While a strong effect would lead to more p-values clustering closer to 0, there would still be a natural spread, including some p-values that fall just above the arbitrary .05 significance threshold. The likelihood of *many* analyses landing just below .05 and *almost none* landing just above .05 by pure chance is exceedingly low.\n\n2.  **The \"P-Hacking Signature\":** This specific pattern (a \"cliff\" at p=.05) is a known statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or questionable research practices (QRPs). These practices involve making multiple analytical decisions (e.g., stopping data collection when p < .05, selectively reporting analyses, including/excluding covariates, transforming data differently, choosing specific outlier handling methods) until a desired p-value (typically just below .05) is achieved. While these practices might not involve *fabricating raw data*, they lead to \"falsified\" statistical results in the sense that the reported p-values do not accurately reflect the statistical evidence in an unbiased manner. Such results are not \"genuine\" in a statistical sense, even if the raw data itself was not invented.\n\n3.  **Unintentional Errors vs. Systematic Bias:** While unintentional errors can occur, they are unlikely to produce such a systematically biased pattern across multiple analyses. This pattern suggests a systematic process pushing values across the .05 threshold, rather than random or honest mistakes. Even if Lena genuinely believed she was making the \"best\" analytical choices for each exploratory analysis, the cumulative effect leading to this specific, highly improbable distribution would strongly suggest that those choices were influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the pursuit of statistical significance at the .05 level, rather than being purely objective.\n\nTherefore, if Lena is completely free of *any form* of misconduct that would bias the results towards significance (which includes practices like p-hacking that distort the genuine statistical outcome), this pattern would be an extreme statistical anomaly.\n\n5"

While not always outright fabrication, p-hacking is considered a form of academic misconduct as it involves manipulating data analysis or reporting choices to achieve statistical significance. Examples include:\n    *   Running multiple analyses and only reporting those that yield p < .05.\n    *   Stopping data collection once p < .05 is achieved.\n    *   Selectively including or excluding outliers or participants to push a p-value below .05.\n    *   Trying different statistical models, transformations, or covariates until significance is reached.\n\n2.  **Pressure to Publish:** The scenario states Professor Mills is \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This pressure is a significant driver for researchers to engage in p-hacking to generate \"strong, statistically significant support\" and \"clean results,\" which are highly valued in top journals.\n\n3.  **Achieving \"Perfect\" Results:** The anonymous whistleblower's claim that data \"look too perfect\" aligns perfectly with this p-value distribution. A string of results just below the significance threshold, without the natural spread above it, suggests an active process of sculpting the data and analyses to fit the desired narrative of significant findings.\n\n4.  **Covering Intentional Manipulation:** Even if Lena's misconduct involved more direct fabrication, she would likely still want the statistical results to appear plausible, albeit \"perfect.\" Orchestrating p-values to fall just below .05 for multiple analyses is a common way to simulate strong findings.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in academic misconduct, especially driven by the pressure to publish positive results, this pattern of p-values is not just probable, but a highly expected outcome of such behavior.\n\n95"

PhD students are deeply aware of the grant cycle and the importance of their supervisor's funding. They also understand that publishable findings, especially \"strong, statistically significant support\" for a new theory in a \"high-profile experiment,\" are crucial for their own career progression (e.g., securing a postdoc). These are external realities of the system, not indicators of a propensity for misconduct.\n\n2.  **Natural Desire for Success:** Any researcher, honest or otherwise, wants their experiments to \"work\" in the sense that they want to find support for their hypotheses and produce meaningful, publishable results.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is **highly unlikely** that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection, specifically to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Purpose of Preregistration:** Preregistration is a core practice in open science designed specifically to prevent bias and questionable research practices (QRPs) like p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). Its entire point is to lock in analytical plans *before* data collection or analysis, ensuring that the researcher cannot modify criteria based on preliminary results.\n\n2.  **Impact of Changes:**\n    *   **Exclusion Criteria:** Changing exclusion criteria *after* data collection allows a researcher to selectively remove participants whose data might weaken the desired effect or increase noise, thus artificially inflating statistical significance.\n    *   **Primary Outcomes:** Changing primary outcomes *after* data collection allows a researcher to shift focus to measures that happened to yield significant results, discarding or downplaying initial primary outcomes that might have been null.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Violation of Scientific Integrity:** Modifying these critical elements of a preregistration document post-hoc, especially without transparency or clear, documented, and pre-approved justifications for unforeseen circumstances, is a severe breach of scientific integrity. Even if the intent wasn't malicious, the *effect* is to undermine the validity of the reported findings by making it appear that the confirmatory analyses were decided *before* seeing the data, when in fact they were not.\n\n4.  **\"Not Misconduct\" Implication:** If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies she is operating with scientific integrity. An honest researcher would understand the grave implications of such post-hoc changes to a preregistration. While minor, non-outcome-influencing clarifications might occur, altering *exclusion criteria* and *primary outcomes* is a direct pathway to biased results and is virtually indistinguishable from p-hacking or HARKing, which are forms of misconduct.\n\nThe only extremely rare and transparent exceptions might be if a catastrophic, unforeseen methodological flaw rendered the original preregistration completely unworkable, necessitating a *new* preregistration or an extremely public and justified deviation. However, the scenario describes a modification discovered via \"file timestamps,\" implying a less transparent process.\n\nGiven the serious implications for research validity, an honest researcher would avoid such an action or, if absolutely unavoidable, would declare it as a significant deviation and treat any resulting findings as exploratory rather than confirmatory.\n\n5"

These are forms of academic misconduct.\n    *   **Changing Exclusion Criteria:** If Lena collected data and found that certain participants' results were weakening the desired effect or introducing noise, she could strategically modify exclusion criteria to remove those participants, thereby \"cleaning\" the data and pushing p-values below the .05 threshold.\n    *   **Changing Primary Outcomes:** If the originally specified primary outcome did not yield significant results, but an exploratory analysis on a different measure did, Lena could modify the preregistration to re-designate this successful outcome as the \"primary\" one. This would allow her to report a significant finding where her original, pre-specified test might have been null.\n\n2.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The context provided – Lena's supervisor being \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" Lena needing \"this one to work\" to secure a postdoc, and the whistleblower claiming data \"look too perfect\" – strongly suggests a powerful motivation to achieve positive, significant results. Post-hoc changes to a preregistration are a highly effective, albeit unethical, way to achieve such outcomes when the raw data might not naturally support them.\n\n3.  **Creating a False Narrative of Rigor:** Even if the underlying intent is misconduct, modifying the preregistration (especially if the changes are not openly declared and justified as post-hoc deviations) can be an attempt to create a superficial appearance of rigor and adherence to open science principles. It can serve as a deceptive \"paper trail\" to legitimize decisions made *after* seeing the data.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in misconduct aimed at securing \"publishable findings\" and \"statistically significant support,\" then modifying the preregistration document in this manner would be a direct and highly probable strategy to achieve those illicit goals.\n\n98"

It indicates that the decision to exclude these participants was made during the initial data processing and cleaning phase, *before* the pressure of publication or reviewer comments could potentially influence such decisions.

Excluding participants who clearly failed to engage with the task (fell asleep, didn't understand instructions) is a universally accepted and expected part of data cleaning. Failing to exclude such participants would itself be a red flag for poor research practice, whether or not other misconduct occurred.\n\n2.  **Focus of Misconduct:** Academic misconduct often involves subtle manipulations (like p-hacking, selective reporting, or strategically altering exclusion criteria for borderline cases) rather than outright ignoring blatant data quality issues. Excluding participants with clear, undeniable issues like falling asleep is a \"low-hanging fruit\" for legitimate data cleaning that even a dishonest researcher would perform.\n\n3.  **Enhancing Data \"Perfection\":** Excluding these participants *genuinely* improves data quality by removing noise and irrelevant data. This could, paradoxically, contribute to the \"too perfect\" appearance of the data if Lena were also engaging in *other* more subtle forms of manipulation.\n\nTherefore, the performance of routine, defensible data cleaning (like excluding these two participants with clear notes) does not contradict the possibility of other forms of academic misconduct.

This normalizes her actions completely within the framework of legitimate scientific inquiry.\n\n4.  **Transparency, Not Concealment:** Storing these multiple scripts (rather than deleting them) indicates transparency and a willingness to document the analytical process, which is consistent with honest research.\n\nIn summary, this evidence directly describes a practice of thorough, transparent, and robust data analysis, which is the antithesis of academic misconduct. It indicates careful data handling and a commitment to understanding the stability of results, which is what one would expect from an honest and diligent researcher.\n\n99"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is **highly likely** that the lab's data management logs would still show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Conformity to Lab Norms:** The scenario explicitly states that this is a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" and that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns.\" If this is standard operating procedure in her lab, Lena would likely follow it regardless of whether she intends to commit misconduct. Deviating from established lab practices would be more conspicuous than adhering to them.\n\n2.  **Plausible Deniability and Obscuring Misconduct:** Running and storing multiple scripts, especially some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, can be highly convenient for a researcher engaging in misconduct like p-hacking or selective reporting.\n    *   She could genuinely run these different analyses.\n    *   Then, she could *selectively choose* to report the version of the analysis (and its associated exclusion criteria) that yields the \"best\" or most statistically significant result, while presenting it as the most \"robust\" or \"scientifically sound\" choice.\n    *   The existence of these other scripts provides a plausible explanation for having explored various analytical paths, making it harder to pinpoint specific instances of manipulation if the inquiry were to focus solely on the *existence* of multiple scripts rather than the *selection process* for the final reported results.\n\n3.  **Misconduct Can Be Subtle:** Not all misconduct involves outright fabrication. P-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) are common forms that often involve performing numerous legitimate analyses and then selectively reporting only those that achieve statistical significance. Having a wide array of scripts, some with slightly different parameters, fits perfectly into this strategy.\n\nTherefore, these logs are not necessarily exculpatory in a misconduct scenario. Instead, they represent a context within which selective reporting or other forms of misconduct could easily occur and potentially be hidden.\n\n90"

These are the hallmarks of an honest and competent scientist.\n\n2.  **Consistency with \"No Misconduct\" Premise:** If Lena did not commit academic misconduct in the current study, it suggests a general ethical and methodological uprightness. This established pattern of good practice from her previous work perfectly aligns with and reinforces the idea that she is an honest researcher. It suggests a consistent character and approach to research.\n\n3.  **Reproducibility as a Gold Standard:** \"Reproducible\" is a key standard in modern science, implying that others can re-run the analyses and reach the same conclusions given the raw data and scripts. Achieving this rating in an independent audit is a strong affirmation of robust and transparent research practices, which are antithetical to misconduct.\n\nTherefore, this evidence is highly consistent with Lena being an honest and diligent researcher.\n\n100"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, it is still **highly likely** that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Situational Misconduct:** Academic misconduct is often not a consistent, career-long pattern but can be driven by specific, intense pressures related to a particular project, grant cycle, or career stage. The current scenario highlights significant pressure on Lena and her supervisor. A researcher might typically adhere to high standards but succumb to pressure in a high-stakes situation.\n\n2.  **Maintaining a Facade of Integrity:** A researcher engaged in misconduct might actively work to maintain a strong reputation and demonstrate good practices in other areas or earlier projects. Having a clean record and being lauded for data handling provides a powerful shield against suspicion and makes it harder for others to question their integrity when issues eventually arise. It creates a baseline of trust.\n\n3.  **Nature of the Audit:** The previous audit was conducted \"the year before.\" The scope and depth of audits can vary. While \"well-documented and reproducible\" is excellent, it might assess the consistency of the reported analysis with the raw data and script, rather than scrutinizing the entire universe of *all possible* analyses or searching for evidence of selective reporting (p-hacking) that might be subtly hidden even in reproducible scripts.\n\n4.  **Learning and Evolution of Misconduct:** It's also possible that Lena's misconduct, if it occurred, developed or escalated with this particular high-profile, high-pressure experiment. Her previous work might have genuinely been clean.\n\nTherefore, a good prior record of data handling and successful audits does not preclude misconduct in a later, high-pressure context; it might even be a strategic element of the persona of a researcher who *does* commit misconduct.\n\n90"

If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this pattern is extremely low (5%). If she did commit misconduct, the likelihood is extremely high (95%). This is a very strong indicator.\n2.  **Preregistration Modified Post-Data Collection:** Changing planned exclusion criteria and primary outcomes *after* data collection fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is considered a severe breach of scientific integrity, often indicative of HARKing or p-hacking. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this is extremely low (5%). If she did commit misconduct, the likelihood is extremely high (98%). This is another very strong indicator.\n3.  **Emails as Motivation:** Lena's emails expressing intense pressure and the need for the study to \"work\" provide a clear and compelling motivation for engaging in misconduct. While these feelings are common for honest researchers too, they significantly raise the contextual probability for misconduct when combined with other red flags.\n\n**Evidence Consistent with Both or Less Discriminatory:**\n\n*   **Earlier script with more participants:** This is plausible for both scenarios (normal data cleaning vs. selective exclusion).\n*   **Exclusion of 2 participants (asleep/didn't understand):** This is standard good practice, expected from both honest and dishonest researchers who want to maintain a facade of legitimacy.\n*   **Lab software switch & confirmed hard drive failure:** These are mundane technical issues that could genuinely occur but also provide convenient excuses for missing data if misconduct occurred.\n*   **Multiple alternative analysis scripts for robustness (lab-wide push):** This is good scientific practice but could also be a cover for selective reporting or p-hacking if a dishonest researcher chooses only the most favorable outcome from these explorations.\n\n**Evidence Suggesting Absence of Misconduct (or a strong prior for integrity):**\n\n*   **Lena's prior record:** No prior irregularities, passed an independent data audit, and projects rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\" This establishes a strong baseline of integrity and competence. However, it does not preclude situational misconduct driven by extreme pressure.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe two strongest pieces of evidence – the highly improbable p-value distribution and the post-hoc modification of the preregistration for core analytical decisions (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) – are extremely difficult to reconcile with a scenario where no misconduct occurred. These are specific actions that directly facilitate the manipulation of results to achieve significance and are not easily explained as \"honest mistakes.\"\n\nWhile Lena's prior good record is a powerful counterpoint, the specific nature and confluence of these current red flags strongly suggest a deviation from her usual practices, likely driven by the immense pressure outlined in her emails. The other \"mundane explanations\" could potentially serve as convenient covers for these more severe irregularities.\n\nTherefore, despite her good prior record, the direct evidence of actions (p-hacking signature and preregistration tampering) that are hallmarks of misconduct is overwhelmingly compelling.\n\n85"
