The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The described pattern – an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05 – is a widely recognized statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or \"fishing for significance.\"\n\nThis pattern does not typically occur naturally if statistical analyses are conducted and reported transparently, without selective reporting or adjustments made to achieve significance. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Arbitrary Threshold:** The .05 significance level is an arbitrary convention. If true effects exist and analyses are unbiased, p-values should either be generally small (indicating a strong effect) or distributed relatively smoothly around the threshold (if the null hypothesis is marginally false or true). There is no inherent statistical reason for p-values to \"cluster\" just below .05 and then abruptly disappear just above it.\n2.  **Selective Reporting/Analytical Flexibility:** This pattern strongly suggests that analyses yielding p-values slightly above .05 were either:\n    *   Not reported.\n    *   Modified (e.g., by transforming data, removing outliers, adding covariates, changing statistical models) until their p-value dipped below .05.\n    *   Or, that many analyses were run, and only those that happened to cross the significance threshold were selected for reporting.\n3.  **Exploratory Analyses:** While exploratory analyses allow for more flexibility, the integrity of the findings still relies on reporting all analyses transparently or adjusting for multiple comparisons. An \"unusually high concentration\" of just-significant p-values in exploratory analyses, coupled with a lack of just-non-significant ones, points strongly to selective reporting.\n\nThe inquiry is evaluating whether Lena \"intentionally manipulated or fabricated data... as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional.\"\n\n*   **If results were truly genuine and all errors unintentional, without any form of conscious or unconscious bias, selective reporting, or methodological adjustments aimed at achieving significance:** It is exceedingly unlikely that this specific, highly artificial p-value distribution would spontaneously emerge. It would be a statistical fluke of enormous proportions for several exploratory analyses to coincidentally land just below .05 with no corresponding values just above.\n*   **If Lena engaged in questionable research practices (QRPs) such as p-hacking or selective reporting, even if she claims these were \"unintentional errors\" due to lack of knowledge, pressure, or genuine belief that she was finding the \"true\" signal:** This pattern *would* be expected. While Lena might not perceive these actions as \"intentional fraud,\" such practices are generally considered a form of scientific misconduct because they misrepresent the true statistical evidence. Given the focus on \"intentional manipulation or fabrication,\" there's a fine line here, but the statistical pattern itself is a strong indicator that something beyond \"genuine results\" or \"random error\" occurred.\n\nTherefore, assuming \"not committing academic misconduct\" implies a complete absence of any form of biased analysis or selective reporting (whether Lena considered it intentional or not), the probability of this specific pattern occurring is extremely low. The pattern itself is highly improbable under the assumption of unbiased research practices.\n\n**Probability Judgment:** 5"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, particularly falsification of data or analyses, it is highly likely that the final dataset would exhibit the described pattern of p-values.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **P-hacking and Selective Reporting:** The pattern described – an unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 with very few just above – is the classic statistical signature of \"p-hacking\" or \"fishing for significance\" and selective reporting. These practices fall under the umbrella of academic misconduct (specifically, falsification of results).\n    *   **P-hacking** involves performing multiple statistical tests, transforming data, removing outliers, or adding covariates until a statistically significant result (e.g., p < .05) is achieved. If Lena were engaged in this type of misconduct, she would repeatedly adjust her analyses until the p-value dipped just below the conventional .05 threshold, thus creating exactly this cluster.\n    *   **Selective reporting** entails running many exploratory analyses but only choosing to report those that yield statistically significant results, while discarding or omitting those that do not, especially those that fall just short of significance. This would also lead to the observed pattern.\n\n2.  **Motivation and Pressure:** The scenario describes Lena being under pressure to produce \"publishable findings\" for a major grant review. This context provides a strong motivation for engaging in practices like p-hacking or selective reporting, as these are methods to \"find\" significance when it might not genuinely exist or be robust. It's often perceived as less risky than outright fabrication of data, yet it still constitutes serious misconduct.\n\n3.  **Nature of the Pattern:** This specific pattern is not random. It indicates an intentional or at least non-random process that preferentially selects or manipulates results to achieve significance. If Lena was committing misconduct aimed at producing significant results, this particular pattern is a highly effective way to do so without necessarily fabricating entire datasets with extremely low p-values, which might be more obvious.\n\nWhile academic misconduct could take other forms (e.g., outright fabrication of data leading to extremely low p-values, or plagiarism), if the misconduct involves manipulating the data or analysis process to achieve significance for reporting, then this specific p-value distribution is a very strong and expected outcome. It's a common strategy for individuals under pressure to present \"clean\" and \"significant\" results.\n\nProbability Judgment: 95"

The act of altering a preregistration in such a fundamental way *after* data collection is widely recognized as a severe breach of research integrity and a form of questionable research practice (QRP). If done intentionally to achieve desired results, it directly constitutes academic misconduct by falsifying the planned study design.\n\nWhile one could theoretically imagine an \"honest mistake\" such as:\n*   A profound misunderstanding of preregistration's purpose, leading to retrospective \"updates.\"\n*   A highly unusual clerical error where a later, post-data-collection draft was mistakenly represented as the original preregistration, and the changes were genuinely not intended to bias results.\n\nHowever, these scenarios are extremely improbable given the critical nature of exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. Such changes almost invariably have the effect of making results appear more favorable. For this to occur *without* any intent to manipulate or bias findings (i.e., without misconduct), it would imply a level of ignorance or accidental circumstance that is exceedingly rare in professional research.

It's an attempt to retroactively legitimize analyses or outcomes that were *not* originally planned, making post-hoc decisions appear as a priori commitments. This is a severe breach of research integrity.\n2.  **Covering Up P-hacking/HARKing:** This action is a classic tactic to conceal \"p-hacking\" (selectively analyzing data until a significant result is found) or \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). If Lena analyzed her data, found that her original primary outcome wasn't significant, or that excluding certain participants led to a desired result, she could then modify the preregistration to align with her post-hoc findings. This makes it appear as though these decisions were made transparently and in advance.\n3.  **Motivation for Misconduct:** The context describes Professor Mills being \"under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\" This pressure strongly motivates researchers to achieve significant results, and altering a preregistration is a strategic way to achieve this while maintaining the *appearance* of rigorous, transparent science, especially when a preregistration document already exists.\n4.  **Sophisticated Misconduct:** This form of misconduct is more sophisticated than simple data fabrication because it leverages an existing transparency mechanism (preregistration) to lend false credibility to manipulated findings. It specifically targets the integrity of the research design reporting.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in academic misconduct aimed at securing favorable, publishable results, modifying the preregistration document in this manner is a very logical and effective strategy she might employ.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

Supervisors frequently rely on successful project outcomes to secure funding, and it is entirely plausible for a diligent student to be aware of and feel this external pressure, even if they intend to conduct their research ethically.\n2.  **\"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\"**: This is a widely acknowledged reality in many scientific fields. Publishing positive, novel, and statistically significant results in high-impact journals is often crucial for career progression, including securing competitive postdoctoral positions. A student can honestly hold this belief and feel this personal career pressure without intending to fabricate or falsify data.\n3.  **\"I need this one to work\"**: This expresses a strong desire for the experiment to yield successful and publishable results. This desire is a natural human emotion for someone deeply invested in their research and career. \"Work\" can mean a variety of things: that the experimental design is sound, that the intervention has an effect, or that the hypothesis is supported.

Legitimate reasons for exclusion include:\n    *   Failure to meet inclusion criteria (e.g., age range, specific demographic).\n    *   Poor data quality (e.g., equipment malfunction, excessive noise in physiological data, participant non-compliance with instructions, unusually high error rates on a task).\n    *   Participants withdrawing consent.\n    *   Outliers whose data genuinely skew the overall pattern and are deemed not representative.\n2.  **Iterative Process:** Data analysis is often an iterative process. An initial script might be run on all collected data to get a broad overview, identify potential issues, or check for completeness. Subsequent versions of the script would then incorporate specific, justified exclusion criteria to prepare the dataset for the final, inferential analyses. This naturally leads to earlier scripts having more participants.\n3.  **Refinement of Criteria:** Even with a pre-defined set of exclusion criteria, the application and refinement of these criteria often happen after data collection has begun or is complete. For example, a researcher might realize after viewing initial data that a certain task performance threshold needs to be applied, or that certain behavioral patterns indicate non-engagement.\n\nTherefore, the mere fact that participants were excluded between an earlier and a later script is not, in itself, an indicator of misconduct. It's a common and necessary part of rigorous data preparation. The crucial factor distinguishing legitimate exclusion from misconduct would be the *justification* for these exclusions, their consistency with pre-defined (or transparently modified) protocols, and whether they were performed selectively to achieve desired results. If Lena did not commit misconduct, we assume these exclusions were scientifically sound and justifiable.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

If certain participants' data weaken a desired effect or push a p-value above the significance threshold (e.g., .05), a researcher intending misconduct might choose to exclude them to achieve statistical significance.\n2.  **Iterative Manipulation:** An earlier script might represent an initial, perhaps unbiased, run of the analysis on all available data. Upon seeing these preliminary results, if they weren't significant or were borderline, a researcher engaging in misconduct might then iterate on the exclusion criteria to \"clean up\" the dataset and produce a desired outcome. The final script and dataset would reflect these biased exclusions, leading to a reduced number of participants.\n3.  **Hiding the Manipulation:** Retaining an earlier script with more participants (even if inadvertently through automated backups) while the final reported dataset has fewer is a strong indicator that participant exclusions were made, and potentially made without sufficient justification, or post-hoc, to achieve a specific result.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still reasonably likely that she would exclude two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, and document those exclusions with notes predating journal submission.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Legitimate Scientific Practice:** Excluding participants whose data are clearly compromised (e.g., due to falling asleep, non-compliance, or misunderstanding) is a fundamental and necessary step in maintaining data quality and the validity of research findings. Even a researcher engaged in misconduct might still adhere to these basic principles because including truly \"bad\" data could obscure any (even manipulated) effects they are trying to demonstrate or make the overall dataset appear less credible.\n2.  **Maintaining an Appearance of Rigor:** A researcher engaging in misconduct often seeks to make their work *appear* legitimate and rigorous. Meticulously documenting justified exclusions (especially those that are obvious and verifiable) serves to bolster this appearance of careful scientific practice, potentially diverting suspicion from other, less legitimate manipulations.\n3.  **Strategic Exclusions:** It's possible that even if Lena were engaged in p-hacking or other forms of misconduct, the data from these two participants were genuinely unusable or, worse, detracted from the desired \"significant\" results. In such a case, excluding them would serve both legitimate scientific goals *and* potentially the goal of achieving a specific outcome. Documenting these obvious exclusions strengthens the justification for all exclusions.\n\nTherefore, the presence of these well-justified and well-documented exclusions doesn't inherently contradict the possibility of other forms of misconduct elsewhere in the analysis or reporting process. A researcher capable of misconduct might still perform many aspects of their work correctly, especially when those correct actions are easily defensible or even beneficial to their ultimate (potentially fraudulent) goals.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75"

It helps researchers understand if their results are highly sensitive to specific analytical choices or if they hold up across a range of reasonable decisions. If a lab is actively promoting this as a \"push to explore robustness,\" it directly explains Lena's behavior as following good scientific principles.\n2.  **Transparency and Reproducibility:** Storing multiple scripts, even those representing alternative analytical paths, is excellent practice for transparency and reproducibility. It allows others to understand the analytical decisions made and to potentially replicate the process under different assumptions.\n3.  **Lab-wide Culture:** The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns reinforces that this is a standard operating procedure and a cultural norm within that specific research environment. It indicates that Lena's actions are consistent with the lab's commitment to rigorous and thorough exploration, rather than an isolated or suspicious deviation.\n4.  **Countering P-Hacking:** This practice, when done transparently and reported appropriately, is actually a way to *combat* p-hacking. Instead of blindly searching for significance, it involves systematically testing how different legitimate analytical choices influence the outcome, thereby increasing confidence in truly robust findings.\n\nTherefore, this scenario describes exemplary scientific practice for a researcher committed to integrity.\n\nProbability Judgment: 98"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that the lab's data management logs would still show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **P-Hacking as \"Robustness Exploration\":** A common strategy for p-hacking (a form of academic misconduct) involves systematically trying out different analytical choices until a statistically significant result is found. Varying exclusion criteria is one such common choice. A researcher engaging in p-hacking might generate numerous scripts, each representing a slightly different analysis path. The \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" provides a perfect, legitimate cover for generating and storing these many alternative scripts. Lena could claim she was simply following lab protocol and exploring robustness, while in reality, she was selectively reporting the one that yielded significance.\n2.  **Blending In:** The fact that other students show similar patterns in their scripts makes it even more plausible. If Lena is engaging in misconduct, she would likely try to make her actions appear consistent with accepted lab practices to avoid suspicion. Having multiple scripts, like her peers, would make her data trail seem normal and expected within that lab environment.\n3.  **Hiding the Intent:** The problem with p-hacking is not always the *act* of running multiple analyses (which can be legitimate for robustness), but the *selective reporting* of only the significant ones, or making *post-hoc* decisions appear *a priori*. If Lena were doing this, the numerous scripts would be a direct byproduct of her attempts to find a \"working\" analysis, even if her intent was to mislead about the process.\n\nTherefore, the existence of these numerous scripts, even as part of a lab-wide push for robustness, would be entirely consistent with — and potentially even facilitate — academic misconduct focused on achieving desired statistical outcomes through selective analysis.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

    "content": "The evidence presents a complex picture with both suspicious patterns and \"mundane explanations.\" However, some pieces of evidence are far more diagnostic of misconduct than others.\n\nLet's weigh the key pieces of information:\n\n**Strong Indicators of Academic Misconduct:**\n\n1.  **P-value distribution:** The \"unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05... with almost no p-values just above .05\" is a classic and statistically highly improbable signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this pattern is extremely low (P=5). If she did commit misconduct, this pattern is highly likely (P=95).\n2.  **Retrospective preregistration changes:** Modifying a preregistration document *after* data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a severe breach of research integrity. This action makes it appear that post-hoc decisions were planned a priori. If Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of this is extremely low (P=5). If she did, it's highly likely (P=90).\n\n**Strong Evidence that Could be Interpreted as Exculpatory or Consistent with Good Practice (but not necessarily conclusive against misconduct in *this specific case*):**\n\n1.  **Prior record of good data handling:** Her previous studies passed an independent audit and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\" If she did not commit misconduct, this is highly likely (P=95). If she did commit misconduct in the current study, it's still reasonably likely her past work was ethical (P=70), suggesting this current situation might be an isolated incident driven by specific pressures.\n2.  **Legitimate documented exclusions:** The exclusion of participants for falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission, is excellent scientific practice. If she did not commit misconduct, this is highly likely (P=95). If she did commit misconduct, it's still reasonably likely she would make and document such objectively justifiable exclusions (P=75), as it adds an appearance of rigor.\n3.  **Lab-wide push for robustness/multiple scripts:** Running and storing multiple scripts with varying exclusion criteria for robustness checks is generally good practice and common in labs promoting transparency. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this is extremely likely (P=98). However, if she *were* committing misconduct, this lab culture would also provide a perfect cover for p-hacking; she could generate many analyses and selectively report only the significant ones under the guise of \"robustness exploration\" (P=90 if guilty).\n\n**Evidence Providing Motive/Context (but not direct proof of misconduct):**\n\n1.  **Emails about pressure:** Lena's emails expressing intense pressure to \"save the grant\" and fear of a \"null result\" for her postdoc chances provide a strong motive for misconduct. This is highly likely regardless of whether she committed misconduct (P=90 if innocent, P=95 if guilty), as these pressures are common in academia.\n\n**Neutral/Mundane Explanations:**\n\n1.  **Software switch and hard drive failure:** These are common technical and logistical issues in research. They could explain missing files or inconsistencies in the audit trail but do not directly indicate misconduct. The likelihood of these occurring is similar whether or not misconduct happened (P=75 if innocent, P=70 if guilty).\n2.  **Earlier script with more participants:** It's common for initial scripts to have more participants before final exclusions are applied. While this could be used for p-hacking, it's also a normal part of data cleaning. The likelihood is similar in both scenarios (P=85 if innocent, P=90 if guilty).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two most compelling pieces of evidence are the \"too perfect\" p-value distribution and the retrospective modification of the preregistration document. These actions are highly anomalous for ethical research and are very strong indicators of intentional manipulation or falsification of results/reporting. The low probabilities assigned to these specific events occurring if Lena *did not* commit misconduct (P=5 for each) are extremely impactful.\n\nWhile Lena has a good prior record and some of her actions are consistent with good research practice (e.g., legitimate exclusions), these do not negate the specific highly suspicious patterns in *this* study. Her prior good record could indicate that this is an isolated incident driven by the immense pressure she was under, as reflected in her emails. The lab's \"robustness exploration\" culture, while ostensibly good, would have provided an ideal environment and cover for p-hacking if she were inclined to do so.\n\nGiven the confluence of the highly improbable statistical fingerprint of p-hacking and the documented alteration of the research plan after data collection, the probability of academic misconduct is very high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"
