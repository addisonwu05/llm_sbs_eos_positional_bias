    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold can be a red flag for potential data manipulation, but it's important to consider the context and the underlying statistical mechanisms that might produce such a pattern. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Publication Bias and P-hacking**: Researchers might engage in practices like p-hacking or selective reporting of results to achieve statistical significance. This can lead to an excess of p-values just below .05. However, if Lena is being honest, these practices might also occur unintentionally through a process known as \"researcher degrees of freedom,\" where multiple analyses are conducted, and only those that yield significant results are reported.\n\n2. **Statistical Artifacts**: Sometimes, statistical methods or the nature of the data can produce patterns that look suspicious. For example, if the data are highly correlated or if certain assumptions of the statistical tests are violated, this can lead to an excess of p-values just below .05.\n\n3. **Data Processing and Software Changes**: The recent switch in software and any changes in data processing pipelines can introduce systematic biases that might affect the distribution of p-values. For instance, rounding errors or changes in how p-values are calculated could lead to such a pattern.\n\n4. **Hard Drive Failure and Missing Files**: The loss of data due to a hard drive failure might have led to selective recovery of certain datasets, potentially influencing the final distribution of p-values.\n\n5. **Random Chance**: In some cases, the unusual pattern might simply be due to random chance. While this is less likely, it is not impossible, especially in smaller datasets.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is relatively low but not impossible. \n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability to be around 20.\n\n20"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **P-hacking and Data Manipulation**: One common form of misconduct is \"p-hacking,\" where researchers selectively report or manipulate data to achieve statistical significance. This often involves stopping data collection or analysis at points where p-values fall just below the conventional threshold of .05.\n\n2. **Data Falsification**: If data were fabricated or falsified, researchers might deliberately adjust values to produce p-values that are just significant. This can be done by tweaking data points, excluding outliers, or cherry-picking analyses that yield the desired results.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Researchers might run multiple analyses and only report those that produce significant p-values. This can lead to an excess of p-values just below .05, as the non-significant results are not included in the final dataset.\n\n4. **Pressure to Publish**: The high pressure to produce publishable results, especially in the context of a major grant review, can increase the temptation to engage in such practices. The incentive to achieve significant results can lead to deliberate manipulation of data.\n\n5. **Pattern Consistency**: If Lena did commit misconduct, she might have been consistent in her methods of manipulation, leading to a pattern where p-values are clustered just below the significance threshold.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is quite high.\n\nTaking all these considerations into account, I would estimate the probability to be around 80.\n\n80"

Lena might have included more participants in the initial script to have more data to work with and then selectively excluded certain participants to manipulate the results in favor of the desired outcome.\n\n2. **Hiding Non-Significant Results**: If the initial analyses with all participants did not yield significant results, Lena might have excluded certain participants to make the results appear more significant. This can involve removing participants who did not fit the expected pattern or who had data that contradicted the hypothesis.\n\n3. **Post-Hoc Justifications**: After excluding participants, Lena might have come up with post-hoc justifications for why these participants should be excluded.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software during a project can happen for various legitimate reasons, such as the availability of new features, better support, or institutional changes. It is not uncommon for labs to adapt to new tools to improve the quality and efficiency of their research.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: Hard drive failures are a common occurrence and can happen to anyone, regardless of their ethical standing. The IT department confirming the hardware failure and the subsequent repair is a straightforward and plausible event.\n\n3. **Data Loss**: Data loss due to hardware failure is a known risk in research, and it can lead to the loss of files. Ethical researchers often have backup procedures, but sometimes hardware failures can still result in data loss.\n\n4. **Impact on the Project**: The combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure can create challenges in data management and continuity. However, these are realistic and relatable issues that can affect any researcher, regardless of whether they are engaging in misconduct.\n\n5. **Consistency with Ethical Practices**: The fact that the IT department confirmed the hardware failure and that the lab switched software are documented events. These are consistent with normal research practices and do not inherently suggest misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is quite high.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability to be around 70.\n\n70"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files. However, this scenario is less likely to be used as an excuse for misconduct. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software during a project can happen for legitimate reasons, and it does not inherently suggest misconduct. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have used the switch to justify changes in data handling or analysis, but this alone is not a strong indicator of misconduct.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: Hard drive failures are a common and plausible event, and the IT department confirming the failure and repair is a straightforward and verifiable issue. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might be less likely to report a hardware failure that could be used to explain data inconsistencies, as it could raise more questions.\n\n3. **Data Loss**: Data loss due to a hard drive failure can be a plausible explanation for missing files. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might be more cautious about leaving a trail that could be used to justify data manipulation. She might try to cover up the data loss or create a more controlled story to avoid detection.\n\n4. **Impact on the Project**: The combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure can create challenges in data management, but these are common issues that affect all researchers. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have tried to manage these issues more carefully to avoid raising suspicions.\n\n5. **Consistency with Misconduct**: If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have taken steps to ensure that her actions were not easily traceable. This could include being more careful about data storage and backup procedures, rather than relying on a hard drive failure as an excuse.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is lower but still possible.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability to be around 50.\n\n50"

The high-pressure environment and the specific patterns in the data and preregistration are significant concerns, but the positive history and transparent practices also play a role in mitigating this.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be around 60.\n\n60"
