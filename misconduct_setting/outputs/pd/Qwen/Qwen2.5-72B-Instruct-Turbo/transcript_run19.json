The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious issue that can raise significant concerns about the integrity of the research. However, the likelihood of such modifications being due to benign reasons, rather than intentional misconduct, can depend on several factors:\n\n1. **Software and Technical Issues**: The lab's recent switch in software could have led to compatibility issues or confusion about how to correctly document changes. For example, if the new software automatically updates timestamps or saves changes in a way that is not immediately clear, this could lead to unintentional modifications.\n\n2. **Communication Breakdowns**: Miscommunications between Lena and her supervisor, Professor Mills, might have resulted in unclear instructions or misunderstandings about the preregistration. If changes were discussed verbally or through informal channels, it's possible that these changes were not properly documented at the time.\n\n3. **Iterative Research Process**: Research is often an iterative process, and it's not uncommon for researchers to refine their methods and analyses as they gain more insights from the data. If the initial preregistration was based on preliminary assumptions that needed adjustment, Lena might have made these changes in good faith to improve the study's validity.\n\n4. **Data Cleaning and Quality Control**: Sometimes, data cleaning or quality control processes can reveal issues that necessitate changes in exclusion criteria. For example, if certain data points were found to be outliers or contaminated after initial analysis, Lena might have revised the exclusion criteria to ensure the integrity of the results.\n\n5. **Human Error**: Simple human error, such as accidentally saving an updated version of the document, could also explain the modifications. If Lena was working on multiple documents simultaneously, she might have made changes without realizing the impact on the preregistration.\n\nGiven these possible explanations, while it is concerning that the preregistration was modified after data collection, it is not impossible for such changes to be unintentional. However, the likelihood of this being an honest mistake rather than intentional misconduct is relatively low, given the serious nature of such changes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would estimate the probability that the modifications were unintentional and not a result of academic misconduct to be around **30**.\n\n30"

This type of manipulation is a common form of research misconduct, as it allows the researcher to tailor the study's design and analysis to produce more favorable or significant results.\n\nHere are several reasons why such modifications are likely to occur in the context of intentional misconduct:\n\n1. **Achieving Desired Outcomes**: Modifying the preregistration can help ensure that the study's primary outcomes and exclusion criteria align with the results that support the theory being tested. This can make the findings appear more robust and publishable.\n\n2. **Avoiding Data Exclusion**: Changing exclusion criteria can allow the inclusion or exclusion of specific data points that may be outliers or otherwise affect the results. This can lead to a more favorable outcome.\n\n3. **Responding to Reviewer Comments**: If the initial results were not as strong as desired, Lena might have altered the preregistration to better fit the results after receiving feedback from reviewers, making it seem as though the changes were part of the original plan.\n\n4. **Concealing Methodological Flaws**: Modifying the preregistration can help conceal any methodological issues or flaws that became apparent during data collection and analysis.\n\n5. **Pressure to Publish**: Given the pressure on Professor Mills to produce publishable findings before a major grant review, Lena might have felt compelled to manipulate the data to meet these expectations.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is quite high. \n\nConsidering all these points, I would estimate the probability that the modifications were intentional and part of academic misconduct to be around **80**.\n\n80"

These participants might have been included in the initial analysis but later excluded to ensure the integrity of the results.\n\n2. **Preliminary Analysis**: It is common for researchers to include all participants in preliminary analyses to get an initial sense of the data. After more thorough review, they might exclude certain participants based on predefined exclusion criteria, such as failing to meet specific performance thresholds or dropping out of the study.\n\n3. **Clarification of Inclusion Criteria**: Lena might have refined the inclusion criteria as she gained a better understanding of the data. This could lead to the exclusion of participants who did not meet the updated criteria.\n\n4. **Technical Issues**: Software or data management issues could have resulted in the inclusion of participants in the initial script that were later found to be duplicates or incorrectly recorded. These issues might have been resolved later, leading to their exclusion.\n\n5. **Feedback from Peers or Supervisors**: Lena might have received feedback from her supervisor, Professor Mills, or other peers during the analysis phase.

An unusual concentration just below .05 and a noticeable absence just above .05 is not what you would expect from random chance.\n\n2. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses are often more flexible and can involve multiple tests, which should result in a more dispersed distribution of p-values.

This can include practices like selectively excluding data, conducting multiple analyses, or choosing specific subsets of data to report.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Researchers might selectively report only those analyses that yield p-values just below .05, while omitting or downplaying results with p-values just above .05. This can create an artificial concentration of p-values just below the threshold.\n\n3. **Data Manipulation**: Direct manipulation of data, such as altering or cherry-picking data points, can also result in p-values clustering just below .05.

These participants' data are often considered invalid or contaminated, and excluding them is necessary to maintain the integrity of the study.\n\n2. **Predefined Exclusion Criteria**: It is standard practice to define exclusion criteria in advance, and these criteria often include issues like participants falling asleep or not understanding the instructions. If Lena followed these predefined criteria, it would be natural to exclude these participants based on the notes in the raw data files.\n\n3. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data integrity is crucial for the validity of the study.

This reduces the likelihood that the exclusions were made post hoc to achieve desired results.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes in the raw data files adds a layer of transparency and can be a way to cover up misconduct.

However, if Lena was engaged in misconduct, she might have added these notes after the fact to justify the exclusions.\n\n4. **Intent and Timing**: If Lena's intent was to manipulate the data, she would likely try to make the exclusions appear as legitimate as possible.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible but less likely that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files. Here are several reasons why this is possible but less likely:\n\n1. **Software Switch**: Switching software during a project can be a legitimate reason for changes in analysis methods and data management. However, if Lena was engaged in misconduct, she might use the software switch as a cover to justify changes in her methods or to obscure the true nature of her actions.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a common technical issue and can happen at any time. However, if Lena was engaged in misconduct, the timing of the hard drive failure could be seen as convenient for her to hide or lose specific files that might raise suspicion.\n\n3. **Convenience for Misconduct**: The combination of a software switch and a hard drive failure could provide a convenient explanation for missing or altered files. This could be a way to cover up misconduct by making it difficult to trace the original data and analysis steps.\n\n4. **Risk of Discovery**: While a hard drive failure can explain missing files, it also introduces the risk of discovery. If the missing files are critical and cannot be explained by the failure, it could raise additional questions and suspicion.\n\n5. **Independent Confirmation**: The IT department confirming the hardware failure adds credibility to the event. However, this confirmation is independent of Lena's actions and does not necessarily indicate misconduct.\n\n6. **Plausible Deniability**: Lena might use the software switch and hard drive failure to create plausible deniability, making it harder to prove that she intentionally manipulated the data. However, this strategy is risky and can backfire if inconsistencies are found.\n\nGiven these factors, it is possible but less likely that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files if she did commit academic misconduct.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would estimate the probability of this occurring in the context of academic misconduct to be around **30**.\n\n30"

Here are several reasons why this is plausible:\n\n1. **Consistent Good Practices**: A strong record of well-documented and reproducible data in previous studies suggests that Lena has a consistent approach to data management and analysis. If she has a history of good practices, it is likely that she would continue to follow these practices in her current work.\n\n2. **Independent Verification**: The fact that her earlier projects passed an independent data audit and were rated positively indicates that her data handling and analysis methods have been independently verified and found to be reliable.\n\n3. **Reputation and Trust**: A positive track record in previous studies builds trust and credibility within the scientific community. If Lena has consistently demonstrated good data practices, it is more likely that her current study is also conducted with integrity.\n\n4. **Professional Development**: Researchers often improve their methods over time. If Lena has a history of well-documented and reproducible work, it suggests that she is committed to maintaining high standards in her research.\n\n5. **Lab Environment**: The positive ratings and successful audits of her previous work indicate that the lab environment supports and encourages good data practices. This environment is likely to influence Lena's current work positively.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would estimate the probability of this occurring naturally to be around **95**.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is less likely, but still possible, that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible. Here are several reasons why this is less likely, but still within the realm of possibility:\n\n1. **Consistency in Behavior**: Engaging in misconduct in one study while maintaining a pristine record in previous studies is less consistent than a pattern of consistent behavior. If Lena has a history of good data practices, it suggests that she has generally adhered to high standards.\n\n2. **Independent Verification**: The independent data audit for her previous studies adds a layer of scrutiny. If she was engaging in misconduct, it would be more difficult to maintain a perfect record through multiple audits and projects.\n\n3. **Risk of Discovery**: Conducting misconduct in one study while maintaining a good record in others increases the risk of discovery. Consistent good practices in previous studies make it more suspicious if there are issues in the current study.\n\n4. **Professional Consequences**: The professional and personal consequences of being caught in misconduct are severe. The risk of losing credibility and facing severe penalties might deter her from engaging in misconduct, especially if she has a history of positive evaluations.\n\n5. **Meticulous Practices**: If her previous studies were well-documented and reproducible, it suggests that she has a meticulous approach to research. While it is possible to maintain this approach while engaging in misconduct in one instance, it is less likely.\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where this could still occur:\n\n1. **_isolated Incident**: The current study could be an isolated incident where the pressure to produce significant results was particularly high, leading her to engage in misconduct despite her generally good practices.\n\n2. **Strategic Behavior**: Lena might have strategically maintained good practices in previous studies to build credibility, which she could then leverage to cover up misconduct in the current study.\n\n3. **Gradual Deterioration**: Her commitment to good practices might have gradually deteriorated over time, leading to misconduct in the current study.\n\nGiven these factors, it is less likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did commit academic misconduct, but it is not impossible.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would estimate the probability of this occurring in the context of academic misconduct to be around **30**.\n\n30"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by weighing the various pieces of information and their implications. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Preregistration Document Modification**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly suspicious and could indicate an attempt to align the results with desired outcomes. This is a strong indication of potential misconduct.\n\n2. ** Emails to a Friend**: The emails expressing high pressure and the need for the study to work can be seen as both a motivation for misconduct and a genuine reflection of the high stakes involved. However, they do not definitively prove misconduct.\n\n3. **P-Value Clustering**: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation. This is a red flag for misconduct.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Participants**: The exclusion of participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, based on notes that predate the journal submission, is consistent with good research practices. This suggests that at least some of her data handling was legitimate.\n\n5. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is a common practice and can be seen as a thorough and robust approach. This is less likely to be a sign of misconduct, but it can also be used to cover up such actions.\n\n6. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab's switch to a new software and the confirmed hard drive failure are plausible events that can explain some missing files. While they do not directly indicate misconduct, they can be convenient for covering up such actions.\n\n7. **Previous Record**: Lena's previous studies passing an independent data audit and being rated as well-documented and reproducible suggest a history of good practices. This makes current misconduct less likely but not impossible.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the evidence is mixed but leans towards a higher probability of misconduct due to the particularly strong indicators like the p-value clustering and the modification of the preregistration document. However, the presence of legitimate explanations for some of the other issues (like the participant exclusions and the multiple analysis scripts) introduces some uncertainty.\n\nGiven the balance of the evidence, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be around **70**.\n\n70"
