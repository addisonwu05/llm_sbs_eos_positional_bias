  "Based on the evidence and the analysis provided, I think there is a significant probability that Lena committed academic misconduct. However, the evidence is not definitive, and there are plausible explanations for some of the irregularities that do not necessarily involve misconduct.\n\nGiven the high concentration of p-values just below 0.05, the modification of the preregistration document, and the high stakes expressed in her emails, the likelihood of misconduct is substantial. However, the presence of legitimate explanations for some issues and her strong record of previous good practices introduce a degree of uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, my assessment is:\n\nYes, I think Lena committed academic misconduct, but this conclusion is based on a probability and not absolute certainty.\n\n65"
