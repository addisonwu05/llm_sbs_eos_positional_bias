    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Modifying a preregistration document after data collection is a significant issue in the context of research integrity and transparency. Preregistration is intended to specify the study design, hypotheses, and analysis plan in advance, to prevent researchers from changing the criteria or outcomes based on the results. This helps to ensure the study's findings are not influenced by researcher bias and that the results are credible.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the likelihood of her modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is relatively low. There are a few scenarios where such modifications might occur without malintent:\n\n1. **Correction of Errors**: Lena might have discovered errors in the original preregistration that needed to be corrected. For example, she might have realized that certain exclusion criteria were incorrectly specified or that there was a typo in the primary outcomes.\n\n2. **Software Issues**: The lab's recent switch to new software might have introduced technical issues that required updates to the preregistration document to reflect changes in how data were processed or analyzed.\n\n3. **New Insights or Clarifications**: During the data analysis phase, Lena might have gained new insights that led her to refine the exclusion criteria or outcomes. These changes might have been made with the intention of improving the study's validity, but without the intention of manipulating the results.\n\n4. **Miscommunication or Misunderstandings**: There might have been miscommunication between Lena and her supervisor or other lab members about the exact details of the preregistration. This could lead to changes that were not intended to be fraudulent but were made to align with the actual protocol.\n\nHowever, these explanations are contingent on the changes being minor and justified. Significant changes to exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection, without clear documentation and transparent disclosure, raise serious concerns about the integrity of the research.\n\nGiven the context, the likelihood that Lena modified the preregistration document after data collection for honest reasons, rather than with the intent to manipulate results, is estimated to be **30**.\n\n30"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Improving Fit with Results**: Modifying the preregistration after data collection can be a way to make the study appear more robust and to ensure that the results align with the hypotheses. This is a common form of p-hacking, where researchers change their analysis plan to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Avoiding Pre-specified Criteria**: If the original exclusion criteria or primary outcomes did not yield the desired results, Lena might have been tempted to alter them to exclude participants or outcomes that did not support the theory, thereby improving the statistical significance of the findings.\n\n3. **Responding to Reviewer Comments**: If the paper received initial reviews that suggested changes, Lena might have been pressured to make these changes to increase the chances of publication. Modifying the preregistration to reflect these changes can make it appear as though the study was designed with these specific criteria from the start, even if it was not.\n\n4. **Covering Up Irregularities**: If there were issues with the data collection or analysis that Lena wanted to conceal, changing the preregistration can help to obscure these problems and make the study appear more methodologically sound.\n\n5. **Pressure from Supervisor**: The pressure from Professor Mills to produce publishable findings before a major grant review could have influenced Lena to engage in such practices, either directly or indirectly.\n\nGiven the context and the potential motivations for academic misconduct, the likelihood that Lena modified the preregistration document after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, if she did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **85**.\n\n85"

These sentiments are common in high-pressure academic environments and can be a reflection of the real stress and importance placed on particular research projects. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **High Stakes for the Lab**: It is common for graduate students and postdocs to feel significant pressure from their supervisors, especially when funding and lab reputation are on the line. Lena's supervisor counting on the study to save the grant is a realistic concern that many researchers face.\n\n2. **Career Implications**: The importance of the study to Lena's career prospects, such as her chances of securing a postdoc position, is a genuine and often very real concern for graduate students. The academic job market is highly competitive, and successful research outcomes can significantly impact one's career trajectory.\n\n3. **Personal Motivation**: Lena's statement that she needs the study to work reflects the personal investment and emotional stake that researchers often have in their work. The desire to see a project succeed is a natural part of the research process, even for honest researchers.\n\n4. **Emotional and Professional Stress**: Writing to a friend about these pressures can be a way to vent and seek support. It is common for researchers to express their anxieties and hopes in informal communications, even if they maintain high standards of integrity in their work.\n\n5. **Realistic Concerns**: The pressures described by Lena are not unique to her situation. Many researchers face similar pressures and express these feelings in private communications without it necessarily leading to misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct is estimated to be **75**.\n\n75"

By including more participants in an earlier version and then selectively excluding certain participants in the final dataset, Lena could manipulate the data to achieve statistically significant outcomes.\n\n2. **P-Hacking**: Excluding participants after the data has been analyzed can be a form of p-hacking, where researchers try different exclusion criteria to find a set of data that supports their hypotheses. This can lead to the exclusion of participants whose data do not align with the expected results.\n\n3. **Response to Initial Results**: If the initial analysis with all participants did not yield the desired results, Lena might have reanalyzed the data, excluding certain participants to achieve more favorable outcomes.\n\n4. **Pressure to Succeed**: Given the high stakes mentioned in her emails, Lena might have felt immense pressure to produce significant results. Excluding participants to improve the statistical significance of the findings could be a way to meet these pressures.\n\n5. **Covering Tracks**: By modifying the analysis script to include more participants initially and then excluding certain participants later, Lena might be trying to cover her tracks and make it appear as though the exclusions were part of the planned analysis, rather than post hoc changes.\n\n6. **Reviewer Comments**: If the initial reviews suggested changes, Lena might have been motivated to exclude certain participants to address these comments and improve the paper's chances of acceptance.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **95**.\n\n95"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Statistical Anomaly**: A high concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold is a statistical anomaly that often raises suspicions of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation. In genuine, unmanipulated data, p-values should be uniformly distributed across the range from 0 to 1, and there should be a roughly equal number of p-values just below and just above .05.\n\n2. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to multiple testing issues, which can lead to a higher number of false positives. However, even with multiple testing, the distribution of p-values should be random, not clustered just below .05.\n\n3. **Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: If researchers have multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., choices about data exclusion, outliers, and analysis methods), it can lead to more p-values just below .05. However, this is more indicative of p-hacking rather than random chance.\n\n4. **Publication Bias**: Researchers might be more likely to report and submit studies with p-values just below .05, leading to a bias in the literature. However, this bias is typically observed across multiple studies rather than within a single dataset.\n\n5. **Data Collection and Analysis Integrity**: If the data collection and analysis were conducted with integrity, the p-values should reflect the true statistical significance of the results, without clustering around .05.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **10**.\n\n10"

This pattern is a common indicator of p-hacking or other forms of data manipulation. Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: P-hacking involves manipulating the data or analysis to achieve statistically significant results (p < .05). This can be done by excluding certain participants, choosing specific analysis methods, or running multiple analyses and reporting only those that yield significant results. The goal is often to push p-values just below the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Data Manipulation**: Directly manipulating data points to achieve desired p-values is another form of misconduct. This can involve altering data values, removing outliers selectively, or adding or removing participants to achieve the desired statistical significance.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Researchers who engage in misconduct might selectively report only the analyses that yield p-values just below .05, while omitting or downplaying those that do not. This can create an artificial concentration of p-values just below the significance threshold.\n\n4. **Pressure to Publish**: Given the high stakes described in Lena's emails, the pressure to produce publishable results could motivate her to engage in practices that manipulate the p-values. Publications often favor statistically significant results, leading to a bias towards p-values just below .05.\n\n5. **Reviewer Responses**: If initial reviews suggested that the results needed to be more robust, Lena might have been motivated to manipulate the data to achieve more favorable p-values, particularly those just below .05 to meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance.\n\n6. ** covering Tracks**: By ensuring that p-values are just below .05, Lena might be trying to make the results appear as credible as possible while still achieving the desired outcomes.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **90**.\n\n90"

If Lena had a history of misconduct, it would be less consistent with her positive reputation and the high ratings from the audit.\n\n5. **Isolated Incident**: While it is possible that the current study is an isolated incident, the likelihood of passing a rigorous independent audit with well-documented and reproducible data in previous studies is lower if she had engaged in misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **30**.\n\n30"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission. Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Standard Practice**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or do not understand the instructions is a standard practice in cognitive neuroscience studies to ensure the quality and validity of the data. Such exclusions are typically documented in the raw data files to maintain transparency.\n\n2. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the exclusions were made as part of the initial data processing and not as a post hoc adjustment. This aligns with best practices in data management and integrity.\n\n3. **Data Quality**: Participants who fall asleep or do not understand the instructions are likely to provide unreliable data. Excluding such participants is necessary to maintain the reliability and validity of the study's results.\n\n4. **Consistency with Protocol**: If these exclusions were based on pre-existing notes, it suggests that they were part of a consistent and transparent data management process. This is less likely to be a result of misconduct and more likely to be a legitimate part of the study protocol.\n\n5. **Transparency**: Documenting such exclusions in the raw data files before the submission of the paper is a transparent and ethical practice. It helps to ensure that the data analysis is reproducible and that the results are reliable.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would! be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **90**.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission. However, the likelihood is lower compared to a scenario where she did not commit misconduct. Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that the notes predate the journal submission makes it less likely that the exclusions were made as a result of post hoc manipulation. If the notes were created during the initial data collection and processing, they would be more credible.\n\n2. **Standard Practice**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or do not understand the instructions is a standard practice in research. Even if Lena engaged in misconduct, it is plausible that she followed these standard practices for legitimate reasons.\n\n3. **Covering Tracks**: If Lena did manipulate the data, she might have created these notes to cover her tracks and make the exclusions appear legitimate. However, creating detailed and consistent notes that predate the submission would require careful planning and could be risky.\n\n4. **Consistency with Other Data**: If the notes are consistent with other data management practices and the lab's standard procedures, it is more likely that they are genuine. The presence of these notes could be a way to maintain the appearance of transparency and legitimacy.\n\n5. **Pressure and Stakes**: Given the high pressure and stakes described in Lena's emails, she might have been motivated to ensure that the exclusions appeared legitimate. However, the effort to create pre-dating notes adds complexity to the potential misconduct.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **40**.\n\n40"

Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Preregistration Document Modification**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 30% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 85% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is a significant red flag.\n\n2. **Emails to a Friend**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 75% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 90% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: The emails indicate high pressure and personal stakes, which can be a motivation for misconduct.\n\n3. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 10% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 90% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: The concentration of p-values just below .05 is a strong indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n4. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 85% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 75% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: Running multiple analyses can be a standard practice, but it can also be used to cover up misconduct.\n\n5. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 60% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 50% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: While these events can provide a cover for misconduct, they are also common and can occur independently.\n\n6. **No Prior Record of Data Irregularities**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 90% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 30% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: A strong record of integrity in previous work makes current misconduct less likely.\n\n7. **Exclusion of Participants Based on Pre-existing Notes**:\n   - **If no misconduct**: 90% likelihood\n   - **If misconduct**: 40% likelihood\n   - **Implication**: Legitimate exclusions based on pre-existing notes are a strong indicator of proper data management.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be estimated by considering the weight of each piece of evidence:\n\n- **Preregistration Document**: 85% (high weight)\n- **Emails to a Friend**: 90% (high weight)\n- **p-values Concentration**: 90% (very high weight)\n- **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: 75% (moderate weight)\n- **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**: 50% (moderate weight)\n- **No Prior Record**: 30% (high weight, but positive)\n- **Exclusion of Participants**: 40% (moderate weight)\n\nCombining these probabilities, the overall likelihood that Lena committed academic misconduct is estimated to be **70**.\n\n70"
