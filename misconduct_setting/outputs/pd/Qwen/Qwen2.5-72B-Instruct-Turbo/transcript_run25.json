    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The concentration of p-values just below .05 and the scarcity of p-values just above .05 can be concerning because it can suggest a pattern of p-hacking or selective reporting. However, it's important to consider that such a pattern can also arise due to various legitimate factors, though these are less common.\n\n### Possible Explanations for the Pattern\n\n1. **Statistical Artifacts**:\n   - **Multiple Testing**: If many exploratory analyses were conducted and only those with significant p-values were reported, this could lead to an overrepresentation of p-values just below .05.\n   - **Data Peering**: Repeatedly checking data as the study progresses and stopping data collection once significant results are found can also lead to this pattern.\n\n2. **Analytical Choices**:\n   - **Variable Selection**: Choosing to report certain variables or analyses over others based on significance could skew the distribution of p-values.\n   - **Outlier Removal**: If outliers were removed in a way that disproportionately affected the results, this could also lead to an unusual p-value distribution.\n\n3. **Software and Methodological Factors**:\n   - **New Software**: As mentioned, the lab recently switched software, which could introduce biases or errors in data handling.\n   - **Data Transformation**: Certain transformations or corrections might inadvertently affect p-values, especially if they are applied inconsistently.\n\n### Statistical Considerations\n\n- **P-hacking**: The practice of manipulating data or analysis methods to achieve statistical significance can lead to an excess of p-values just below .05. However, this is a form of misconduct that Lena denies.\n- **Publication Bias**: The tendency to publish significant results more often than non-significant ones can also contribute to this pattern, though this is typically observed across multiple studies rather than within a single dataset.\n\n### Probability Judgment\n\nGiven the multiple possible explanations and the fact that Lena has a strong record of careful data handling, it is possible that the pattern is due to a combination of these factors rather than intentional manipulation. However, the pattern is still statistically unusual and warrants further investigation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **20**.\n\n20"

This pattern is a common hallmark of p-hacking and other forms of data manipulation, where researchers might tweak data or analysis methods to achieve statistical significance.\n\n### Reasons for This Pattern\n\n1. **P-hacking**:\n   - **Manipulating Data**: Intentionally altering data points to ensure they fall just below the significance threshold.\n   - **Selecting Analyses**: Choosing to report only those analyses that yield significant results, often by trying multiple methods or subsets of data.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**:\n   - **Omitting Non-Significant Results**: Not reporting or discarding analyses that yield p-values just above .05.\n   - **Data Trimming**: Removing or adjusting data points to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n3. **Post-Hoc Analysis Changes**:\n   - **Adjusting Analyses After Reviewer Comments**: Making changes to the analysis based on reviewer feedback to ensure significant results, which can sometimes involve unethical practices.\n\n### Statistical Considerations\n\n- **Controlled Studies**: In a scenario where data is fabricated or manipulated, the researcher has control over the final p-values, making it easier to ensure they fall just below the significance threshold.\n- **Consistency with Misconduct**: The pattern of p-values is consistent with known practices of data manipulation and fabrication.\n\n### Probability Judgment\n\nGiven the strong association between such a pattern and academic misconduct, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **80**.\n\n80"

While these events can occur for legitimate reasons, they can also be used to obscure or justify misconduct.\n\n### Reasons for These Events in the Context of Misconduct\n\n1. **Software Switch**:\n   - **Data Manipulation**: Switching to a new software package could be a cover for making changes to the data or analysis methods that are harder to trace.\n   - **New Features**: The new software might offer features that make it easier to manipulate data or produce desired results.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **Data Loss**: A hard drive failure can be a convenient way to \"lose\" files that might reveal inconsistencies or evidence of misconduct.\n   - **Cover-Up**: The failure can be used as an explanation for missing files, making it harder for others to verify the original data and analysis.\n\n3. **Coincidence with Other Actions**:\n   - **Timing**: The timing of the software switch and hard drive failure could coincide with efforts to manipulate the data, providing plausible explanations for any irregularities.\n   - **Documentation**: The IT department confirming the hardware failure adds credibility to the explanation, making it harder to challenge the legitimacy of the data loss.\n\n### Probability Judgment\n\nGiven the potential for these events to be used to cover up misconduct and the fact that they can still occur for legitimate reasons, the probability that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **60**.\n\n60"

There are several reasons why this could occur:\n\n### Reasons for Passing the Audit in the Context of Misconduct\n\n1. **Selective Misconduct**:\n   - **Isolated Incidents**: Lena might have engaged in misconduct only in the current study and not in her previous studies, which would explain why her previous work was well-documented and reproducible.\n   - **Learning Curve**: She might have learned to manipulate data more effectively over time, with earlier studies being conducted without misconduct.\n\n2. **Overlap in Practices**:\n   - **Consistent Methods**: Even if she engaged in misconduct, some of her practices, such as data documentation and reproducibility, might still be strong and consistent.\n   - **Team Effort**: Other team members or collaborators might have contributed to the well-documented and reproducible nature of the earlier studies, which could have passed the audit without her direct involvement in misconduct.\n\n3. **Audit Limitations**:\n   - **Scope of Audit**: The independent data audit might have focused on specific aspects of the data and methods, potentially missing signs of misconduct.\n   - **Time Frame**: The audit might have been conducted before the current project, and the misconduct started after the audit was completed.\n\n### Probability Judgment\n\nGiven the strong evidence of her previous studies being well-documented and reproducible, and the possibility of selective or recent misconduct, the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is estimated to be **40**.\n\n40"

    "content": "To determine the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to consider all the evidence and its implications. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**:\n   - If no misconduct: 20 (Unusual but possible due to multiple testing or other legitimate factors)\n   - If misconduct: 80 (Highly indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting)\n\n2. **Earlier Analysis Script with Additional Participants**:\n   - If no misconduct: 60 (Common in exploratory research, but needs justification)\n   - If misconduct: 90 (Strongly suggests data manipulation)\n\n3. **Modified Preregistration Document**:\n   - If no misconduct: 30 (Can happen due to unforeseen issues or protocol deviations)\n   - If misconduct: 85 (A common method to align results with desired outcomes)\n\n4. **Emails Expressing High Stakes**:\n   - If no misconduct: 70 (Common in academic settings, but can be a motivator for misconduct)\n   - If misconduct: 80 (Strongly suggests high pressure and motivation for misconduct)\n\n5. **Running Multiple Analysis Scripts**:\n   - If no misconduct: 90 (Common practice for robustness checks)\n   - If misconduct: 75 (Can be used to find significant results and mask manipulation)\n\n6. **Excluding Participants Based on Pre-Existing Notes**:\n   - If no misconduct: 90 (Legitimate and common practice)\n   - If misconduct: 70 (Can be a cover for selective exclusion)\n\n7. **Software Switch and Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - If no misconduct: 80 (Common and can happen for legitimate reasons)\n   - If misconduct: 60 (Can be used to obscure or justify misconduct)\n\n8. **No Prior Record of Data Irregularities**:\n   - If no misconduct: 95 (Strong evidence of consistent good practices)\n   - If misconduct: 40 (Possible if misconduct is recent or isolated)\n\n### Synthesis of Evidence\n\n- **Positive Evidence for Misconduct**:\n  - Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (80)\n  - Modified preregistration document (85)\n  - Emails expressing high stakes (80)\n  - Running multiple analysis scripts (75)\n  - Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes (70)\n  - Software switch and hard drive failure (60)\n\n- **Negative Evidence for Misconduct**:\n  - Earlier analysis script with additional participants (60)\n  - No prior record of data irregularities (95)\n\n### Weighted Analysis\n\nConsidering the weights of each piece of evidence, the overall probability of misconduct can be estimated. The unusually high concentration of p-values and the modified preregistration document are particularly strong indicators of potential misconduct. The emails expressing high stakes and the practice of running multiple scripts also add to the likelihood. However, the lack of prior data irregularities and the legitimate explanations for some of the other points reduce the overall probability.\n\n### Final Probability Judgment\n\nGiven the balance of evidence, the probability that Lena committedFonts academic misconduct is estimated to be **65**.\n\n65"
