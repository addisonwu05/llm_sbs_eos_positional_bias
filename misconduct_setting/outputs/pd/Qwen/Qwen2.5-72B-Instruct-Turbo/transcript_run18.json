    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Natural Distribution of P-Values**: In a truly random and unbiased dataset, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 suggests a non-random pattern that is difficult to explain by chance alone.\n2. **P-Hacking**: The pattern of p-values is a known indicator of p-hacking, which involves manipulating data or analysis methods to achieve statistically significant results. This practice can lead to an excess of p-values just below the conventional threshold of .05.\n3. **Data Fiddling**: Adjusting data or excluding participants post hoc to achieve significant results can create such a pattern. This is especially concerning when combined with other red flags, such as modifications to the preregistration document.\n4. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses are more susceptible to this kind of pattern because they often involve multiple tests, increasing the likelihood of finding significant results by chance. However, a clear and consistent pattern of p-values just below .05 is still highly unusual and suspicious.\n\nWhile there are some rare and benign explanations for such a pattern (e.g., a particularly well-powered study or specific characteristics of the data), they are much less likely than the possibility of misconduct, especially given the context of other concerns.\n\nGiven the context and the unusual pattern of p-values, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 if Lena did not commit academic misconduct is around 10%.\n\n10"

Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **High Stakes and Pressure**: Lena's emails indicate high pressure to produce significant results, which can be a motive for misconduct.\n2. **Unusual P-Value Distribution**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or data manipulation.\n3. **Preregistration Modifications**: Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is a serious red flag, suggesting an attempt to align the study's methods with desired results.\n4. **Software and Hardware Issues**: The lab's switch in software and Lena's hard drive failure can provide convenient explanations for data issues, which might be used to cover up misconduct.\n5. **Exclusion of Participants**: Excluding participants based on legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with pre-existing notes is consistent with ethical practice, but the context of other issues raises some doubt.\n6. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts can be a standard practice for robustness checks, but it can also be used for p-hacking.\n7. **Strong Record of Integrity**: Lena's previous studies passing an independent data audit and being rated as well-documented and reproducible suggest a history of ethical research practices.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, with some strong indicators of potential misconduct and some evidence of ethical practices, the overall probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is around 65%.\n\n65"
