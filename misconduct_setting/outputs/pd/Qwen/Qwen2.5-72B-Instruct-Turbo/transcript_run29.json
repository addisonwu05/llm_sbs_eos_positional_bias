The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below the conventional threshold of .05, with very few just above, is a pattern that can be indicative of p-hacking, selective reporting, or other forms of data manipulation. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **P-hacking**: This involves analyzing the data in multiple ways until a desired p-value is achieved, often by excluding data points, changing analysis parameters, or conducting multiple comparisons without correction. This can lead to an artificially high number of p-values just below .05.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: If researchers selectively report only the analyses that yield significant results and omit those that do not, this can also lead to a cluster of p-values just below .05.\n\n3. **Data Fabrication**: Deliberately creating or altering data to produce desired statistical outcomes can result in p-values that are clustered just below the significance threshold.\n\n4. **Random Chance**: While it is possible for random chance to produce such a pattern, it is highly unlikely, especially when the pattern is consistent across multiple analyses.\n\n5. **Software Artifacts**: Switching software or using different versions can sometimes produce artifacts, but it is less likely to consistently produce p-values just below .05 in multiple analyses.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is quite low. However, it is not zero, as there could be rare and unusual circumstances or honest errors that might explain this pattern.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the statistical implications, I would estimate the probability to be 10.\n\n10"

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Software Transition**: Switching software during a project can be a legitimate and common practice, even if it introduces some complexity. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have used the transition as a cover to manipulate data or to obscure the changes she made. The transition could provide an opportunity to alter files or analysis protocols without immediate detection.\n\n2. **Hard Drive Failure**: A confirmed hard drive failure is a plausible and common event, and the IT department's confirmation adds credibility to this issue. However, if Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have used the hard drive failure to her advantage to explain the loss of certain files that could have incriminated her. The failure could be seen as a convenient excuse for missing or altered data.\n\n3. **Missing Files**: Missing files due to a hard drive failure can be a legitimate issue, but if Lena was manipulating data, she might have deliberately deleted or altered files that could reveal her misconduct. The loss of files could make it more difficult to trace her actions and provide a plausible explanation for any inconsistencies.\n\n4. **Convergence of Events**: The coincidence of these events (software switch and hard drive failure) might be leveraged to create a more complex and confusing situation, making it harder for others to piece together the true sequence of events and detect any misconduct.\n\n5. **Intentional vs. Coincidental**: While these events can happen independently and coincidentally, their combination in the context of potential misconduct raises the possibility that they were used as a cover.

The presence of well-documented scripts and data does not entirely rule out the possibility of misconduct, especially if the manipulation is sophisticated.\n\nHowever, the combination of a strong prior record and the high standards set by the independent audit makes it less likely that Lena would have engaged in misconduct while maintaining such a positive record.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if she did commit academic misconduct, is moderate but lower than if she did not engage in misconduct.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the context of potential misconduct, I would estimate the probability to be 50.\n\n50"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Standard Practice**: Excluding participants who fall asleep or do not understand the instructions is a standard practice in cognitive neuroscience and psychological studies. Such participants can introduce noise or bias into the data, reducing the validity of the results.\n\n2. **Data Quality**: Researchers often make notes and decisions about data exclusions during data collection or initial data review. These notes are typically recorded in the raw data files to ensure transparency and to provide a clear rationale for exclusions.\n\n3. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decisions were made during the data collection or initial analysis phase, which is a standard and expected practice. This supports the idea that the exclusions were made based on legitimate criteria rather than post hoc to manipulate results.\n\n4. **Transparency**: Including such notes in the raw data files is a transparent and ethical practice. It helps maintain the integrity of the research and provides a clear trail for others to follow, which is crucial for reproducibility and trust in the research process.\n\n5. ** Ethical Considerations**: Excluding participants for these valid reasons aligns with ethical standards in research. It is a responsible and necessary step to ensure the quality and reliability of the data.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is high.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the standard practices in research, I would estimate the probability to be 80.\n\n80"

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Legitimate Exclusions**: Excluding participants who fell asleep or did not understand the instructions is a legitimate and standard practice in research. If Lena engaged in misconduct, she might have included these exclusions to maintain the appearance of following best practices and to avoid raising suspicion.\n\n2. **Pre-existing Notes**: The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the exclusions were made before the final results were known. This makes it less likely that the exclusions were made post hoc to manipulate the results, but it does not entirely rule out the possibility that she included these notes to cover up other forms of misconduct.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: If Lena was engaged in misconduct, she might have selectively reported these exclusions while potentially omitting or altering other data points that were less favorable. The notes could be a part of a broader strategy to make the data appear more robust and credible.\n\n4. **Pressure to Produce Results**: The high stakes and pressure described in Lena's emails might have motivated her to ensure that any exclusions were documented in a way that would not raise immediate suspicion. Including these notes could be part of a calculated effort to maintain the appearance of transparency.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if Lena engaged in misconduct, she might have still followed some ethical practices to some extent, such as excluding participants who clearly did not meet the study criteria. This could be a way to balance her actions and maintain some level of credibility.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that two participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions would be excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, is moderate but lower than if she did not engage in misconduct.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the context of potential misconduct, I would estimate the probability to be 60.\n\n60"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is a complex assessment that involves weighing multiple pieces of information. Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: Low probability (10%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: High probability (80%)\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document After Data Collection**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: Low probability (20%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: High probability (90%)\n\n3. **Emails Expressing High Stakes and Personal Importance**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: High probability (70%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: Very high probability (90%)\n\n4. **Lab Switched Software and Hard Drive Failure**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: Moderate probability (60%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: Moderate probability (60%)\n\n5. **Running and Storing Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: High probability (80%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: Moderate probability (60%)\n\n6. **No Prior Record of Data Irregularities and Positive Data Audit**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: Very high probability (90%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: Moderate probability (50%)\n\n7. **Exclusions Based on Pre-existing Notes**:\n   - **If No Misconduct**: High probability (80%)\n   - **If Misconduct**: Moderate probability (60%)\n\n### Synthesis:\n- **Strong Indicators of Misconduct**:\n  - Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05.\n  - Modification of the preregistration document after data collection.\n  - Emails expressing high stakes and personal importance.\n\n- **Moderate Indicators**:\n  - Lab switching software and hard drive failure.\n  - Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts.\n  - Exclusions based on pre-existing notes.\n\n- **Strong Indicators of No Misconduct**:\n  - No prior record of data irregularities and positive data audit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile Lena has a strong record of careful data handling and her previous work has been positively audited, the combination of suspicious patterns in the data, modifications to the preregistration document, and the high-stakes environment described in her emails raises significant concerns. These indicators, particularly the unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and the modification of the preregistration document, are strong red flags for potential misconduct.\n\nConsidering all the evidence and the balance of probabilities, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be 70.\n\n70"
