The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still quite plausible that she would write such emails. The pressure in academia to produce significant results, especially for high-stakes projects, is well-known. Lena's statements about the importance of the study to her supervisor's grant and her own career prospects reflect common anxieties and pressures faced by graduate students and early-career researchers. Expressing such concerns does not necessarily indicate an intention to manipulate or fabricate data. It is entirely possible for someone to feel intense pressure and to voice those feelings without engaging in unethical behavior.\n\nHowever, the fact that Lena expressed such pressures could be seen as a potential motivation for misconduct, which is why it is being considered in the inquiry. It is important to note that the existence of pressure and the expression of that pressure do not by themselves prove misconduct, but they can be part of the context in which the allegations are evaluated.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct is fairly high. While it is not certain, it is certainly within the realm of possibility, especially given the high-stakes nature of the research and the common pressures in academia. Therefore, the probability judgment is:\n\n75"

Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Random Distribution**: In a dataset where no manipulation has occurred, p-values should be more randomly distributed around the threshold of .05. An unusually high concentration just below .05 is statistically unusual and suggests some form of selective reporting or data manipulation.\n2. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses, by their nature, are less controlled and more prone to producing a wider range of p-values. If the data are genuine, it is less likely to see such a narrow and specific clustering.\n3. **Statistical Significance Bias**: Researchers are often tempted to manipulate data to achieve statistical significance, especially in high-pressure situations. The absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly suspicious because it suggests a concerted effort to avoid non-significant results.\n4. **Mundane Explanations**: While there can be legitimate reasons for some clustering of p-values (e.g., small sample sizes, specific data characteristics), an unusually high concentration just below .05 with very few above is highly unusual and would require a very specific set of circumstances.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, is:\n\n20"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by considering the various pieces of information and their implications. Here are the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Pressure and Motivation**:\n   - Emails expressing high pressure and the importance of the study to her career and her supervisor’s grant suggest a strong motive for misconduct.\n   - Probability: 85 (if misconduct) vs. 15 (if not misconduct)\n\n2. **Data Patterns**:\n   - Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is highly suspicious and a common sign of p-hacking.\n   - Probability: 90 (if misconduct) vs. 20 (if not misconduct)\n\n3. **Preregistration Document**:\n   - Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag.\n   - Probability: 80 (if misconduct) vs. 30 (if not misconduct)\n\n4. **Participant Exclusions**:\n   - Exclusion of participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes predating the journal submission, is more likely to be legitimate.\n   - Probability: 60 (if misconduct) vs. 85 (if not misconduct)\n\n5. **Previous Record**:\n   - No prior record of data irregularities and positive ratings in previous projects suggest consistent good practices.\n   - Probability: 50 (if misconduct) vs. 90 (if not misconduct)\n\n6. **Software Switch and Hardware Failure**:\n   - Switching software and a confirmed hard drive failure are plausible but can be used to cover misconduct.\n   - Probability: 50 (if misconduct) vs. 70 (if not misconduct)\n\n7. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**:\n   - Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts is a common practice and can be used to mask misconduct.\n   - Probability: 60 (if misconduct) vs. 90 (if not misconduct)\n\nCombining these probabilities, the overall evidence suggests a higher likelihood of misconduct due to the strong motive, suspicious data patterns, and the modification of the preregistration document. However, the positive aspects of her previous record and the plausible explanations for some issues (like the hard drive failure and multiple analysis scripts) provide some balance.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is:\n\n70"
