The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

It is not uncommon for researchers, especially those in early stages of their careers, to feel intense pressure from both personal and professional expectations. The fact that she articulated these pressures to a friend is consistent with the stresses and anxieties faced by many PhD students and early-career researchers. However, expressing such pressures does not necessarily imply that she would commit academic misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still very plausible that she would write such emails. The level of stress and the importance of the study to her career are genuine concerns that many researchers might confide in a trusted friend about. The need for the study to succeed is a common sentiment in high-stakes research environments, and expressing this need does not inherently indicate a propensity to falsify results.\n\nGiven the context, the probability that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct is quite high. Researchers often discuss the significance of their work and the personal implications of success or failure, especially in a supportive and confidential setting like an email to a friend.\n\nProbability Judgment: 75"

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Rationalization and Self-Justification**: People who engage in unethical behavior often rationalize their actions to themselves and others. Lena might have written these emails to justify her actions, both to herself and to her friend, by emphasizing the high stakes and the pressure she was under.\n\n2. **Emotional Stress**: Committing academic misconduct can be incredibly stressful and emotionally taxing. Lena might have confided in her friend to express her anxiety and the immense pressure she felt, which could be a genuine reflection of her emotional state even if she was engaging in misconduct.\n\n3. **Confidence in Her Actions**: If Lena believed that she could get away with the misconduct or that it was a necessary step to achieve her goals, she might feel confident enough to express her desires and pressures to a friend without fear of being caught.\n\n4. **Lack of Immediate Consequences**: At the time of writing the emails, Lena might not have anticipated the scrutiny that would follow. She might have felt that the actions she took were justified and that they would not be discovered, making it less risky to express her concerns and desires.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that someone who commits academic misconduct might be more cautious about documenting their thoughts and pressures, especially in written form. If Lena was aware that her actions were unethical, she might have been more careful about what she wrote in emails.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena would write such emails if she did commit academic misconduct is still reasonably high, but slightly lower than if she did not commit misconduct, due to the potential for increased caution.\n\nProbability Judgment: 60"

For example, participants might be excluded due to incomplete data, technical issues, or failure to follow the experimental protocol properly.\n\n2. **Preliminary Analysis**: Initial analyses often include all available data to get a broad sense of the results. Researchers might then refine the dataset by excluding outliers or participants who do not meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure the robustness and validity of the final analysis.\n\n3. **Statistical Power and Sample Size**: Researchers might initially include more participants to ensure sufficient statistical power. After preliminary results, they might decide to exclude certain participants to meet the study's specific criteria or to address issues that became apparent during the initial analysis.\n\n4. **Ethical and Methodological Considerations**: Ethical guidelines and methodological standards often require researchers to exclude certain data points. For example, if a participant withdrew consent or if there were concerns about the integrity of the data, these participants would be excluded from the final analysis.\n\nGiven these reasons, it is quite likely that an earlier analysis script would include more participants who were later excluded from the final dataset, even if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80"

Here are several reasons why this could occur:\n\n1. **Manipulating Results**: Lena might have initially included more participants to have a broader dataset. Later, she could have selectively excluded participants to manipulate the results in favor of her hypothesis, ensuring that the findings were statistically significant and aligned with the expected outcomes.\n\n2. **Hiding Irregularities**: Excluding certain participants could be a way to hide irregularities or inconsistencies in the data. By removing participants who did not fit the desired pattern, Lena might have aimed to make the results appear more valid and reproducible.\n\n3. **Responding to Reviewer Comments**: After receiving comments from reviewers, Lena might have felt pressure to make the data look more convincing. Excluding certain participants could be a strategic move to address these comments and improve the robustness of the findings.\n\n4. **Covering Tracks**: Lena might have created earlier versions of the analysis script with more participants to provide a trail that could be used to justify the final dataset. This could be a way to create a semblance of transparency and to have a plausible explanation for the final exclusions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these actions are consistent with academic misconduct, they are also more cautious and deliberately misleading.

Here’s why:\n\n1. **Statistical Significance Threshold**: The p-value of .05 is a common threshold for statistical significance. Researchers often report results that are just below this threshold because they are considered significant. However, in a genuinely random dataset, p-values should be uniformly distributed around the significance threshold. An unusually high concentration just below .05 and very few just above .05 is statistically uncommon and suggests potential bias or manipulation.\n\n2. **Publication Bias**: There is a known publication bias in scientific literature, where studies with significant results are more likely to be published. However, this bias typically affects the overall distribution of published p-values, not the internal distribution within a single dataset. If the dataset is genuine, the distribution of p-values should be more random.\n\n3. **Exploratory Analyses**: Exploratory analyses often involve multiple tests, which can lead to a range of p-values. If the data are genuine, the p-values should reflect the true underlying variability, not a cluster just below the significance threshold.\n\n4. **Random Variation**: While some clustering of p-values is possible due to random variation, an unusually high concentration just below .05 is unlikely to occur by chance alone. This pattern is more likely to be the result of systematic bias or manipulation.\n\nGiven these points, it is relatively unlikely that a final dataset would show such a pattern if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30"

Here’s why:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: One common form of academic misconduct is p-hacking, which involves manipulating the data or analysis to achieve statistically significant results. This can include excluding certain participants, selecting specific analysis methods, or running multiple analyses until significant results are obtained. P-hacking often results in a higher concentration of p-values just below the significance threshold.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Lena might have selectively reported only those analyses or data points that yielded p-values just below .05, while omitting those that were just above .05. This would create a skewed distribution of p-values in the final dataset.\n\n3. **Data Falsification**: If Lena fabricated or altered data, she might have done so in a way that ensures the p-values fall just below the significance threshold. This could involve slight adjustments to the data or analysis to push borderline results into the significant range.\n\n4. **Strategic Exclusions**: Lena might have excluded participants or data points that would have pushed p-values above .05, thereby ensuring that the final results appear significant. This strategic exclusion can lead to an unnatural concentration of p-values just below .05.\n\n5. **Responding to Pressure**: Given the high stakes and pressure from her supervisor and the grant review, Lena might have felt compelled to manipulate the data to meet these expectations.

Researchers often face such challenges and must adapt their workflows accordingly.\n\nGiven these points, it is quite likely that the lab switching software and Lena experiencing a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 80"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the likelihood that the lab would switch software during the project and that Lena’s laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, is still relatively high. Here’s why:\n\n1. **Software Transition**: Switching software packages can be a legitimate and common occurrence in research, often driven by factors such as updates, new features, or institutional changes. This transition does not inherently suggest misconduct and can provide a plausible explanation for any changes in data handling or analysis methods.\n\n2. **Hardware Failure**: Hard drive failures are a common and well-documented issue in computing. The confirmation from the IT department that a hardware failure was reported and repaired adds a layer of credibility to this event. Such failures can lead to the loss of files, which is a realistic and unfortunate but common occurrence.\n\n3. **Cover for Misconduct**: A hard drive failure can serve as a convenient cover for data manipulation or loss. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, she might have exploited the hard drive failure to explain the absence of certain files or inconsistencies in the data. This can help create a plausible explanation for any missing or altered data.\n\n4. **Independent Events**: While the switch in software and the hard drive failure are independent events, they can provide a context in which Lena could more easily hide or justify any misconduct. The transition to new software can introduce changes in data handling that might be used to obscure manipulations, and the hard drive failure can be used to explain the loss of incriminating files.\n\n5. **Adaptation to Challenges**: Even if Lena was engaged in misconduct, she would still need to adapt to the challenges of the software switch and the hard drive failure. These events could be part of the normal research process, and she might have used them to her advantage to maintain the appearance of ethical research practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is quite likely that the lab switching software and Lena experiencing a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files, would occur if Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"

Here’s a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of P-Values**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, which is statistically unusual and suggests potential manipulation or bias.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, which is a red flag for potential misconduct.\n\n3. ** Emails to a Friend**: Lena’s emails to a friend express high pressure and personal stakes, which could motivate someone to engage in misconduct, though they do not prove it.\n\n4. **Alternative Analysis Scripts**: Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts is a common practice, but it can also serve as a cover for manipulating results. The fact that she and other students do this is less indicative of misconduct on its own.\n\n5. **Software Transition and Hardware Failure**: The lab switching software and Lena’s hard drive failure are plausible and common events, but they can also be used to obscure or explain away misconduct.\n\n6. **Previous Record and Data Audit**: Lena’s previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as well-documented and reproducible. This is a strong point in her favor, suggesting she has a history of ethical research practices.\n\nGiven these points, the combination of the unusually high concentration of p-values, the modification of the preregistration document, and the emails expressing high pressure, together with the plausible but not conclusive nature of the alternative scripts and hardware failure, suggests a significant but not overwhelming probability of misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 65"

These factors, while not conclusive on their own, collectively suggest a higher probability of misconduct."
