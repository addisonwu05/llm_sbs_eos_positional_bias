    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is a red flag often referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"p-value manipulation.\" This pattern can occur due to various reasons, including the intentional manipulation of data or analyses to achieve statistical significance. However, it's also possible for such a pattern to occur by chance, especially in exploratory analyses where multiple comparisons are made. \n\nTo assess the likelihood of this pattern occurring by chance without any academic misconduct, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Multiple Comparisons**: When conducting multiple exploratory analyses, the probability of obtaining a p-value just below .05 by chance increases. However, the distribution of p-values should generally be more uniform across the range.\n\n2. **Sample Size and Power**: The size of the dataset and the power of the tests can influence the distribution of p-values. In a well-powered study, you might expect more p-values to be significant, but they should not be disproportionately clustered just below .05.\n\n3. **Data Handling and Software**: Changes in software or data handling methods can introduce biases, but they typically do not create such a specific and skewed distribution of p-values.\n\n4. **Random Fluctuations**: While it is possible for random fluctuations to produce a cluster of p-values just below .05, the probability of this happening by chance is relatively low, especially if the pattern is consistent across multiple analyses.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 would occur by chance without any academic misconduct is low. However, without evidence of intentional manipulation, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. \n\nBased on the available information and the nature of the concern, I would estimate the probability that this pattern occurred by chance to be around **10**.\n\n10"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Consistent Practice**: Researchers who are diligent and ethical in their current work are likely to have been consistent in their practices in previous studies. If Lena's earlier projects were well-documented and reproducible, it suggests a pattern of good research practices.\n\n2. **Passing Audits**: An independent data audit that rated her raw data and scripts as \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates that she followed best practices in data management and analysis. This is a strong indicator of her commitment to research integrity.\n\n3. **No Prior Irregularities**: The absence of any prior record of data irregularities in previous studies further supports the likelihood that she maintained high standards in her work. It is unusual for a researcher with a clean record to suddenly engage in misconduct.\n\n4. **Reputation and Training**: A researcher with a history of passing audits and being rated highly is likely to have received good training and to have a strong reputation for ethical research. This reputation is typically built over time and is hard to establish if there were underlying issues.\n\n5. **Lab Environment**: Being part of a lab that values transparency and rigor, as evidenced by the independent audit, suggests that Lena was influenced by a culture of high standards. This environment is likely to reinforce good practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if she did not commit academic misconduct, is very high.\n\nBased on the available information and the nature of the concern, I would estimate the probability of this scenario to be around **90**.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible but less likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. **Established Reputation**: If Lena had a history of academic misconduct, it would be more difficult to maintain a consistent record of well-documented and reproducible studies. Maintaining such a record over multiple projects would require sustained effort and a high level of skill in covering up misconduct.\n\n2. **Independent Audit**: An independent data audit is designed to detect inconsistencies and irregularities. If Lena's previous studies were rated highly, it suggests that the audit did not find any significant issues, which is less likely if she was engaging in misconduct.\n\n3. **No Prior Irregularities**: The absence of any prior record of data irregularities in previous studies makes it less likely that she was consistently engaging in misconduct. It is unusual for a researcher with a clean record to suddenly start committing academic misconduct.\n\n4. **Consistency in Practices**: If Lena was manipulating data, she might have had to be extremely careful to avoid detection, which would be challenging to maintain over multiple studies. Consistency in well-documented and reproducible practices in previous projects suggests a genuine commitment to research integrity.\n\n5. **Lab Environment**: Being part of a lab that values transparency and rigor, as evidenced by the independent audit, suggests that Lena was influenced by a culture of high standards. It is less likely that she would engage in misconduct in such an environment.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible, if she did commit academic misconduct, is moderate but lower than if she did not.\n\nBased on the available information and the nature of the concern, I would estimate the probability of this scenario to be around **40**.\n\n40"

Here is a summary of the key points and their implications:\n\n1. **Unusual Concentration of p-values**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, which is a red flag for potential p-hacking or data manipulation.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: High (80)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: Low (10)\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, changing some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: High (80)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: Low (20)\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: Two participants were excluded based on notes that predate the journal submission.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: Moderate (40)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: Moderate (80)\n\n4. **Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**: The lab switched software and Lena’s laptop suffered a confirmed hard drive failure, leading to some missing files.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: Moderate (60)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: Moderate (50)\n\n5. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**: Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, similar to other students in the lab.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: Moderate (60)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: High (90)\n\n6. **No Prior Record of Irregularities**: Lena has no prior record of data irregularities, and her previous studies passed an independent data audit.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: Low (40)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: High (90)\n\n7. **Pressures and Motivations**: Lena expressed significant pressure and personal stakes in the success of the study.\n   - **Evidence for Misconduct**: High (80)\n   - **Evidence against Misconduct**: Moderate (70)\n\nConsidering all these factors, the weight of the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of misconduct, but the presence of some mitigating factors (such as her previous good record and the standard practice of running multiple scripts) reduces the certainty.\n\nBased on the available information and the nature of the concern, I would estimate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct to be around **60**.\n\n60"
