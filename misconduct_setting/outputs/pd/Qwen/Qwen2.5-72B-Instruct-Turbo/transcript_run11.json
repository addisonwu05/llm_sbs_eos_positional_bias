    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 in Lena's dataset raises significant concerns, as it is a pattern that is often associated with p-hacking or selective reporting. P-hacking involves manipulating data or analysis methods to achieve statistically significant results, even when the true effect is not significant. This can include, for example, excluding outliers selectively, running multiple analyses and only reporting those that are significant, or adjusting the analysis plan post hoc to achieve p-values just under the conventional threshold of .05.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that such a pattern can also arise due to other reasons, such as:\n\n1. **Multiple Testing**: If multiple analyses were conducted, the probability of some results being just below .05 increases. This is particularly relevant if the study involved exploratory analyses where the hypotheses were not strictly pre-registered.\n\n2. **Pre-Registration and Analysis Plan**: If the study was not pre-registered, there is more flexibility in how analyses are conducted, which can lead to such patterns even without intentional manipulation.\n\n3. **Data Characteristics**: Some datasets have inherent properties that can lead to a higher concentration of p-values just below .05, especially if the effect sizes are small and the sample size is moderate.\n\n4. **Random Chance**: While less likely, it is still possible for random chance to produce such a pattern, especially in exploratory research where the number of analyses is not strictly controlled.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the likelihood of the dataset showing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is relatively low. However, it is not impossible. Considering the various factors that could contribute to this pattern, the probability is estimated to be around 20%.\n\n20"

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: Intentional manipulation of data or analysis methods to achieve p-values just below .05 is a form of p-hacking. This could involve excluding certain participants, adjusting analysis parameters, or running multiple analyses and only reporting those with significant results.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Choosing to report only the analyses that yield significant results and omitting those that do not can also lead to a concentration of p-values just below .05.\n\n3. **Data Falsification**: Directly altering data points to ensure that p-values fall just below the significance threshold is another form of misconduct that could result in this pattern.\n\n4. **Adjusting Outliers**: Selectively removing or modifying outlier data points to achieve desired p-values can also contribute to this pattern.\n\nGiven these factors, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, the probability that the dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is quite high. \n\n90"

    "content": "Based on the given evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct can be assessed by considering the cumulative weight of the various pieces of information:\n\n1. **Unusually High Concentration of p-values Just Below .05**: This is a strong indicator of potential p-hacking or data manipulation.\n2. **Modification of Preregistration Document**: Changing the preregistration after data collection is a serious red flag and strongly suggests misconduct.\n3. **Earlier Analysis Script with Additional Participants**: The presence of an earlier script with more participants and subsequent exclusions raises concerns about selective reporting.\n4. **Emails Expressing High Stakes**: While not definitive, these emails indicate a high level of pressure and motivation to achieve significant results, which can drive misconduct.\n5. **Switching Software and Hard Drive Failure**: These events can be legitimate, but they can also serve as convenient excuses for data irregularities.\n6. **Multiple Alternative Analysis Scripts**: While this can be a normal part of robustness checks, it can also be used to justify or cover up misconduct.\n7. **Exclusion of Participants Based on Pre-Existing Notes**: This provides a legitimate reason for exclusions, which reduces the likelihood of misconduct.\n\nConsidering all these factors:\n\n- The unusually high concentration of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document are particularly strong indicators of potential misconduct.\n- The emails expressing high stakes and the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts add to the suspicion.\n- The legitimate reasons for the hard drive failure and the exclusion of participants provide some balance, but do not fully mitigate the concerns raised by the other factors.\n\nGiven the cumulative evidence, the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is estimated to be around 60%.\n\n60"
