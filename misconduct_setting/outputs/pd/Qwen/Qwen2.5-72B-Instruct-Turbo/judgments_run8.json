  "Based on the evidence provided and the analysis, I think there is a significant risk that Lena committed academic misconduct. The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the pressure indicated in her emails are particularly concerning. However, there are also plausible explanations for some of the other irregularities, and her previous positive record adds some uncertainty.\n\nGiven the balance of the evidence, I believe that Lena likely committed academic misconduct.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
