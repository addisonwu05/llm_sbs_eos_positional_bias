The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The situation Lena is in raises concerns about \"p-hacking,\" a term used to describe the practice of manipulating data analysis until finding statistically significant results. Typically, in a field where the null hypothesis is often true, we expect p-values to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 for non-significant results. However, a spike in p-values just below .05 suggests that various strategies might have been employed to push p-values across the statistical significance threshold.\n\nHere are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Probability of False Positives**: With multiple comparisons, there is a higher chance of obtaining a p-value just below .05 randomly. However, the distribution should still be more uniform, rather than having a cluster just below .05.\n\n2. **Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: This term refers to the various choices researchers make in data analysis, such as which variables to include, which interactions to test, and how to handle missing data. These choices can lead to p-hacking and a skewed distribution of p-values.\n\n3. **Lab Practices**: The switch in software and data loss might explain some peculiarities in the dataset. Similarly, Lena's strong history of careful data management suggests that honest errors or unintended biases could also explain the observed pattern.\n\n4. **Exploratory Analyses**: Often in exploratory analyses, researchers may try many different models and approaches without pre-registration. This can lead to more \"cherry-picking\" of significant results.\n\n5. **Pressure to Publish**: There may be an implicit incentive in the lab to deliver significant findings due to the pressure of a major grant review. This might contribute to subtle biases in the analysis process, even without overt misconduct.\n\nWhile unusual, it's not impossible for honest practices combined with the factors above to produce the observed distribution of p-values. However, it reduces the likelihood compared to a more uniform distribution across the significance threshold.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of observing such an unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 is lower than if some form of p-hacking or data manipulation occurred. However, it is still not zero, as contextual factors provide plausible explanations.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 20"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, specifically through p-hacking or data manipulation, the probability of observing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 would be quite high. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. **P-Hacking**: This involves selectively reporting results or manipulating data to achieve statistically significant findings. If Lena engaged in this practice, it would likely result in many p-values clustering just below the .05 threshold, as this is often the goal when trying to reach significance.\n\n2. **Intentional Data Manipulation**: If data were fabricated or altered to support the hypothesis, Lena might have manipulated the results deliberately to show statistical significance, which would explain the unusual distribution of p-values.\n\n3. **Selective Reporting**: Reporting only those analyses that yield significant results (and disregarding those that don't) can lead to this pattern. This practice is more likely if misconduct occurred.\n\n4. **Motivation and Pressure**: The external pressure to produce publishable results and the internal motivation to obtain favorable outcomes might have influenced Lena to adjust her analyses or selectively report results, resulting in a skewed p-value distribution.\n\n5. **Software and Techniques**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, the tools and methods she used (like particular statistical software or data cleaning techniques) could be strategically applied to produce p-values in the desired range.\n\nOverall, if misconduct was involved, it is very likely that the observed distribution of p-values would result, as it aligns with behaviors known to produce such distributions.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 85"

Preregistration is intended to prevent data dredging and p-hacking by specifying the research plan before seeing the data. However, there can be legitimate reasons for modifying a preregistration document:\n\n1. **Honest Mistakes**: Lena may have realized post-collection that there were errors in the original preregistration or that certain aspects were not clearly defined, and attempted to correct these retrospectively. However, such changes would typically be clearly documented and justified.\n\n2. **Clarifications**: In some cases, changes might be necessary to clarify ambiguous criteria in light of practical issues that arise during data collection.\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: Lack of clear communication or misunderstanding about the state of the data or the research process could lead to inadvertent modifications.\n\n4. **Software and Documentation**: As the lab switched software, coordination issues could have led to late modifications without ill intent.\n\nDespite these possibilities, modifying preregistration retrospectively—particularly concerning exclusion criteria and primary outcomes—is generally discouraged precisely because it undermines the trustworthiness of the reported results. Researchers are encouraged to report deviations transparently and justify them without modifying the initial document.\n\nGiven the importance of preregistration in maintaining research integrity, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's unlikely but not impossible that these changes were made post hoc for benign reasons.

Well-documented datasets can still originate from projects with underlying issues not detected during routine audits.\n\n4. **Reputation**: Lena might have maintained high standards for documenting and managing data previously, which contributed to a clean audit result, while only recently departing from those practices.\n\n5. **Isolated Incident**: The current misconduct could be a single deviation from a generally ethical research trajectory, meaning past projects remained untouched and well-composed under prior adherence to norms.\n\nGiven these factors, while it remains feasible for misconduct not to affect prior audits, it introduces some level of doubt regarding consistent practices across all projects.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 70"

Taking everything into account suggests a moderate, but not overwhelming, probability of misconduct.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 55"

The described situations contain elements that both suggest and argue against misconduct, with plausible explanations on both sides. In such complex scenarios, a thorough investigation by the relevant academic and ethical bodies would be needed to make a conclusive determination. Therefore, based solely on the information given, I cannot definitively say \"Yes\" or \"No.\""
