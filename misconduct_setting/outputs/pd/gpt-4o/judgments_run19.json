  "Based on the information provided, it's difficult to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The evidence contains both suspicious elements and plausible explanations for non-misconduct scenarios. Therefore, without more conclusive evidence, it isn't possible to firmly state \"Yes\" or \"No.\" However, given the balanced nature of the evidence, it may be prudent for the inquiry to continue to ensure all aspects have been thoroughly examined."
