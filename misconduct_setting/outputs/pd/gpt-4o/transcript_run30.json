The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The likelihood that an earlier analysis script included more participants than the final dataset without suggesting misconduct can depend on several factors:\n\n1. **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:** It's not uncommon for researchers to refine inclusion or exclusion criteria as they gain more insight into the data or consider feedback. Excluding participants can occur if they don't meet the set criteria, if data quality issues are identified, or if confounding variables are recognized. If Lena or Professor Mills refined these criteria during the study, it might explain the difference in participant numbers without implying misconduct.\n\n2. **Preprocessing and Quality Control:** Data preprocessing often requires excluding data due to quality control measures. This can include missing data, failed experimental conditions, participants not following instructions, or technical issues. In such a scenario, the main objective is to ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset.\n\n3. **Software or Data Handling Changes:** The lab's recent switch in software could lead to an oversight or misalignment in how participants were recorded or analyzed. Technical errors might cause some participants to be unintentionally included or excluded at different stages.\n\n4. **Documentation and Communication:** Miscommunication or incomplete documentation could lead to misunderstandings about which participants should be included. If Lena's record shows careful data handling in the past, there's a credible argument for unintentional errors resulting from a change in procedures or external pressures.\n\n5. **Pressure and Context:** The pressure to publish high-profile findings before a grant review could lead to unconscious bias in selecting data. Lena might have felt compelled to show results in the best possible light without intending misconduct.\n\nIn conclusion, several legitimate explanations exist for why an earlier version of the analysis script might include additional participants. However, it's important for the inquiry to thoroughly assess whether these reasons are substantiated by evidence, considering both Lena's usual practices and the context of the project. Given the complexity involved, the likelihood that this situation doesn't involve misconduct, but rather an unintentional process of refinement or error, might cautiously be considered moderate.\n\n70"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, intentionally excluding participants from the final dataset may have been a strategy to manipulate the results to support the desired outcomes. Several considerations might suggest a deliberate exclusion of participants:\n\n1. **Cherry-Picking Data:** Excluding certain participants might enhance the statistical significance or clean up the results, making them more favorable for publication. If participants who did not support the hypothesis were intentionally excluded, it points towards potential data manipulation.\n\n2. **Feedback from Journal Reviewers:** If reviewer comments suggested methodological improvements or noted inconsistencies, Lena might have modified the dataset to better align with expectations or criticisms, particularly under pressure to publish.\n\n3. **Consistency of Revisions:** If multiple revisions or changes to inclusion criteria were made without clear, logged, or scientifically grounded explanations, this could hint at intentional manipulation.\n\n4. **Pressure and Incentives:** Given the urgent need to produce publishable findings before a major grant review, Lena might have felt compelled to ensure results appear significant, potentially resorting to unethical exclusion of discrepant data points.\n\n5. **Anomalies in the Data:** If other signs point to non-random exclusion — such as systematic removal of participants not fitting a desired pattern — it raises suspicions of misconduct.\n\n6. **Typical Indicators of Misconduct:** Suspicious editing patterns, inconsistencies with documented research plans, or any history of similar behavior could increase the likelihood of misconduct.\n\nHowever, ascribing a likelihood to misconduct necessitates caution and would depend heavily on corroborating evidence found during the inquiry. Without direct proof of intentional wrongdoing, asserting likelihood remains speculative and contingent on further evidence analysis, yet, given this context, it's more plausible compared to genuine error.\n\n60"

This can occur when researchers selectively report results or repeatedly test hypotheses until significant results are achieved.

This scenario would be relatively rare without any intentional bias in analysis, yet theoretically possible.\n\n2. **Cumulative Type I Error:** Conducting multiple tests increases the likelihood of finding at least one significant result purely by chance. Even in the absence of misconduct, a series of analyses can naturally yield some p-values close to .05 due to random variation, although typically, a balanced distribution around .05 is more common.\n\n3. **Underlying Effect Size:** If the true effect size of the phenomenon studied is genuinely small, p-values close to .05 might naturally occur in large numbers, particularly if the true underlying effect is repeatedly underestimated.\n\n4. **Statistical Noise and Ambiguities:** Issues such as measurement error, statistical error, or peculiarities in data distribution might influence p-value concentrations.\n\n5. **Methodological Choices:** Specific methodological decisions or adjustments, even when made in good faith and transparently, might unintentionally bias results towards such a p-value pattern.\n\nDespite these possibilities, the situation described raises red flags and is often interpreted as evidence of questionable research practices.

Researchers might intentionally tweak analyses, add or remove variables, or selectively report favorable outcomes to produce significant p-values.\n\n2. **Data Manipulation:** Actively modifying data or excluding certain measurements can drive results toward significant p-values. For instance, Lena might have selectively excluded data points or participants that rendered results non-significant.\n\n3. **False Positive Enhancement:** Conducting numerous exploratory analyses without proper corrections (such as Bonferroni correction) and selectively focusing on those yielding significant results may be a sign of misconduct aimed at emphasizing positive findings.\n\n4. **Submission Pressure:** There is a substantial incentive to present positive findings due to publication pressures, especially in the context of impending grant reviews or high-impact journal submissions.\n\n5. **Methodological Adjustments Post-Hoc:** Adjusting methodological aspects (e.g., data transformation, re-coding of variables) after seeing preliminary data outcomes could also contribute to skewing p-values downward, crossing the significance threshold more often than expected by chance.\n\nWhen misconduct is hypothesized, the described pattern of p-values is quite consistent with known unethical practices.

It is not uncommon for researchers to face significant pressure regarding the outcomes of their studies, especially in highly competitive academic environments. Here's why such emails could occur without misconduct:\n\n1. **Expression of Pressure and Anxiety:** Lena's emails can reflect genuine anxiety and stress about her career prospects and the future of the grant. Academics often face pressure to produce significant results due to publication expectations, career progression considerations, and funding dependencies.\n\n2. **Professional Realities:** Acknowledging the stakes involved, particularly at the end of a study, is commonplace. Researchers often candidly express concerns about how external factors, like obtaining a postdoc or securing funding, hinge on successful study outcomes.\n\n3. **Honest Communication:** The language used in personal communications is often more candid and emotional than formal professional settings. These emails could simply be Lena's way of venting her frustrations and worries to a friend without implying any wrongdoing.\n\n4. **Contextual Misinterpretation:** While these statements could be seen as suggestive under suspicion, they may not directly correlate with unethical behavior. Many researchers voice similar concerns without resorting to unethical practices in their work.\n\n5. **Shared Academic Pressures:** Others in academia often share these pressures, so such expressions could be a common sentiment among peers, contributing to a normalized discussion about career anxieties rather than reflecting actual misconduct.\n\nTherefore, although these emails suggest significant pressure and a strong desire for positive outcomes, they do not necessarily imply that Lena engaged in misconduct.

Such pressure can sometimes drive individuals to engage in unethical practices to manipulate outcomes favorable to their needs.\n\n2. **Direct Incentives:** Lena explicitly mentions the potential negative impact of a null result on her postdoc prospects and the grant's success. Such incentives are common reasons why individuals might resort to manipulating data to ensure significant findings.\n\n3. **Rationalization for Misconduct:** Writing these concerns to a friend could reflect Lena's internal rationalization process. She might internally justify any unethical actions by focusing on the perceived necessity for her career progression and the broader research project's survival.\n\n4. **Emotional and Situational Context:** These emails relay desperation or high emotional investment from Lena in needing the study to \"work.\" Under this context, misconduct could be seen as a means to escape a negative personal or professional fallout.\n\n5. **Potential Justification:** If Lena committed misconduct, these emails might be used to partially justify her actions to herself by emphasizing external pressures and personal stakes, reflecting both guilt and justification.\n\nIn conclusion, if misconduct occurred, such emails might significantly correlate with the pressure factors that prompted unethical behavior.

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, the lab's data management logs showing her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria could still occur. However, it might be viewed differently in the context of potential misconduct:\n\n1. **Selective Reporting:** By running multiple alternative analyses, Lena could be identifying which sets of criteria yield the most favorable results, which might then be selectively reported while ignoring or downplaying less favorable outcomes.\n\n2. **Methodological Manipulation:** This practice can enable misconduct if the primary intent is not to ensure robustness, but to manipulate and find a justification for particular findings by exploring numerous exclusion criteria until a significant result emerges.\n\n3. **Concealment Strategy:** Storing multiple scripts may serve as a preemptive defense against accusations of p-hacking or data manipulation, allowing Lena to argue comprehensive testing and exploration of data robustness.\n\n4. **Lab-Wide Practices:** Even if misconduct occurred, adopting lab-wide practices of exploring alternative analyses does not necessarily stem from Lena's misconduct, though it could indicate an environment where exploratory data analysis is emphasized.\n\n5. **Camouflage of Misconduct:** Within a lab culture promoting such activities for legitimate purposes, misconduct can potentially be camouflaged under the same guise, making it challenging to distinguish between honest exploration and unethical behavior.\n\nWhile multiple alternative analyses align with normal exploratory behaviors in research, they could potentially facilitate misconduct by providing a means to achieve or justify desired outcomes. Nonetheless, such activities may not themselves suggest misconduct without further context.\n\n75"

    "content": "Assessing the probability of Lena committing academic misconduct involves considering all the evidence collectively, both supporting innocence and suggesting potential issues. Here's a summary of the evidence:\n\n1. **Suspicious Data Patterns:** The concentration of p-values just below .05 raises concerns but could be due to intense exploratory analysis and pressure rather than outright misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration:** The late changes to preregistration documents are problematic but could stem from misunderstandings about protocol amendments rather than intent to deceive.\n\n3. **External Pressures:** Emails mention pressures and consequences of a null result, indicating motive but these pressures are common in academia and don't confirm misconduct.\n\n4. **Previous Reliability:** Lena's past record shows no irregularities; her prior work was well-documented, suggesting a history of integrity and methodological rigor.\n\n5. **Data Handling Issues:** Technical difficulties with hard drive and software changes present legitimate explanations for some data issues.\n\n6. **Lab Practices:** Running multiple alternative analyses aligns with lab-wide practices for robustness checks, though it could potentially be abused to achieve favorable outcomes.\n\nConsidering the totality of evidence, while there are elements that could suggest misconduct, there are also robust explanations and circumstances that provide plausible, non-misconduct explanations for the observed issues. Hence, the probability assessment leans toward some potential misconduct due to pressures and data anomalies but acknowledges substantial elements supporting innocence.\n\nOverall, the probability of misconduct, considering all factors, might lie in a moderate range:\n\n60"

The evidence presents plausible arguments for both sides, with significant emphasis on external pressures, potential procedural errors, and her past reliable work record. Therefore, without further definitive evidence, indicating a decisive \"Yes\" or \"No\" would be speculative.\n\nNo definitive conclusion can be reached with the given data."
