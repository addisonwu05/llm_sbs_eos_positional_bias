The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

If Lena had valid reasons for exclusion based on criteria set before data collection, this could explain the differences.\n\n2. **Data Quality Issues**: Upon data review, participants might be excluded due to poor data quality or errors identified in their responses, such as noncompliance with experimental conditions or data collection errors.\n\n3. **Reviewer Feedback**: Sometimes, reviewers suggest performing certain analyses that might require the exclusion of some participants, for instance, due to specific confounding variables or outlier treatment.\n\n4. **Software Changes**: The lab's switch in software might have affected the criteria automatically applied for exclusions or how Lena initially handled and processed the data, leading to discrepancies between versions.\n\n5. **Automation and Refinement**: Early datasets might include all collected data before any data cleaning steps are applied for publication-quality analysis.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it remains plausible that an earlier analysis script had more participants included initially, with certain participants being later excluded based on legitimate methodological, quality-control, or review-driven decisions. However, due caution is necessary to ensure that the exclusion criteria were not applied selectively or post hoc to achieve desirable results.\n\nConsidering the context provided and the potential for legitimate explanations alongside the suspicious nature of data exclusion in misconduct cases, a probability judgment that Lena did not commit misconduct through participant exclusion could reasonably be around 70.\n\n70"

Removing participants with data that contradict the hypothesis can lead to a more favorable outcome.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Exclusion might be part of a pattern of selective reporting, targeting data that aligns with hypotheses while ignoring data that doesn't fit.\n\n3. **Pressure to Publish**: With the lab under pressure to publish before a major grant review, Lena might have altered participant inclusion deliberately to present a \"cleaner\" dataset for publication.\n\n4. **Post hoc Decisions**: In misconduct scenarios, exclusion criteria might be changed or applied arbitrarily after reviewing the data, specifically to alter the results in a desired direction.\n\nIn cases where misconduct is suspected, the discovery of a prior analysis script with more participants can suggest possible actions taken to manipulate the results intentionally. This would be consistent with attempts to fabricate or falsify data by selectively altering which data points are considered valid.\n\nConsidering these dynamics, if academic misconduct occurred, the likelihood that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants, with intentions for exclusion in the final dataset for manipulative purposes, would be fairly high.

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, several scenarios might explain this pattern:\n\n1. **Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: In exploratory analyses, researchers often have flexibility in how they conduct analyses (e.g., which variables to include, modeling techniques, handling of outliers, etc.). Numerous analytical decisions can inadvertently favor p-values just below .05, especially if exploratory analyses are driven by an intense focus on achieving significance.\n\n2. **Confirmation Bias**: Unintentional confirmation bias can lead researchers to explore and report analyses that yield significant results, neglecting or underreporting those that don't. This could skew the p-value distribution if Lena unconsciously favored significant findings.\n\n3. **Multiple Comparisons**: Conducting many exploratory tests increases the possibility of achieving significant results by chance alone. This might lead to clustering around the .05 threshold, although a broad distribution would be more typical unless filtering occurred.\n\n4. **Random Chance**: While less likely, chance occurrences could produce such results, particularly in smaller datasets, though it remains an improbable explanation for a consistent pattern.\n\nThough these factors might contribute, the observed p-value pattern is statistically unlikely without some level of conscious or subconscious manipulation to reach significance. If Lena truly did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern would be unusual and still challenging to account for purely by innocent means.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of observing this specific p-value distribution by chance or standard practice without manipulation is low.

    "content": "To evaluate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, we need to weigh the cumulative evidence presented:\n\n1. **Exclusions and Modifications**: The modification of preregistration documents after data collection and exclusion of participants noted before journal submission can raise red flags. However, valid reasons exist for these actions that do not entail misconduct.\n\n2. **P-Value Distribution**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 is unusual and suggests data manipulation, although it is not definitive proof of misconduct by itself.\n\n3. **Emails Indicating Pressure**: Lena's emails reveal significant pressure, which could motivate misconduct but also represent common academic stress without implying wrongdoing.\n\n4. **Technical and Procedural Errors**: The switch in software and hard drive failures are plausible in research environments and without clear intent, do not directly imply misconduct.\n\n5. **Historical Integrity**: Lena’s track record of passing data audits and maintaining high documentation standards in previous projects suggests a history of integrity, arguing against habitual misconduct.\n\n6. **Exploration of Analyses**: Running multiple analyses for robustness is consistent with normal academic practices and aligns with lab-wide norms.\n\nWeighing these points, the presence of unusual data patterns and pressures might suggest the possibility of misconduct, but much of the available evidence can also support non-misconduct explanations. \n\nThus, while there are some suspicious elements, the evidence is not overwhelmingly definitive of misconduct. \nI would estimate the probability of academic misconduct to be moderate but not high, at around 50.\n\n50"

    "content": "Based on the information provided, it's difficult to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The evidence contains both suspicious elements and plausible explanations for non-misconduct scenarios. Therefore, without more conclusive evidence, it isn't possible to firmly state \"Yes\" or \"No.\" However, given the balanced nature of the evidence, it may be prudent for the inquiry to continue to ensure all aspects have been thoroughly examined."
