  "Based on the evidence provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The information presents a mixture of factors that suggest potential misconduct, as well as legitimate explanations and practices. Determining misconduct typically requires a thorough investigation by relevant authorities or committees who can evaluate all aspects of the case in detail, including context that might not be captured here.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer to whether Lena committed academic misconduct."
