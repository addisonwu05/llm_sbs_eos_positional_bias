The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The occurrence of several p-values just below the threshold of .05 with few just above it can be indicative of a phenomenon known as \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting. This can happen when researchers consciously or unconsciously make decisions—such as stopping data collection when results become statistically significant, deciding which variables to include, or reporting only certain analyses—that nudge results over the significance threshold.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider alternative explanations. One possibility is that this pattern was genuinely coincidental, especially if numerous exploratory analyses were conducted, increasing the chance of some being near the significance threshold by chance alone. Additionally, errors due to data handling changes or software issues could potentially contribute to this pattern.\n\nDespite these possibilities, the particular distribution of p-values just below .05 with few just above is more often associated with questionable research practices or data manipulation rather than random chance, especially in conjunction with other suspicious elements noted during the inquiry. If p-values follow a truly uniform distribution in the absence of effects, we would expect a more even spread around the .05 threshold.\n\nGiven the context you've described, while it's theoretically possible for such a pattern to occur by chance or due to honest mistakes, it is typically considered unlikely without additional supporting evidence explaining the irregularities. The specific details of Lena's case, such as her previous research conduct, the nature and context of the software changes, and the circumstances of the hard drive failure, all need to be carefully weighed to make a definitive judgment.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"
