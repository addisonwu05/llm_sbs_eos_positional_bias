    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "In assessing the likelihood of participants being excluded from the final dataset without academic misconduct, several possibilities should be considered:\n\n1. **Legitimate Exclusion Criteria**: Participants might have been excluded based on predetermined criteria, such as not meeting specific inclusion criteria, failing attention checks, or exhibiting data quality issues (e.g., excessive missing data or non-compliance with the study protocol). Changes in analysis criteria can lead to differences between earlier and final datasets.\n\n2. **Analysis Refinement**: It's common in research for analysis plans to evolve based on data cleaning, feedback, or consultation with advisors and statisticians. Initial analyses often include more participants until exclusion criteria are fully applied. In complex studies, this process leads to subsets of data where particular analyses are deemed valid.\n\n3. **Errors and Corrections**: Honest mistakes can occur during data handling, especially if there are issues like software changes or data loss from hard drive failures. These could lead to changes in participant inclusion until errors are corrected.\n\n4. **Software Transitions**: Switching software can lead to data handling differences, including changes in how exclusions are implemented or recorded.\n\n5. **Miscommunication**: Misunderstandings between team members or documentation errors might also result in discrepancies between participant numbers in different analysis versions.\n\nFor Lena, with a strong record of careful data handling, these explanations are plausible. However, the existence of seemingly \"perfect\" data raises suspicion, putting pressure on a precise delineation between methodological rigor and error vs. misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, while the presence of excluded participants doesn't inherently mean misconduct, it is crucial Lena provides transparency with exclusion criteria and decision-making processes, ideally documented before data analyses commence.\n\nGiven the evidence and the assumption of potential genuine error without intent to deceive, I would judge the probability as follows:\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

This is a common form of misconduct where researchers selectively report data to fit hypotheses or desired results.\n\n2. **P-Hacking**: Excluding participants arbitrarily to drive p-values below the threshold of statistical significance could point towards p-hacking, where the researcher manipulates data to report only significant results while ignoring other criteria for inclusion/exclusion.\n\n3. **Fabrication of Results**: If Lena fabricated data, she might adjust the dataset by excluding real participants to fit a certain narrative or to create a less noisy dataset that produces cleaner results.\n\n4. **Covering Up Irregularities**: Excluding participants might help cover up irregularities or anomalies that could draw scrutiny, especially under pressure to produce publishable outcomes quickly.\n\nIn the context where misconduct is assumed, the existence of excluded participants could be more than coincidental, suggesting intentional selection and exclusion to alter the study's outcomes in Lena's favor.\n\nGiven the context of potential academic misconduct, the likelihood that the exclusion of participants in the final dataset is a result of wrongdoing would be judged higher, as these actions align with common misconduct practices to manipulate research findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

Without misconduct, a natural occurrence of this pattern is statistically improbable for multiple tests.\n\n2. **Multiple Testing and Selective Reporting**: While it may happen due to chance, consistently reporting p-values clustered just below .05 suggests selective reporting or post-hoc analyses typically associated with misconduct or at least very flexible data analysis practices.\n\n3. **Statistical Anomalies**: While statistical anomalies can occur, they are rare across multiple exploratory analyses.

Here's why this pattern is likely in the context of misconduct:\n\n1. **Targeting Statistical Significance**: Researchers engaging in misconduct might intentionally adjust data or analyses to achieve p-values that are just below the .05 threshold, given its conventional significance cutoff.\n\n2. **P-Hacking Practices**: Common forms of misconduct include adjusting parameters, re-running analyses, or selectively reporting tests that yield significant results. This activity often results in p-value distributions clustering just below significance levels.\n\n3. **Desired Outcomes**: Manipulating data to achieve significant p-values supports hypotheses or required outcomes, especially under pressure for publishable results. This aligns with the motivation to alter data when misconduct is present.\n\n4. **Evidence of Manipulation**: A sudden drop-off of p-values above .05, combined with clustering below it, is a red flag in research integrity reviews and typically aligns with behavior motivated by an intent to show significance where it might not genuinely exist.\n\nIn summary, such a pattern strongly aligns with behaviors typically associated with misconduct, as it suggests intentional data manipulation to achieve significant results.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "Given the complexity and mixed nature of the evidence, I cannot definitively state whether Lena committed academic misconduct without further context or investigation. The evidence presents both potential indicators of misconduct and plausible benign explanations. Therefore, a thorough and careful review by individuals directly involved in the investigation, capable of examining all nuances of the situation, would be necessary to reach a conclusive judgment.\n\nHowever, based on the probability assessment, the evidence suggests potential concerns but does not provide certainty of misconduct.\n\nConclusion: **No** (I cannot conclusively determine that Lena committed academic misconduct based solely on the information provided)."
