    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The pattern of p-values in a dataset can be an indicator of various issues in research, including p-hacking or data manipulation. P-hacking, or the practice of trying multiple analyses or procedures until something significant is found, can lead to an excessive number of p-values just below the .05 threshold.\n\nWhen determining how likely it is that such a pattern could arise without misconduct, several factors need consideration:\n\n1. **Multiple Testing**: If multiple exploratory analyses are conducted, it increases the chances that some will fall below .05 simply due to chance. This can cause a clustering of p-values around the significance threshold, though typically you'd see more evenly distributed p-values around both sides of .05.\n\n2. **Research Practices**: Researchers often make subconscious decisions in data analysis that may produce significant results, without realizing the potential for bias. This includes selectively reporting outcomes or analyses that are statistically significant.\n\n3. **Software Changes**: Switching to new software might lead to differences in how p-values are calculated or reported, but it’s less likely to cause a systematic bias toward p-values just below .05 unless there’s a consistent error involved.\n\n4. **Hard Drive Failure and Missing Files**: These incidents might explain missing data or discrepancies but do not typically explain a skewed distribution of p-values.\n\n5. **Lena's Record**: Lena's previous track record for careful data handling suggests she might not intentionally manipulate data, but a pattern of p-values close to .05 could still emerge due to cognitive biases or unintentional errors, particularly under pressure.\n\nIn probability terms, seeing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 without any intentional manipulation is tricky. It could occur due to multiple testing and selective reporting, but it’s less common than a random distribution that’s more balanced around .05.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it's certainly possible this pattern could arise without intentional misconduct, the probability isn’t particularly high due to the statistical improbability of this clustering under purely genuine circumstances. Therefore, I would judge the probability of this occurring without misconduct or p-hacking as moderately low.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 20"

If initial analyses with the full dataset did not support the hypothesis as strongly as desired, exclusions might help achieve significance.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Participants might be excluded to remove data points that diminish the strength of the results or increase variance, which is often a red flag for p-hacking or manipulation.\n\n3. **Difficult-to-Explain Anomalies**: Participants with outlier data that counters the hypothesis might have been intentionally excluded to prevent those data points from affecting the conclusions.\n\n4. **Pressure to Conform**: With pressure to deliver results aligned with expectations or prior assumptions, Lena might exclude participants to align the data more closely with the desired narrative.\n\nSuch exclusions could serve as a strategy to artificially enhance the findings by crafting a dataset that better suits the hypotheses or publication pressures.

    "content": "Assessing the probability of Lena committing academic misconduct involves considering various pieces of evidence provided and their implications:\n\n1. **Concentration of p-values**: There is a notable pattern of p-values just below .05, which can be suggestive of p-hacking. However, without additional context, it's not definitive proof.\n\n2. **Modification of Preregistration**: The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant red flag, though there might be non-malicious reasons, perhaps under pressure.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: With notes on participant exclusions predating submission, this aspect seems less suspect, indicating legitimate data management practices.\n\n4. **Data Management Logs**: Running multiple analyses aligns with robustness testing, a common and legitimate research practice, but could also be indicative of trying to find any significant result.\n\n5. **Previous Record**: Lena has a strong previous record, where work was well-documented and reproducible, suggesting a history of integrity.\n\n6. **Technical Issues**: The change in software and confirmed hard drive failure appear as genuine and independently verified issues, not inherently aligned with misconduct.\n\n7. **Pressure and Motivation**: The emails expressing pressure align with motivations that could lead to misconduct, though they're also consistent with the psychological pressures in academia.\n\nUpon balancing these pieces of evidence, it seems there are scattered indicators of potential misconduct, primarily in preregistration changes and statistical patterns, but also significant indications of legitimate procedural challenges and good historical conduct. Thus, it remains possible, but the evidence for misconduct is not overwhelmingly definitive.\n\n**Probability Judgment**: 40"

Considering the mix of red flags and plausible non-misconduct explanations, I would not have enough information to confidently conclude \"Yes\" or \"No\" without further investigation and context.\n\nTherefore, with the information currently available:\n\nNo."
