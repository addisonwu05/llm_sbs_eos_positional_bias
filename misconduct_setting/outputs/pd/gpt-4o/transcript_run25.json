The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The occurrence of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with very few just above .05 is often considered a red flag in statistical analyses. Under normal circumstances, with no data manipulation or p-hacking, p-values are expected to follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis. This means that, in a typical dataset of exploratory analyses where many hypotheses are tested, we would anticipate a roughly even distribution of p-values around any given threshold, including .05.\n\nThe presence of such a pattern—significant clustering of p-values just below .05—can suggest questionable research practices such as p-hacking, selective reporting, or questionable data manipulation. P-hacking involves manipulating data collection, analysis methods, or selection of results to achieve significant p-values. It can involve practices such as repeatedly running analyses and only reporting significant findings or changing data processing protocols to yield more favorable outcomes. These are strategies that inflate the false-positive rate, leading to an overrepresentation of p-values that barely achieve significance.\n\nHowever, an unusual distribution of p-values in Lena's results could also arise due to several benign factors:\n\n1. **Multiple Comparisons**: If numerous hypotheses are being tested, even by chance, some p-values could naturally fall just below the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Sample Size**: Small sample sizes can lead to variability in p-value distribution, sometimes clustering around critical values due to sheer chance.\n\n3. **Data Handling**: If the lab recently changed software or if data files were corrupted, it could inadvertently affect the results or data structure, though not necessarily to the particular pattern observed.\n\n4. **Statistical Tuning**: Legitimate methodological decisions made in response to journal reviews could alter the analysis just enough to shift some p-values below .05.\n\nNevertheless, the observed pattern is atypical under the null hypothesis across many exploratory analyses without any specific manipulation. It increases suspicion when data seems \"too perfect\" because the likelihood of such a pattern occurring naturally, purely due to chance, is low. It doesn’t definitively prove misconduct since specific conditions or adjustments could occasionally lead to such results. Still, the improbability of this pattern arising innocently lends significant weight to the possibility of some degree of p-hacking or other forms of bias.\n\nTherefore, considering the information and acknowledging the possibility of mundane factors, the likelihood of observing such a p-value concentration purely by chance without misconduct is notably low. Nonetheless, it’s vital to conduct a thorough inquiry to confirm or refute suspicions without prematurely concluding misconduct.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"

This pattern is a common consequence of certain research practices that strive to achieve statistical significance:\n\n1. **P-hacking**: This involves conducting multiple analyses or transforming data in various ways until significant results are found. By selectively reporting only those tests that yield p-values under .05, a researcher could create a skewed distribution where significant results are overrepresented.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: If Lena only included or emphasized analyses that supported the hypothesis (those with p-values just below .05), and disregarded or downplayed those that did not (those just above .05), this could lead to the observed pattern.\n\n3. **Data Manipulation**: Adjusting data values, altering sample sizes, or using inappropriate statistical methods intentionally to achieve desirable p-values can also lead to a concentration of p-values below .05.\n\n4. **Post-Hoc Analyses**: Frequently conducting post-hoc analyses and reporting only the significant findings, especially if these results align with hypothesized outcomes, can inflate the number of p-values just below .05.\n\nGiven these scenarios, if Lena were to fabricate or falsify data, or conduct analyses with the intent of obtaining significant results, it is very plausible that the dataset would exhibit this specific distribution of p-values. The occurrence of p-values clustering just below .05 is a well-documented outcome when misconduct is involved with attempts to present confirmation of hypotheses artificially.\n\nTherefore, if misconduct occurred, it would indeed be consistent with the pattern of p-values observed, making the likelihood of this pattern appearing very high.\n\nProbability Judgment: 90"

It serves as a safeguard against biased reporting and post-hoc alterations that might capitalize on chance findings. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection can be viewed with suspicion, especially if it involves changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, as these adjustments could potentially influence the study's conclusions.\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where such modifications might occur without misconduct:\n\n1. **Honest Error**: It is possible that Lena or someone in the lab initially recorded incorrect information in the preregistration document, and the modification was made to correct these errors. \n\n2. **Unanticipated Issues**: During the study, unanticipated issues might arise (e.g., procedural adjustments, data quality concerns) that necessitate changes in exclusion criteria or outcomes. Once recognized, these adjustments may be documented retroactively, albeit improperly altering the preregistration form.\n\n3. **Administrative Oversight**: Modifications might result from administrative processes, like syncing files or updating versions, without intent to deceive.\n\n4. **Clarity and Precision**: The changes might have been intended to clarify vague descriptions or make the document more precise, without fundamentally changing the pre-study intentions.\n\nDespite these possibilities, altering a preregistration document post hoc is generally frowned upon because it undermines the objectives of preregistration: transparency and accountability in the research process. Doing so raises concerns about researchers tailoring analyses to fit favorable outcomes rather than objectively testing hypotheses. It also calls into question the exploratory versus confirmatory nature of the analysis, potentially leading to biased results.\n\nThat being said, there can still be benign explanations for such modifications if they were indeed honest corrections or responses to unforeseen problems during the research process. However, given the context of a high-profile study under pressure to produce findings, naturally, this action casts doubt.\n\nIn summary, while there are potentially innocent reasons for such modifications, the likelihood that these modifications occurred without any misconduct—particularly intentional misleading practices—is relatively low due to the meticulous nature typically expected in preregistration.\n\nProbability Judgment: 30"

This would constitute a strategic move to mitigate inconsistencies between preregistered plans and the outcomes observed in the data.\n\nHere’s why such actions frequently align with misconduct:\n\n1. **Aligning Results with Pre-registered Claims**: To present an appearance of having a priori hypothesized results, changing preregistered criteria after observing data can help claim that results were confirmatory rather than exploratory.\n\n2. **Selective Misreporting**: Modifying primary outcomes or exclusion criteria can help highlight favorable results and obscure negative findings or inconvenient data points, thereby selectively shaping the narrative of the study.\n\n3. **Pressure for Positive Results**: Under pressure to produce significant results, as indicated by the urgency related to grant reviews, misconduct involving document modifications could be a deliberate attempt to secure favorable outcomes that might have otherwise been unsupported by the originally planned analyses.\n\n4. **Impression Management**: Changing the preregistration document post-data collection is a way to retroactively create an impression of methodological rigor and alignment between study execution and initial plans, despite deviations.\n\nIn the context of academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration document reflects an intent to manipulate the appearance of the research process to benefit from perceived rigor and transparency falsely.

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, it is still plausible that the lab's data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students. Here's why this behavior could still occur even with misconduct:\n\n1. **Appearance of Thoroughness**: Even if misconduct is present, maintaining multiple scripts with different criteria can provide an appearance of thoroughness and due diligence, which might be used to deflect suspicion of selective reporting.\n\n2. **Strategic Experimentation**: Lena could use alternative scripts to identify the combination of criteria that yields the most favorable results. This trial-and-error approach facilitates a form of p-hacking where data manipulation is optimized through various legitimate-appearing attempts.\n\n3. **Concealing Intentions**: In an environment where running multiple analyses is common practice, Lena’s use of various scripts could blend in, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate exploration of robustness from intentional manipulations aimed at achieving desired outcomes.\n\n4. **Lab Norms as Cover**: If other students were engaged in similar practices for legitimate reasons, Lena might exploit this lab norm to shield her own problematic practices under the guise of following standard procedures.\n\nTherefore, in the context of misconduct, having multiple analysis scripts in data logs may still occur, particularly if aiming to mask questionable practices within broader, legitimate scientific approaches.\n\nProbability Judgment: 70"

    "content": "Assessing the probability of Lena committing academic misconduct involves weighing all available evidence, both suggestive of misconduct and potentially exculpatory:\n\n1. **Suspicious Data Patterns**: The clustering of p-values just below .05 and the lack of those just above suggests possible p-hacking, which raises doubts.\n\n2. **Modifications to Preregistration**: The adjustment of the preregistration document post-data collection to alter criteria and outcomes raises concerns about retroactively adapting plans to better fit the results.\n\n3. **Expressions of Pressure**: Emails describing significant pressure and personal stakes do not directly indicate misconduct but highlight motivations that could drive unethical behavior.\n\n4. **Software and Hardware Issues**: The confirmed hard drive failure and software switch appear legitimate but can obscure data inconsistencies inadvertently or by design.\n\n5. **Data and Script Transparency**: Running multiple analysis scripts is a normal research practice and aligns with lab norms, decreasing suspicion associated with this behavior alone.\n\n6. **Exclusions with Documentation**: Properly documented participant exclusions predate submission and are consistent with routine data handling practices.\n\n7. **Previous Clean Record**: A history of passing data audits suggests a consistent pattern of good practice, favoring the possibility of adherence to research integrity.\n\nBased on a holistic consideration of these factors, while there are several red flags indicative of potential misconduct, there is also substantial evidence reflecting legitimate practices and exculpatory circumstances. These conflicting elements suggest a non-negligible risk of misconduct, but not high certainty.\n\nProbability Judgment: 50"
