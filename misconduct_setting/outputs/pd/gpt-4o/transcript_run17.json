The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is meant to establish a clear, immutable plan for data analysis before data collection takes place, to prevent \"p-hacking\" or data dredging where analysis procedures are altered post hoc to produce desirable results.\n\nHowever, there could be non-nefarious explanations for why a preregistration document might be modified post-data collection:\n\n1. **Software or File Management Issues**: The lab's recent switch in software could have inadvertently altered timestamps or created confusion in file handling.\n   \n2. **Clarification or Correction of Errors**: If Lena realized a genuine and honest mistake in the preregistration, she might have updated it to reflect the correction. This can sometimes happen if the original preregistration contained errors or ambiguous criteria that weren't noticed until later.\n\n3. **Miscommunication and Documentation Practices**: There may have been a misunderstanding about the protocol changes, and Lena might have believed she was permitted to make these updates after discussions with her supervisor for clarity or accuracy.\n\n4. **Unintentional Non-Chronological Modifications**: If hardware failure or mismanagement caused the files to be restored from a backup, this could result in files appearing to be modified out of the expected chronological order.\n\nWhile these explanations are plausible, it is generally expected that any such issues be transparently documented and reported promptly, ideally with the knowledge and agreement of all research personnel involved. The existence of these circumstances does not rule out misconduct, but they do provide alternative explanations for the discrepancies.\n\nGiven Lena's history of meticulous data handling and the fact that technical issues were present, there is some likelihood, though not certainty, that these modifications could occur without misconduct. Nonetheless, such after-the-fact modifications reduce the credibility of the evidence without clear, supporting documentation for any deviations from the original plan.\n\nConsidering all the above, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood of modifying a preregistration document after data collection, under these specific circumstances, could realistically be seen as moderate but still concerning.\n\nProbability Judgment: 40"

This type of action is consistent with efforts to ensure that the results fit the desired narrative, thereby increasing the apparent robustness and credibility of the findings.\n\nHere are the reasons supporting a high likelihood of such modifications under misconduct:\n\n1. **Post Hoc Adjustments to Achieve Significance**: By changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after observing the data, Lena could have altered the analytical approach to enhance or fabricate statistical significance.\n\n2. **Rationalizing the Analysis**: Adjusting the preregistration might serve to rationalize unexpected or undesirable results, aligning them with the theoretical predictions after seeing the data.\n\n3. **Cover for Other Manipulations**: Modifying the preregistration might also serve as a cover for other manipulations or fabrications within the dataset itself, aiming to make those manipulations appear as planned steps.\n\n4. **Evasion of Detection**: By altering preregistration, Lena could intend to present a seamless narrative to reviewers and assessors, avoiding the scrutiny that might arise from unexpected or anomalous findings.\n\nGiven these points, if Lena indeed engaged in academic misconduct, modifying the preregistration after data collection would be a very probable action in an attempt to conceal or fabricate favorable outcomes.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"

Academic environments can be high-pressure and competitive, particularly for PhD students whose future prospects, such as securing a postdoc, may heavily depend on the success of their projects.\n\nSeveral reasons support the likelihood of Lena writing such emails without committing misconduct:\n\n1. **Common Academic Pressures**: It is not uncommon for researchers, especially early-career ones, to feel pressure regarding the outcomes of their studies. With significant professional and financial stakes tied to research success, expressing such feelings candidly to a trusted friend is natural.\n\n2. **Expression of Anxiety and Stress**: Lena may have been venting her anxiety about potential consequences if the study did not yield positive results, which is a typical emotional response to a high-stakes situation.\n\n3. **Acknowledging the Stakes**: Simply recognizing the importance of a study for grant renewal or career progression doesn't imply misconduct. It reflects awareness of the realities of academic life.\n\n4. **Desire for Success**: Wanting a study to be successful is a common sentiment among researchers; the bridge to misconduct is crossed when that desire leads to unethical actions. Expressing a hope or need for positive results does not inherently imply willingness to engage in unethical behavior.\n\nWhile Lena's emails suggest an awareness of and concern about the potential impacts of her study's results, these sentiments alone do not inherently indicate misconduct.

    "content": "Assessing the probability of academic misconduct involves weighing both the evidence suggestive of misconduct and the alternative explanations provided for each piece of evidence. Here is a summary of the key points:\n\n1. **Modification of Preregistration**: Modifying the preregistration after data collection leans suspiciously toward misconduct but may have plausible non-nefarious explanations, such as error correction or software issues.\n\n2. **Emails Expressing Pressure**: The pressure expressed in Lena's emails is a common sentiment and does not inherently indicate misconduct, though it does highlight high stakes.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Participants**: The exclusion of participants who did not understand the task was well-documented and aligns with standard practices.\n\n4. **Concentration of P-Values Below .05**: This pattern is a significant red flag typically associated with p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n5. **Multiple Analysis Scripts**: Running multiple scripts can be consistent with robust analysis practices, although it could potentially facilitate cherry-picking results.\n\n6. **Technical Issues**: The software switch and confirmed hardware failure, while complicating, are plausible and independently verifiable technical incidents.\n\n7. **Past Research Record**: Lena's previous studies had been audited and found to be well-documented, suggesting a history of good research practices.\n\nGiven the balance of evidence, while there are elements suggestive of potential misconduct, there are also credible explanations and supporting evidence of legitimate practices in several areas. The context of high stakes, combined with specific suspicious patterns (e.g., p-value concentrations), slightly tips the scale away from innocence, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nProbability Judgment: 60"

    "content": "Based on the evidence presented and the mixture of possible explanations for each item, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct without further investigation. The evidence presents a scenario where both misconduct and non-nefarious explanations are plausible. Therefore, determining a definitive \"Yes\" or \"No\" requires additional context or investigation beyond what is provided here."
