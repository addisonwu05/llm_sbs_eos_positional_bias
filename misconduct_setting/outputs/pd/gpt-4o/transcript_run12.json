The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Normally, p-values should be uniformly distributed across the range from 0 to 1, under the null hypothesis. Therefore, having many p-values clustered just below .05 could indicate selective reporting or multiple testing, increasing the likelihood of Type I errors.\n\nThere could be innocent explanations for this pattern as well. Exploratory analyses often involve multiple tests, which can by chance produce some p-values just below .05, especially in smaller datasets or when specific hypotheses align well with the data. The recent switch of software might have introduced subtle changes in the randomness of the outputs due to different numerical algorithms. Lena's assertions that these are unintentional mistakes or miscommunications could also be valid, especially given her history of careful data work.\n\nHowever, given the context of a high-pressure environment for publishable results, the pressure may have unnoticeably influenced Lena to unconsciously select or favor analyses that yielded significant p-values. While plausible, this scenario is difficult to quantify as purely unintentional without strong evidence supporting it.\n\nTaking all factors into account—Lena's previous record, the specific allegations, the circumstantial explanations available, and the statistical anomaly—although it's possible for such a pattern to arise by chance or discretion in exploratory analysis, it's less likely compared to a more balanced, unbiased result distribution.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not engage in academic misconduct and assuming random variation within proper methodological boundaries, the likelihood of observing a dataset with an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is low.\n\nProbability Judgment: 20"

The p-value threshold of .05 is a common cut-off for significance in many scientific fields, and results just below this threshold are more likely to be perceived as meaningful and supportive of the hypothesis.\n\nWhen researchers engage in misconduct like p-hacking, they may consciously or unconsciously adjust their analyses to produce p-values just below .05. This could involve selectively reporting certain analyses, excluding outliers that push p-values over the threshold, or other manipulations to achieve the desired outcome. Such strategies can lead to the suspicious pattern of p-values being concentrated just below .05.\n\nIn the context of the allegations, if misconduct occurred, it is plausible to expect a notable clustering of p-values just below the .05 mark because this would ostensibly validate the theoretical framework being tested, thus appearing to meet the expectations for a high-profile publication.\n\nTherefore, if Lena engaged in academic misconduct, it is quite likely that the final dataset would display an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.\n\nProbability Judgment: 85"
