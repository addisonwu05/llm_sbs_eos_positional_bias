  "Based on the provided information, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct without more in-depth investigation and context. The evidence includes potential indicators of misconduct, such as changes to the preregistration and the clustering of p-values just below .05, alongside legitimate explanations like documented participant exclusions and verified technical issues.\n\nTherefore, a definitive yes or no answer cannot be reached solely from the given evidence. A thorough investigation by an expert committee would be necessary to reach an informed conclusion. Thus, I cannot confidently say \"Yes\" or \"No\" without further evidence."
