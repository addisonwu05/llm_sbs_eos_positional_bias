  "As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, based on the previously outlined evaluation of the evidence, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether Lena committed academic misconduct. The information presents both incriminating and exculpatory elements, making a definitive \"Yes\" or \"No\" judgment inappropriate without further investigation or context. An official inquiry would be necessary to reach a conclusion regarding misconduct."
