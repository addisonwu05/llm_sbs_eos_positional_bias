The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

For example, neuroimaging data often requires excluding participants with excessive head movement or artifacts that are only detected during processing.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, the earlier script likely contained a preliminary analysis before proper exclusion criteria were applied. This would represent normal refinement of the dataset rather than p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nGiven these considerations in a non-misconduct scenario, I judge it highly likely that an earlier analysis script would include participants who were later legitimately excluded.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the software switch and confirmed hard drive failure could still be quite likely to occur, though they might take on different significance.\n\nLet's analyze why these events are compatible with a misconduct scenario:\n\n1. **Opportunistic exploitation**: A researcher engaging in misconduct could exploit a legitimate software transition as cover for inconsistencies in analysis or results. The switch creates natural discontinuities that make tracking changes more difficult.\n\n2. **Convenient timing**: While the hard drive failure itself may be genuine (as confirmed by IT), its timing could be opportunistically leveraged to explain missing files that might otherwise reveal problematic data handling.\n\n3. **Selective file loss**: Even with a legitimate hardware failure, a researcher committing misconduct might selectively recover or backup files, ensuring that certain problematic records remain \"unfortunately lost\" while preserving others.\n\n4. **Plausible deniability**: These circumstances provide excellent plausible deniability for missing documentation. When questioned about inconsistencies or missing analyses, these events offer a ready-made explanation.\n\n5. **Complexity as concealment**: The combination of software transition and hardware failure creates analytical complexity that makes scrutiny more difficult for investigators trying to reconstruct the research process.\n\nThe key point is that these events could be entirely genuine technical issues that a researcher committing misconduct later exploits as convenient cover. The IT confirmation of the hardware failure indicates that at least this aspect was a real event, regardless of how it might have been used.\n\nIn cases of scientific fraud, legitimate complications like these are often woven into explanations for data irregularities, creating a mixture of truth and deception that's difficult to untangle.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

    "content": "To evaluate whether Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to analyze the complete pattern of evidence while considering how likely each finding would be under both misconduct and non-misconduct scenarios.\n\n**Evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking that is very difficult to explain innocently.\n\n2. Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and represents a serious breach of research integrity.\n\n3. Lena's emails expressing that she \"needs this one to work\" and discussing career consequences reveal clear motivation, though they don't necessarily prove action.\n\n4. An earlier analysis script included additional participants who were later excluded from the final dataset, potentially suggesting selective reporting.\n\n**Evidence compatible with either scenario:**\n\n5. The presence of multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria matches lab-wide practice but could represent either legitimate robustness testing or disguised p-hacking.\n\n6. The laptop hard drive failure and software switch are independently confirmed events but could be opportunistically used to explain inconsistencies.\n\n7. Lena's prior clean record could indicate either consistent integrity or first-time misconduct under unusual pressure.\n\n**Evidence suggesting innocence:**\n\n8. Proper contemporaneous documentation of legitimate participant exclusions (sleeping participants, confusion) suggests adherence to good research practices.\n\nThe most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution, both of which are statistical anomalies that have very low probability under honest research practices but very high probability under misconduct.\n\nWeighing these factors together, there appears to be substantial evidence pointing toward academic misconduct, though not with absolute certainty.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"

These represent serious breaches of research integrity that align with intentional manipulation rather than honest mistakes.\n\nWhen combined with her explicit statements about needing the study to work, the exclusion of participants from earlier analyses, and the pattern of other concerning practices, the evidence collectively points toward deliberate misconduct rather than a series of unfortunate coincidences or misunderstandings.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some proper documentation practices, they are outweighed by the more serious indicators of p-hacking and improper manipulation of research protocols.\n\nNo"
