    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When examining multiple exploratory analyses, we'd expect to see p-values distributed across the range, including values just above .05.\n\n2. **The \"p-hacking\" signature**: The described pattern (many values just below .05, few just above) is a classic signature of p-hacking - where researchers manipulate analyses until they achieve statistical significance. This could involve trying different exclusion criteria, covariates, or analysis methods until finding a significant result.\n\n3. **Exploratory analyses vulnerability**: The fact that this pattern appears in \"exploratory analyses\" is particularly noteworthy, as these are precisely the analyses where researchers have more flexibility in analytical choices.\n\n4. **Probability of natural occurrence**: The probability of naturally observing multiple p-values clustered just below .05 with almost none just above is extremely low without some form of selection bias or data manipulation.\n\nPotential innocent explanations:\n- Publication bias (only reporting significant findings)\n- Unconscious p-hacking (making seemingly justified analytical choices that happen to produce significant results)\n- Selective reporting of analyses that \"worked\"\n- Software issues during the transition period\n\nHowever, the specific clustering described is statistically unlikely to occur by chance alone. While these explanations might account for some bias toward significant results, the sharp discontinuity around .05 (many just below, almost none just above) is difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nThis pattern represents one of the strongest statistical red flags for potential data manipulation in research.\n\nProbability judgment: 15"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the pattern of an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with very few just above .05 is extremely likely to appear in the data.\n\nThis pattern is widely recognized as a classic fingerprint of data manipulation or p-hacking for several reasons:\n\n1. **Statistical threshold targeting**: Researchers engaging in misconduct often specifically aim to get p-values below the conventional significance threshold of .05. When manipulating analyses or data, they would stop once they achieve values just below this threshold (e.g., .049, .047), as there would be no motivation to continue manipulating to get even lower p-values.\n\n2. **Strategic manipulation**: If someone is deliberately manipulating analyses to achieve significance, they would convert borderline non-significant results (p-values just above .05) into significant ones (just below .05), creating exactly this discontinuity in the p-value distribution.\n\n3. **Efficiency of fraud**: A researcher committing misconduct would typically expend the minimum effort needed to claim significance. Getting p-values to .047 or .049 requires less manipulation than pushing them to .01 or .001, making this clustering common in cases of fraud.\n\n4. **Empirical evidence**: Multiple forensic analyses of scientific misconduct cases have shown this exact pattern. In fact, the unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 has become one of the primary statistical methods used to detect potential fraud in research.\n\n5. **Motivation alignment**: Given the pressure described from Professor Mills to produce publishable findings before a grant review, and the fact that publishable results typically require statistical significance, Lena would have strong motivation to ensure results passed the significance threshold.\n\nThe pattern described is so strongly associated with data manipulation that statisticians use it as a primary detection tool for potential scientific misconduct in publication records.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

Here's why:\n\n1. **Result-driven exclusions**: A researcher engaging in misconduct would selectively remove participants whose data weakens the desired effect. This is a common form of p-hacking that doesn't require fabricating data—just strategically excluding \"inconvenient\" data points.\n\n2. **Post-hoc criteria creation**: After seeing the full dataset, someone committing fraud could retroactively create exclusion criteria specifically designed to remove participants who don't show the effect, while appearing to be legitimate methodological decisions.\n\n3. **Efficiency and detectability**: Compared to other forms of misconduct like fabricating data, selective participant exclusion is:\n   - Relatively easy to implement\n   - Less likely to create obvious statistical anomalies\n   - Easier to defend as legitimate if questioned\n   - Often difficult to distinguish from valid exclusions without the original data\n\n4. **Context supports this method**: The described situation presents perfect conditions for this type of manipulation:\n   - Pressure from Professor Mills to produce publishable findings\n   - A high-profile experiment with significant career implications\n   - Software transition providing cover for data processing changes\n   - Missing files due to hard drive failure obscuring the full analysis history\n\n5. **Compatibility with other evidence**: The unusual clustering of p-values just below .05 is precisely what would result from strategic participant exclusion to push borderline results into statistical significance.\n\n6. **Difficulty of detection**: With the lab's recent software switch and hard drive failure, Lena could reasonably claim that exclusions were due to technical issues or implementation of standard criteria that weren't properly applied in early analyses.\n\nSelective participant exclusion is among the most common forms of data manipulation precisely because it can appear methodologically justified while allowing researchers to engineer their desired outcomes.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

These events represent common technical challenges in research environments.\n\nLet's examine each component:\n\n1. **Software switch mid-project**:\n   - Research labs regularly update or change statistical software for various legitimate reasons:\n     - Institutional license changes\n     - New software with better features becoming available\n     - Compatibility with collaborators' systems\n     - Department-wide standardization initiatives\n     - Better support for specific analyses\n   - Mid-project transitions, while not ideal, are common when projects span many months\n\n2. **Hard drive failure**:\n   - The IT department's independent confirmation provides objective verification\n   - Laptop hard drives have measurable failure rates (typically 3-5% annually)\n   - Research computers often face heavy computational loads that can accelerate wear\n   - The timing, while unfortunate, isn't inherently suspicious\n\n3. **Missing files as a consequence**:\n   - Data loss during hardware failures is expected, especially if:\n     - Backups were scheduled but not yet completed\n     - Only certain directories were covered by automatic backups\n     - The failure occurred suddenly without warning signs\n   - File incompatibilities during software transitions commonly result in regenerated files that may differ slightly from originals\n\n4. **Contextual considerations**:\n   - These technical issues are commonplace enough that they were specifically mentioned in the case background\n   - The IT department's confirmation provides third-party verification\n   - The software switch affected the entire lab, not just Lena's project\n\n5. **Combined probability**:\n   - While either event alone is common, the combination does represent an unfortunate coincidence\n   - However, research projects often face multiple technical challenges, especially longer projects\n\nThese technical difficulties represent ordinary challenges in research environments. The independent confirmation from IT provides objective evidence that at least the hard drive failure was a genuine technical problem rather than a fabricated excuse.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"

Someone engaging in misconduct might opportunistically use these legitimate technical issues to explain away inconsistencies or gaps in research documentation.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

The timing of the documentation is particularly important, as it suggests these were straightforward methodological decisions rather than result-driven exclusions.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

This specific exclusion pattern is consistent with proper research practice regardless of whether misconduct occurred elsewhere in the study.\n\nHere's why this is likely even in a scenario involving misconduct:\n\n1. **Legitimate reasons independent of results**:\n   - Falling asleep during tasks and not understanding instructions are objectively valid exclusion criteria\n   - These issues are typically obvious during data collection and would be noted immediately\n   - Such exclusions would be justified regardless of how they affect study outcomes\n   - Even researchers engaging in misconduct would recognize these as standard exclusions\n\n2. **Documentation practicalities**:\n   - Notes made contemporaneously in raw data files represent standard lab practice\n   - These particular exclusions would likely be documented by any researcher, ethical or not\n   - The timing (predating submission) is consistent with normal research documentation\n   - This level of documentation for obvious exclusion cases is routine\n\n3. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - A researcher committing misconduct would likely focus on less obvious manipulations\n   - These clear-cut exclusions provide \"cover\" of normal research practice\n   - Documenting obvious exclusions properly while manipulating other aspects of the data would be strategically sound\n\n4. **Partial integrity**:\n   - Academic misconduct often involves specific questionable practices rather than fabricating everything\n   - Many parts of a study with misconduct may still follow proper protocols\n   - These particular exclusions may represent the legitimate aspects of the research\n\n5. **Risk management**:\n   - Properly documenting obvious exclusions reduces scrutiny\n   - These straightforward cases create an appearance of methodological rigor\n   - Contemporary documentation of clear exclusion cases would be maintained even by someone engaging in other forms of misconduct\n\nThis specific instance of excluding participants with contemporaneous documentation likely represents standard research practice that would occur regardless of other potential misconduct. The presence of proper documentation for these obvious exclusions doesn't preclude the possibility of more subtle manipulations elsewhere in the analysis process.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I'll analyze the key evidence points and weigh their implications:\n\n**Strong evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **P-value clustering:** The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and few just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally but very likely in cases of misconduct.\n\n2. **Modified preregistration:** File timestamps show the preregistration was altered after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and strongly indicates results-driven decisions.\n\n3. **Email statements:** Lena's emails expressing that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" and that she \"needs this one to work\" reveal clear motivation and pressure, though they don't prove misconduct by themselves.\n\n4. **Participant exclusion patterns:** Earlier analysis scripts included more participants who were later excluded, which aligns with selective removal to achieve desired results.\n\n**Mitigating or neutral evidence:**\n\n1. **Clean record:** Lena previously passed an independent data audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" work.\n\n2. **Software switch and hard drive failure:** These events provide legitimate explanations for some inconsistencies, though they could also provide convenient cover.\n\n3. **Multiple analysis scripts:** The lab's culture of running robustness checks creates ambiguity - this practice is consistent with both good science and potential p-hacking.\n\n4. **Legitimate exclusions:** The two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions had contemporaneous documentation, suggesting proper procedure in at least some cases.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe modified preregistration is particularly damning - changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection violates fundamental research principles. Combined with the suspicious p-value distribution and the pattern of participant exclusions, these form a compelling pattern.\n\nWhile Lena's prior clean record and some legitimate documentation practices provide some counterevidence, they don't adequately explain the statistical anomalies and preregistration changes.\n\nThe totality of evidence indicates a high likelihood of academic misconduct, with the most problematic patterns being difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
