The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Pre-established exclusion criteria: Participants might be excluded based on criteria set before data collection (e.g., performance thresholds, attention checks, equipment malfunctions).\n\n2. Outlier detection: After initial data processing, statistical outliers might be identified and removed according to standard procedures.\n\n3. Data quality issues: Some participants' data might show excessive noise, artifacts, or technical problems that only become apparent during detailed analysis.\n\n4. Reviewer suggestions: Journal reviewers sometimes recommend additional exclusion criteria or different analytical approaches.\n\n5. Software transition issues: Since the lab recently switched software, there might have been inconsistencies in how exclusion criteria were implemented.\n\nThe existence of an earlier version with more participants is actually consistent with normal research practices. Researchers typically run preliminary analyses on all collected data, then apply exclusion criteria to create the final dataset. This process is legitimate as long as:\n- Exclusion criteria are justified and documented\n- The criteria aren't manipulated specifically to achieve significance\n- The exclusions are reported transparently in the final paper\n\nWhat would be suspicious is if participants were excluded specifically to achieve significant results, if exclusion criteria changed post-hoc without justification, or if the exclusions weren't properly reported in the methods section.\n\nGiven that Lena has \"a previously strong record of careful data handling,\" and assuming proper research practices, it's quite likely that legitimate participant exclusions would occur between early and final analyses.\n\nProbability: 80"

Running initial analyses on the complete dataset\n2. Identifying which participants' data are preventing the desired outcome\n3. Finding post-hoc justifications to exclude those specific participants\n4. Only reporting the final \"clean\" dataset that shows significant results\n\nThe situation described contains several red flags consistent with this type of misconduct:\n- The anonymous whistleblower specifically mentioned that the data \"look too perfect\"\n- There are suggestions that \"key analyses were changed after reviewers' comments\"\n- The results show strong statistical significance across both primary and secondary analyses\n- The high-profile nature of the experiment and the pressure from Professor Mills for publishable results create motivation\n\nWhat makes this particularly suspicious is the combination of excluded participants and \"too perfect\" results. When researchers engage in misconduct, they often don't fabricate data entirely (which is easier to detect) but instead selectively include/exclude real data to artificially strengthen their findings.\n\nThe missing files due to a \"hard drive failure\" could potentially be a convenient explanation for missing documentation of the original analysis plan or complete dataset.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, the exclusion of participants between versions would almost certainly be part of the manipulation rather than legitimate scientific procedure, especially given the concern that analyses changed after reviewer comments.\n\nProbability: 95"

Administrative error: Perhaps the modifications were minor corrections to typos or clarifications that didn't substantially alter the research plan.\n\n2.

Let me analyze why:\n\nThese emails reveal three critical elements typically present in cases of research misconduct:\n\n1. **External pressure**: \"My supervisor was counting on this study to save the grant\" shows Lena felt direct pressure from authority. This establishes a powerful external motivation to produce specific results rather than report findings objectively. In misconduct cases, this pressure often serves as initial justification for small ethical compromises that escalate.\n\n2. **Personal career stakes**: \"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" demonstrates Lena perceives her entire career trajectory depends on this specific outcome. This represents classic career-preservation motivation present in many documented fraud cases, where researchers feel trapped between their career and research integrity.\n\n3. **Results-oriented mindset**: \"I need this one to work\" is particularly revealing. The phrasing focuses on getting a specific outcome rather than discovering the truth. For someone who later commits misconduct, this statement reflects a psychological shift from the scientific goal of answering questions to the personal goal of obtaining particular results.\n\nIn cases of proven research misconduct, investigators often find precisely this type of communication preceding the fraudulent activity. These statements:\n- Document the psychological rationalization process\n- Establish clear motivation for the subsequent misconduct\n- Show awareness that the proper scientific approach might not yield the \"needed\" results\n- Reveal a mindset focused on outcomes rather than process\n\nThese emails would constitute strong contextual evidence supporting intentional misconduct rather than honest mistakes, particularly when combined with the modified preregistration documents and selective participant exclusion.\n\nFor someone who did commit misconduct, such emails would be extremely likely as they capture the typical psychological progression toward justifying data manipulation or fabrication.\n\nProbability: 95"

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, this pattern would be highly unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nHere's why this distribution is problematic from a statistical perspective:\n\n1. Natural distribution of p-values: If null hypotheses are being tested honestly, p-values should follow a uniform distribution (or, if true effects exist, a right-skewed distribution with more very low p-values). Either way, there should be roughly equal numbers of p-values just below and just above arbitrary thresholds like .05.\n\n2. The \"cliff\" at .05: The described pattern shows what researchers call a \"p-value cliff\" - an abrupt drop in frequency precisely at the significance threshold. This pattern has been extensively studied in meta-research and is considered one of the strongest statistical indicators of selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\n3. Multiple exploratory analyses: The fact that this pattern appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it even less likely to be coincidental. Natural variability might create this pattern by chance in a single test, but seeing it repeatedly across multiple analyses is extremely improbable.\n\nFor this pattern to emerge without misconduct, several unlikely scenarios would need to coincide:\n\n- An extraordinary statistical fluke across multiple analyses\n- A series of methodological decisions that coincidentally produced this pattern\n- Multiple legitimate exclusion criteria that happened to push p-values from just above to just below .05\n\nThis pattern has been extensively studied in fields like meta-science, and when observed across multiple analyses, it's considered one of the strongest statistical signatures of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nWhile not impossible to occur naturally, the probability of this pattern emerging without some form of data manipulation or selective reporting is extremely low.\n\nProbability: 5"

This creates an artificial clustering just below .05, as researchers have no incentive to continue manipulating once they've achieved \"significance.\"\n\n2. **Selective reporting**: If multiple analyses are conducted but only significant ones reported, this artificially eliminates p-values above .05 from the final dataset.\n\n3. **Data exclusion**: Selectively removing \"problematic\" participants or data points until analyses reach significance typically pushes borderline p-values from slightly above to slightly below .05.\n\n4. **Exploratory analyses**: The mention that this pattern appears in \"several exploratory analyses\" is particularly telling. Exploratory analyses are especially vulnerable to manipulation since they lack the constraint of pre-registered methods.\n\nThis distribution has been so consistently linked to misconduct that it's used in forensic analysis of scientific papers. Meta-analyses examining thousands of published studies have found this exact pattern to be a reliable indicator of questionable research practices. The seminal paper by Simonsohn et al.

This apparent contradiction can be explained by several important factors in how research misconduct typically develops:\n\n1. **Escalation patterns**: Research misconduct often follows an escalation pattern rather than appearing suddenly. Researchers typically begin their careers following proper protocols and only later, under specific pressures, begin to cut corners or manipulate data.\n\n2. **Situational pressures**: The current case involves unique pressures explicitly mentioned in the scenario - a high-profile study, supervisor pressure regarding grant renewal, and Lena's own concerns about postdoc prospects. These specific pressures might not have existed for earlier projects.\n\n3. **First-time offending**: Studies of scientific misconduct show many cases involve researchers with previously clean records who succumb to pressure at critical career junctures. The third year of a PhD program often represents such a pivotal moment.\n\n4. **Risk-benefit calculation changes**: As career stakes increase (approaching job market, high-profile journals, grant renewals), the perceived benefits of misconduct can outweigh perceived risks in ways that weren't true for earlier, lower-stakes projects.\n\n5. **Rationalization development**: The psychological ability to rationalize misconduct typically develops gradually. A researcher might initially adhere strictly to protocols but gradually develop justifications for bending rules.\n\nThe specific details mentioned - that she's a third-year student working on a \"high-profile experiment\" with a supervisor \"under pressure\" - suggest this project had uniquely high stakes compared to earlier work.\n\nThe emails stating that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" and \"I need this one to work\" further indicate that Lena viewed this particular study as having exceptional career importance.\n\nTherefore, even if misconduct occurred in this study, her previous clean record and well-documented prior work could be genuine, reflecting a change in behavior rather than consistent practices.\n\nProbability: 75"

This helps assess whether results depend on specific researcher choices rather than representing true effects.\n\n2. **Multiverse analysis**: The approach of systematically exploring how results change under different analytical decisions has been formalized as \"multiverse analysis\" or \"specification curve analysis\" - increasingly recommended methodological approaches in fields like cognitive neuroscience.\n\n3. **Transparency in analytical flexibility**: Storing multiple versions demonstrates transparency about the range of analyses conducted, rather than hiding exploratory approaches.\n\n4. **Lab-wide methodological initiative**: The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push\" and other students show similar patterns strongly suggests this was an institutionally encouraged practice rather than individual manipulation.\n\n5. **Documentation in official logs**: The documentation of these multiple analyses in official lab logs indicates they were conducted openly as part of standard procedure, not hidden.\n\nSeveral aspects make this particularly consistent with honest research:\n- The scripts were properly stored in the lab's official data management system\n- The pattern matches what other students in the lab were doing\n- It was part of an explicit methodological initiative\n- Different criteria were explored in both directions (stricter and looser)\n\nThis approach actually demonstrates methodological sophistication and transparency rather than misconduct. In modern research practice, exploring analytical robustness through multiple analyses is increasingly seen as more rigorous than running only a single analysis.\n\nProbability: 95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria in the lab's data management logs could still be quite likely, but would serve a different purpose within her workflow.\n\nIn this scenario, these multiple analyses could represent:\n\n1. **P-hacking infrastructure**: The various scripts might document Lena's process of testing multiple analytical approaches until finding ones that yielded significant results. Having both \"stricter and looser exclusion criteria\" versions would be particularly useful for selectively applying criteria that produce desired outcomes.\n\n2. **Plausible deniability**: Creating multiple documented analyses provides cover for selective reporting. If questioned, each individual analysis could be defended as legitimate exploration, even if the selection of which one to report was driven by results rather than methodological considerations.\n\n3. **Camouflage through conformity**: By matching the pattern of other students in the lab during a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness,\" Lena's multiple analyses would appear normal and methodologically sound, effectively hiding questionable practices in plain sight.\n\n4. **Strategic transparency**: Documenting multiple analyses in official logs creates an appearance of openness, while still allowing for undocumented selective decisions about which analyses to emphasize in the final paper.\n\n5. **Exploitation of legitimate practices**: The lab-wide robustness initiative would provide perfect cover for conducting numerous analyses with the hidden intention of selecting favorable ones, rather than comprehensively reporting the range of outcomes.\n\nThe key distinction is not in the creation of multiple analyses (which both honest and dishonest researchers might do), but in how the results were ultimately selected, interpreted, and reported. If misconduct occurred, these multiple scripts would represent the \"fishing expedition\" that led to the unusually perfect p-values just below .05.\n\nThis pattern is particularly insidious because it mimics recommended practices while subverting their purpose. Multiple analyses for robustness testing should lead to more nuanced, qualified conclusions—not cleaner, more significant results.\n\nProbability: 85"

    "content": "I'll evaluate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct by analyzing the evidence and considering how consistent it is with misconduct versus honest research.\n\n**Evidence strongly suggesting misconduct:**\n\n1. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a serious violation of research integrity principles and directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\n2. **P-value distribution anomaly**: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above. This statistical pattern is one of the strongest indicators of p-hacking recognized in meta-scientific research.\n\n3. **Excluded participants from earlier analysis**: Participants present in an earlier analysis were excluded in the final dataset, potentially suggesting selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Emails expressing result-oriented mindset**: Lena's emails stating she \"needs this one to work\" and concerns about null results hurting her postdoc chances reveal motivation and pressure that could lead to misconduct.\n\n**Evidence potentially compatible with either scenario:**\n\n5. **Software switch and hard drive failure**: While convenient for explaining inconsistencies, these events were independently confirmed and could happen regardless of misconduct.\n\n6. **Multiple analysis scripts**: Running various analyses with different exclusion criteria matches both legitimate robustness testing and potential p-hacking practices.\n\n7. **Prior clean record**: Lena's previous work passed audits, but misconduct often develops under specific pressures rather than being a consistent pattern.\n\n**Evidence suggesting proper research conduct:**\n\n8. **Documented participant exclusions**: Two participants were excluded based on notes (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) predating submission, showing proper contemporaneous documentation.\n\n9. **Lab-wide robustness initiative**: Multiple analysis scripts were part of a lab-wide methodology initiative, with other students showing similar patterns.\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the unusual p-value distribution - both extremely unlikely in honest research. While some evidence is compatible with proper conduct, the core methodological violations strongly suggest deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results.\n\nProbability: 85"
