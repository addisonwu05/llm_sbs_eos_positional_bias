The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, possible innocent explanations might include:\n\n1.

Lack of training: Lena might not have fully understood preregistration protocols.\n\nHowever, these explanations have significant problems:\n- As a third-year PhD student in neuroscience, Lena should understand basic research integrity principles.\n- Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (not just analysis methods) after seeing data is a fundamental violation of preregistration.\n- The modifications specifically affected criteria that determine which data points are included and which outcomes are considered \"primary\" - both highly consequential for statistical results.\n- The timing (after data collection) suggests the changes could have been motivated by the data's appearance.\n\nEven with honest intentions, modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection represents a serious deviation from proper scientific procedure.

Pressure context: The scenario mentions Professor Mills is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a grant review, creating motivation to ensure \"positive\" results.\n\n3.

Psychological preparation: People often telegraph their intentions or rationalize misconduct beforehand.

By running initial analyses and identifying which participants' data points work against the hypothesis, a researcher can dramatically improve statistical significance through targeted exclusions.\n\n2.

Lost files resulting from hardware failures are a common and unfortunate reality, even with backup systems in place.\n\nCombined likelihood:\n- Neither event is particularly unusual in research settings\n- Both events have independent verification (lab-wide software change and IT department documentation)\n- These types of disruptions regularly affect research projects without involving misconduct\n- The documentation of these events before the investigation suggests they weren't fabricated after questions arose\n\nWhile these circumstances might create opportunities for data to be lost or methods to be inconsistent, both events represent common, independently verified technical issues that researchers regularly face, regardless of their ethical conduct.\n\n85"

Here's why:\n\nSoftware switch during the project:\n1. Software transitions occur in research labs for legitimate reasons independent of any individual researcher's conduct.\n2. As a lab-wide change, this would have been decided at a higher level and would affect all researchers, not just Lena.\n3. Such transitions happen with similar frequency in labs with and without misconduct cases.\n\nHard drive failure:\n1. Hardware failures are common random events that occur regardless of a researcher's ethical practices.\n2. The IT department's independent confirmation provides objective evidence that an actual hardware failure occurred.\n3. The timing documentation (repair records) offers verification that this was a real event.\n\nHowever, if Lena did commit misconduct, these circumstances could have:\n- Provided an opportunity to explain missing documentation or inconsistencies\n- Created periods of reduced oversight during transitions\n- Served as convenient explanations for any data irregularities discovered later\n- Been strategically leveraged to make misconduct more difficult to detect\n\nIt's important to note that someone committing misconduct might take advantage of genuine technical issues as cover, rather than fabricating the issues themselves. The software switch and hard drive failure could be entirely real events that happened to create convenient opportunities.\n\nReal technical difficulties occur with similar frequency across all research contexts, but researchers engaging in misconduct may be more likely to use these legitimate issues to their advantage when explaining irregularities.\n\n75"

    "content": "To assess the probability of academic misconduct, I need to analyze the pattern of evidence holistically.\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. Modified preregistration after data collection: The preregistration document was altered to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data had been collected. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\n2. Emails showing pressure and motivation: Lena wrote that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant,\" that \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc,\" and that she \"needs this one to work.\" These demonstrate clear motive.\n\n3. Participant exclusions: An earlier analysis script showed additional participants who were later excluded from the final dataset, suggesting potential selective reporting.\n\n4. Suspicious p-value distribution: The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above. This pattern is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking.\n\nEvidence suggesting innocence:\n\n1. Clean prior record: Lena had no previous data irregularities, and her earlier work passed an independent audit as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. Legitimate exclusions: Two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions were excluded with notes predating submission.\n\n3. Lab-wide robustness testing: Multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide initiative, not unique to Lena.\n\n4. Technical difficulties: A verified software switch and documented hard drive failure could explain some inconsistencies.\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damning evidence is the modified preregistration and the suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05, both of which are difficult to explain innocently. The participant exclusions could have legitimate explanations but become suspicious in context.\n\nWhile some innocent explanations exist, the pattern strongly suggests deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results.\n\n80"

The modified preregistration after data collection, suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above, selective participant exclusion, and explicitly stated motivation about needing the study to \"work\" for her career form a coherent pattern consistent with misconduct.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate explanations for certain actions, the overall evidence pattern—particularly the modified preregistration and the statistically improbable distribution of p-values—is difficult to explain through innocent means alone.\n\nThe combination of clear motive, opportunity, and multiple statistical irregularities that all point in the direction of achieving significant results suggests deliberate manipulation rather than coincidence or honest error."
