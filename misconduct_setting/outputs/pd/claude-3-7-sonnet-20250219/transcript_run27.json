The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is generally considered a form of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, there are only limited legitimate scenarios that could explain such modifications:\n\n1. Technical error or misunderstanding: Perhaps Lena believed she was updating documentation rather than the actual preregistration, or didn't understand that modifications weren't allowed after data collection.\n\n2. Administrative correction: In rare cases, researchers might correct obvious errors or typos in preregistration documents. However, changing substantive elements like exclusion criteria or primary outcomes goes well beyond this.\n\n3. Confusion about timing: If there was confusion about when data collection officially began, Lena might have mistakenly thought modifications were still permissible.\n\n4. Software transition issues: The scenario mentions the lab recently switched software, which could potentially create file timestamp discrepancies that make legitimate modifications appear to have occurred after data collection.\n\nHowever, these explanations have significant limitations. The research community considers preregistration modifications after data collection to be improper, and the specific changes to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes are particularly problematic elements that directly impact statistical significance. Any competent researcher should understand these principles, especially a third-year PhD student.\n\nFurthermore, these aren't minor tweaks but changes to fundamental analysis parameters that determine which data points are analyzed and which outcomes are considered primary (versus exploratory).

This type of manipulation represents a common form of questionable research practice that directly enables a researcher to present more favorable results.\n\nFor a researcher engaging in misconduct:\n\n1. Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data is an effective way to remove participants whose results don't support the hypothesis. This could transform a non-significant result into a significant one with minimal effort and without fabricating raw data.\n\n2. Altering primary outcomes after data collection allows the researcher to elevate post-hoc any measures that showed significant effects while demoting those that didn't. This creates the false impression that the researcher correctly predicted which outcomes would be significant.\n\n3. These modifications create a misleading paper trail that makes it appear the researcher had predicted the findings in advance, strengthening the perceived validity of the results.\n\nThis approach is particularly attractive for someone committing misconduct because:\n\n- It's less risky than outright data fabrication\n- It's harder to detect than creating data from scratch\n- It allows the researcher to use mostly real data while still manipulating the conclusions\n- It gives the appearance of methodological rigor through preregistration\n\nThe behavior described—modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection—is precisely what preregistration is designed to prevent, as it constitutes a form of p-hacking.

In genuinely conducted research without misconduct, p-values should follow certain expected distributions.\n\nWhen examining the statistical properties of p-values in legitimate research:\n\n1. If the null hypothesis is true (no real effect), p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means we should see roughly equal numbers of p-values in any equal-sized range (e.g., similar numbers between .04-.05 as between .05-.06).\n\n2. If there are true effects (null hypothesis is false), we'd expect a right-skewed distribution with more very low p-values (e.g., below .01) and progressively fewer as we approach 1.\n\n3. Random chance can create some clustering, but having multiple p-values clustered just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 is statistically suspicious and creates what statisticians call a \"p-value cliff\" at .05.\n\nFor innocent explanations:\n\n1. Publication bias: Researchers might report only analyses that reached significance, but this doesn't explain why there would be no p-values just above .05 in exploratory analyses.\n\n2. Small sample effects: Small samples can produce volatile p-values, but this volatility should work in both directions around .05.\n\n3. Coincidence: By chance, several analyses could fall just below .05, but the probability of multiple analyses falling just below with almost none just above is extremely low.\n\n4. Analysis choices: Legitimate analytical decisions might affect p-values, but these shouldn't systematically push values from just above to just below .05.\n\nThis distribution pattern is well-documented in statistical literature as a red flag for p-hacking or selective reporting. It occurs when researchers conduct multiple analyses or apply different exclusion criteria until achieving significance. The natural statistical distribution of p-values makes this pattern extremely unlikely to occur by chance or through legitimate research practices.\n\nProbability that a researcher not committing misconduct would produce data with an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above: 5"

P-value manipulation: Researchers engaging in misconduct often try various analytical approaches until they find ones that produce \"significant\" results (p < .05).

These specific pressures might not have been present for earlier work.\n\n4. **Skill in misconduct**: Paradoxically, understanding proper documentation and reproducibility provides the knowledge needed to effectively manipulate data. Previous legitimate work might have developed skills later misused.\n\n5. **Different scrutiny levels**: The previous audit may have been less thorough than the current investigation, which was triggered by specific whistleblower concerns. Standard audits often don't detect well-executed misconduct.\n\nThe psychology literature on academic misconduct suggests that situational factors often play a larger role than personality traits in predicting misconduct. Even researchers with strong ethical standards can engage in misconduct under significant pressure, particularly when career outcomes are threatened.\n\nThis pattern of a clean record followed by misconduct is fairly common in academic misconduct cases. Often, the very researchers who previously produced quality work are the ones who face the greatest career pressure and have the most to lose from null results.\n\nProbability that a researcher committing misconduct would have previously passed data audits with well-documented and reproducible work: 70"

    "content": "Excluding participants who report falling asleep or not understanding instructions is standard practice in cognitive neuroscience research. Let me analyze this situation in detail:\n\nFor a researcher conducting ethical research:\n\n1. **Valid exclusion reasons**: Both falling asleep and not understanding instructions are scientifically legitimate reasons for participant exclusion. These problems fundamentally compromise data quality since:\n   - A sleeping participant cannot properly engage with experimental stimuli\n   - A participant who misunderstands instructions isn't performing the intended task\n\n2. **Contemporary documentation**: The notes about these issues appear in the raw data files and predate journal submission. This timing is crucial - it indicates the exclusions were made during normal data processing, not retroactively to achieve desired results.\n\n3. **Transparent process**: Documenting exclusion reasons in the raw data files demonstrates appropriate transparency in the research process.\n\n4. **Small number of exclusions**: Only two participants were excluded for these reasons, which represents a reasonable and expected rate of problematic data collection in cognitive experiments.\n\n5. **Standard practice**: In cognitive neuroscience studies, especially those involving extended periods of attention, it's normal protocol to exclude participants who cannot properly engage with the task.\n\nThese exclusions follow exactly what would be expected in properly conducted research. The contemporaneous documentation is particularly important - it shows the exclusions were made based on observed issues during data collection, rather than outcome-driven decisions made later.\n\nFor a researcher not committing misconduct, this pattern of excluding a small number of participants for well-documented, scientifically valid reasons, with notes made before journal submission, represents standard scientific practice.\n\nProbability that a researcher not committing misconduct would exclude participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, with notes predating submission: 98"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in this study, I need to assess whether these specific exclusions with predating notes would still be likely to appear in her data.\n\nFor a researcher committing misconduct:\n\n1. **Legitimate exclusions alongside misconduct**: Even researchers engaging in some forms of misconduct typically maintain proper protocols for clearly justified exclusions. Falling asleep or not understanding instructions are unambiguous reasons for exclusion that any researcher (ethical or not) would likely document and implement.\n\n2. **Documentation timing**: The contemporaneous nature of these notes (predating journal submission) suggests these particular exclusions were made during normal data processing rather than as part of later manipulation. This timing pattern differs from the suspicious preregistration modifications made after data collection.\n\n3. **Small scope**: These two specific exclusions represent a tiny portion of the overall methodological concerns. A researcher could easily maintain proper documentation for obvious exclusions while still engaging in misconduct elsewhere in the analysis process.\n\n4. **Strategic credibility**: Properly documenting legitimate exclusions helps establish credibility for the overall research process, potentially making other questionable practices less likely to be scrutinized.\n\n5. **Mixed methods**: Research misconduct rarely involves fabricating every aspect of a study. More commonly, researchers combine legitimate methods with problematic ones, making detection more difficult.\n\nThese particular exclusions appear to follow standard scientific practice regardless of other potential misconduct. The proper documentation and clear justification for these specific participants suggest these exclusions would occur whether or not other forms of misconduct were taking place elsewhere in the study.\n\nEven a researcher engaging in p-hacking or selective reporting would still exclude participants who literally fell asleep during the task, as including such data would add noise that could obscure even manipulated effects.\n\nProbability that a researcher committing misconduct would still properly exclude and document participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions: 90"

This is a serious breach of research integrity.\n\n2. **Unusual p-value distribution**: The dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above, a statistical pattern strongly associated with p-hacking.\n\n3. **Participant exclusion patterns**: Earlier analysis scripts included more participants than the final dataset, suggesting potential selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Emails expressing outcome pressure**: Lena's emails indicate pressure for positive results, stating \"a null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\" and \"I need this one to work.\"\n\n**Evidence against misconduct:**\n\n1. **Clean prior record**: Lena's previous studies passed an independent data audit and were rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. **Lab-wide analysis practices**: Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide practice, with other students showing similar patterns.\n\n3. **Technical explanations**: The software switch and confirmed hard drive failure provide plausible explanations for some irregularities.\n\n4. **Appropriate participant exclusions**: Two participants were properly excluded with contemporaneous documentation predating submission.\n\n**Weighing the evidence:**\n\nThe most damaging evidence is the modification of the preregistration after data collection and the unusual p-value distribution, both of which are strongly associated with questionable research practices. These issues are difficult to explain innocently, especially in combination.\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors like her clean prior record and some legitimate technical issues, they don't fully explain the most suspicious patterns in the data. The lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses could actually facilitate p-hacking rather than prevent it if not properly reported.\n\nWhen I balance these factors, the statistical fingerprints of p-hacking combined with the modified preregistration strongly suggest some form of data manipulation occurred in this study.\n\nProbability that Lena committed academic misconduct: 85"
