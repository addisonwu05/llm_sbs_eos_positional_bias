The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Let me explain why:\n\n## Statistical Expectations for P-value Distributions\n\nIn genuine research:\n- P-values should follow a uniform distribution under the null hypothesis\n- If there are true effects, we expect more low p-values (e.g., <.01) but not specifically a clustering just below .05\n- The distribution around the .05 threshold should be relatively smooth, with similar numbers of values just below and just above .05\n\n## Evaluating Innocent Explanations\n\nPossible innocent explanations:\n1. **Random chance**: Extremely unlikely to produce this specific pattern\n2. **Software change**: Would typically affect all analyses equally, not cluster at threshold\n3. **Multiple analyses**: Researchers sometimes run multiple tests but should report all of them\n4. **Data exclusion criteria**: Legitimate exclusions shouldn't specifically target the .05 boundary\n\n## Known Issues in Research Practices\n\nThe described pattern matches a well-documented phenomenon in research called \"p-hacking\" or \"researcher degrees of freedom,\" where analyses are adjusted until results cross the significance threshold. This commonly produces exactly the pattern observed - a clustering just below .05.\n\n## Conclusion and Probability Assessment\n\nThe distribution described is a classic statistical red flag. While not impossible under legitimate research practices, it is extremely unlikely. The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above strongly suggests some form of selective reporting or analysis manipulation.\n\nThe probability that this pattern would emerge naturally if Lena did not engage in questionable research practices is very low.\n\n35"

Here's why:\n\n## Common Forms of Academic Misconduct in Data Analysis\n\n1. **P-hacking**: Researchers who engage in p-hacking typically:\n   - Run multiple analyses with slight variations\n   - Try different exclusion criteria\n   - Add or remove covariates\n   - Transform variables in different ways\n   - Continue until finding a \"significant\" result (p < .05)\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Researchers might conduct many analyses but only report those that achieve statistical significance.\n\n3. **Data Manipulation**: In more extreme cases, researchers might directly alter data points to push results across the significance threshold.\n\n## Expected Statistical Fingerprints of Misconduct\n\nThe pattern described - an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above - is precisely the statistical signature we would expect from misconduct. This pattern has been extensively documented in meta-research as evidence of questionable research practices.\n\n## Research Context Factors\n\nSeveral contextual factors increase the likelihood that this pattern reflects misconduct:\n- High-profile experiment with career implications\n- Pressure from supervisor for publishable results\n- Initial favorable reviews creating incentive to maintain results\n- Multiple suspicious patterns noted by a whistleblower\n\n## Conclusion and Probability Assessment\n\nThe clustering of p-values just below .05 with few above is a classic fingerprint of data manipulation.

Let me analyze the likelihood of these legitimate exclusions:\n\n## Standard Exclusion Practices\n\n1. **Validity Concerns**:\n   - Participants who fall asleep cannot properly engage with cognitive tasks\n   - Those who misunderstand instructions produce data that doesn't measure the intended construct\n   - Both issues fundamentally compromise data validity\n   - These are universally accepted reasons for exclusion across cognitive research\n\n2. **Documentation Timing**:\n   - Notes predating journal submission suggest contemporaneous documentation\n   - This timing indicates exclusions were made during normal data processing\n   - Early documentation reduces likelihood of post-hoc justification\n\n3. **Expected Frequency**:\n   - In cognitive tasks, especially those involving repetitive stimuli or extended duration:\n     - 1-5% of participants typically experience attention lapses or sleep\n     - 2-8% typically have comprehension issues depending on task complexity\n   - Two participants from a sample of 80 (2.5%) falls well within expected ranges\n\n## Documentation Quality Indicators\n\n1. **Transparency Elements**:\n   - Notes in raw data files represent proper documentation\n   - Contemporaneous recording (predating submission) follows best practices\n   - Clear stated reasons align with standard exclusion criteria\n\n2. **Cognitive Neuroscience Context**:\n   - These specific issues (sleep, misunderstanding) are common in attention/memory studies\n   - Documentation of such issues is standard protocol in well-run labs\n   - The proportion of excluded participants is consistent with field norms\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe exclusion of two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, documented in notes predating journal submission, represents standard research practice in cognitive neuroscience. The timing, proportion, and nature of these exclusions all align with legitimate data quality control procedures. There is nothing unusual or suspicious about these particular exclusions or their documentation.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these exclusions would represent normal, expected data quality procedures that any careful researcher would implement.\n\n95"

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n## Legitimate Exclusions Within Questionable Research\n\n1. **Mixed Practice Patterns**:\n   - Researchers who engage in some questionable practices typically also follow many legitimate procedures\n   - Most misconduct occurs selectively rather than comprehensively\n   - Properly documenting obvious exclusions (like sleeping participants) would be standard even for someone otherwise engaging in misconduct\n\n2. **Strategic Documentation**:\n   - Maintaining proper documentation for clear-cut exclusions establishes credibility\n   - Well-documented legitimate exclusions can provide cover for less justifiable manipulations\n   - Someone engaging in misconduct would be especially motivated to document obvious exclusions properly\n\n3. **Risk Management**:\n   - Contemporaneous notes for clearly invalid data points represents low-risk documentation\n   - These particular exclusions are universally accepted and uncontroversial\n   - A researcher committing misconduct elsewhere would still follow standard practices where easily observable\n\n## Contextual Assessment\n\n1. **Proportion Considerations**:\n   - Two participants from 80 (2.5%) is a normal exclusion rate for these reasons\n   - This small proportion wouldn't significantly impact results by itself\n   - Other undocumented or differently-motivated exclusions might have occurred alongside these legitimate ones\n\n2. **Documentation Strategy**:\n   - The pre-submission timing creates a paper trail of good practices\n   - This documentation might coexist with other, less transparent practices\n   - Someone engaging in misconduct would still document obvious exclusion reasons\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proper exclusion and documentation of two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions would be highly likely even if Lena committed misconduct elsewhere in the study. These represent such clear-cut and standard exclusions that almost any researcher would document and implement them regardless of other research practices.\n\nEven researchers who engage in questionable practices typically follow standard protocols for obvious cases like sleeping participants, as these are visible, uncontroversial exclusions that would be noticed and questioned if not addressed properly.\n\n90"

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n## Legitimate Robustness Testing Practices\n\n1. **Multiverse Analysis Approach**:\n   - Modern statistical best practices increasingly recommend testing results across multiple reasonable analytical decisions\n   - \"Multiverse analysis\" and \"specification curve analysis\" are formalized methods for this approach\n   - Exploring how results change under different exclusion criteria directly tests robustness\n   - This approach is explicitly encouraged in recent methodological reforms\n\n2. **Transparency in Analysis**:\n   - Storing all analysis scripts creates an audit trail\n   - Examining stricter and looser criteria helps understand boundary conditions\n   - This practice increases rather than decreases research transparency when properly documented\n\n3. **Lab-Wide Context**:\n   - The lab-wide push for robustness testing suggests a culture of methodological rigor\n   - Similar patterns across students indicate standardized lab practices\n   - This represents structured methodological training rather than individual deviation\n\n## Field-Specific Considerations\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience:\n- Data preprocessing often requires multiple decision points\n- Exploring parameter space is increasingly recognized as necessary\n- Noise levels in neural data make robustness testing particularly important\n\n## Documentation Quality Indicators\n\n1. **Systematic Approach**:\n   - Different exclusion criteria versions suggest systematic exploration\n   - Storage of all versions in accessible logs indicates transparency\n   - Consistency with lab-wide practices suggests methodological standardization\n\n2. **Open Science Movement Influence**:\n   - These practices align with recent methodological reform recommendations\n   - Many labs are implementing similar robustness testing approaches\n   - This pattern matches recommendations in methodological literature\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria, especially as part of a lab-wide practice, strongly aligns with modern methodological best practices for robustness testing. When properly implemented and reported, this approach represents greater scientific rigor rather than questionable practices.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these multiple analyses would represent legitimate robustness testing, consistent with emerging best practices in the field and the lab's methodological standards.\n\n90"

Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n## Multiple Scripts in Context of Misconduct\n\n1. **P-Hacking Under Cover of Robustness Testing**:\n   - Multiple analysis variations provide opportunities to select favorable outcomes\n   - A lab-wide practice of robustness testing creates perfect cover for selective reporting\n   - The scripts themselves would look identical whether used for legitimate testing or p-hacking\n   - Only the selection and reporting process would differ\n\n2. **Blending with Lab Culture**:\n   - Following the lab's script variation practices would help misconduct blend in\n   - Similar patterns across students provides camouflage for questionable practices\n   - Deviating from lab norms would raise more suspicion than conforming\n\n3. **Strategic Documentation**:\n   - Storing all scripts creates appearance of transparency\n   - In misconduct scenarios, researchers often maintain comprehensive records of \"explorations\"\n   - Documentation helps justify post-hoc decision making if questioned\n\n## Detection Avoidance Strategy\n\n1. **Sophisticated Misconduct Patterns**:\n   - Modern research misconduct often works within methodological frameworks\n   - Creating multiple legitimate-looking analyses is more sophisticated than crude data manipulation\n   - This approach produces less obviously problematic data than direct fabrication\n\n2. **Selective Reporting vs. Data Creation**:\n   - Selection from legitimate alternative analyses is harder to detect than fabrication\n   - Each individual analysis could be defensible while the selection process remains hidden\n   - The unusual p-value distribution would result from this selection process\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, running multiple analyses with different criteria would be a highly effective strategy that blends with legitimate lab practices. This approach creates plausible deniability while providing numerous opportunities to find statistically significant results.\n\nThe lab-wide practice creates perfect cover for selective reporting, as running multiple analyses would be expected rather than suspicious. The key difference would be in how the results of these multiple analyses were used and reported, not in their creation and storage.\n\n85"

The most compelling indicators include the unusual clustering of p-values just below significance threshold with few just above, the modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, and the selective participant exclusions that appear to have been made to achieve significant results. While some evidence (like previous good research practices and documented legitimate exclusions) could support innocence, the overall pattern forms a coherent picture of selective reporting and data manipulation that cannot be adequately explained through legitimate research practices or coincidence."
