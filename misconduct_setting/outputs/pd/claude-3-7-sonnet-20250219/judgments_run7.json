  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct. The most compelling evidence includes:\n\n1. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. The statistically suspicious pattern of p-values clustered just below .05 with few just above\n3. The selective exclusion of participants between earlier and final analysis versions\n4. The explicit statements in emails about needing the study to work for her career\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some proper documentation practices, the weight of evidence points strongly toward deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results rather than honest mistakes or technical issues.\n\nYes"
