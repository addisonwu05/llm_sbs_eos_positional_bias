  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe most compelling evidence includes:\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n- The statistically improbable distribution of p-values (clustering just below .05 with almost none just above)\n- Clear motivation established in her emails about needing the study to work\n- The pattern of multiple analysis versions with different exclusion criteria\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her clean prior record and some legitimate exclusions, the statistical anomalies and altered preregistration represent serious methodological violations that are difficult to explain through honest research practices or technical difficulties.\n\nThe totality of evidence suggests deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired results rather than a series of coincidental technical issues or honest mistakes.\n\nYes, I believe Lena committed academic misconduct."
