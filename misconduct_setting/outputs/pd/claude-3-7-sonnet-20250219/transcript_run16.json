The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here's why this pattern is unlikely to occur naturally:\n\n1. In genuine data analysis, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If an effect exists, there should be more low p-values, but the distribution shouldn't sharply change right at 0.05.\n\n2.

This asymmetric clustering around the significance threshold is precisely what we would expect from selective reporting or data manipulation aimed at achieving statistical significance.\n\nThere are some alternative explanations that don't involve misconduct:\n- Extreme coincidence (statistically very unlikely)\n- Publication bias in previous literature leading to biased hypotheses\n- Unintentional researcher degrees of freedom without deliberate p-hacking\n- Selective reporting of analyses without understanding it constitutes questionable research practices\n\nHowever, the specific pattern described - multiple exploratory analyses with p-values clustered just below 0.05 and almost none just above - is highly unusual in honest research.

This pattern is one of the most well-documented statistical signatures of data manipulation in research.\n\nHere's why this pattern strongly suggests misconduct:\n\n1. The 0.05 threshold has become an arbitrary but critical cutoff in science - results below this value are considered \"statistically significant\" and much more likely to be published. This creates a powerful incentive to get p-values just below this threshold.\n\n2. When researchers engage in p-hacking (running multiple analyses and only reporting those that yield significant results), they typically stop once they achieve significance. This creates precisely this pattern - an unusual buildup of p-values just below .05.\n\n3. With genuine data and honest analysis, p-values should distribute more continuously around the threshold. Finding multiple exploratory analyses with p-values like .047, .049, and .041, but almost none just above .05 (like .051 or .052) creates an unnatural \"cliff\" in the distribution.\n\n4. This specific pattern has been identified in large-scale analyses of published literature as a telltale sign of potential misconduct, to the point where some journals now specifically screen for this pattern.\n\nIf Lena were manipulating analyses, selectively reporting, or engaging in other questionable research practices to ensure statistical significance, this is exactly the pattern we would expect to see in her final dataset. The clustering of values just below the significance threshold but not above it is so strongly associated with misconduct that it has become a primary indicator used in forensic data analysis to detect potential fraud.\n\n95"

This is a textbook example of scientific misconduct in the form of p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).\n\nHere's why this behavior strongly aligns with academic misconduct:\n\n1. Strategic advantage: Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data allows a researcher to selectively remove participants whose data doesn't support the hypothesis.

Outcome switching: Changing primary outcomes after data collection allows a researcher to emphasize measures that showed significant effects while downplaying or omitting those that didn't.

Deliberate deception: Unlike some questionable research practices that might result from carelessness, modifying a preregistration document after data collection requires intentional action to change the timestamp or otherwise manipulate the record.\n\n5.

This is standard practice when done transparently.\n\n2. Data quality checks: After initial analysis, researchers might discover issues with certain participants' data (equipment malfunctions, participant inattention) that weren't immediately apparent.\n\n3. Preregistered exclusion rules: If the preregistration included specific exclusion criteria (e.g., performance below a certain threshold, completion time, attention checks), applying these legitimately could result in participant reduction.\n\n4.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her prior record of successfully passing an independent data audit with \"well-documented and reproducible\" ratings would be highly consistent with continued ethical research practices.\n\nHere's why this prior history strongly supports the hypothesis that she maintained proper research practices:\n\n1. Established pattern of integrity: Passing an independent data audit demonstrates that Lena previously adhered to proper research methods and documentation standards. This establishes a baseline of competence and ethical conduct.\n\n2. Skill in reproducible methods: Being specifically rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates Lena possessed the technical skills and methodological understanding to conduct research properly. These skills don't suddenly disappear.\n\n3. Knowledge of proper standards: Successfully navigating an independent audit means Lena was familiar with the standards of proper data management and research documentation, suggesting she would continue to apply this knowledge.\n\n4. Consistent work environment: Since the earlier projects were in the same lab, the research context remained similar, suggesting continuity in research practices rather than a dramatic shift.\n\n5. Psychological consistency: People tend to maintain relatively stable ethical standards over time, particularly in professional contexts where they've been previously recognized for good practices.\n\n6. Risk awareness: Having gone through an audit, Lena would be aware of the scrutiny research can face, potentially making her more cautious about maintaining proper practices, not less.\n\nThis history suggests Lena had both the ability and motivation to conduct research properly. While past behavior doesn't guarantee future conduct, a researcher with a proven track record of reproducible research and no prior irregularities is more likely to continue following proper research practices than to suddenly engage in misconduct.\n\nThe clean audit result and positive evaluation provide significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that Lena maintained her established pattern of proper research conduct.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, her previously clean record with studies that passed an independent audit would still be quite plausible for several reasons:\n\n1. Escalation of behavior: Research misconduct often follows a pattern of escalation, where researchers start with proper methods but gradually adopt questionable practices when facing increased pressure. The high-profile nature and grant implications of the current study might represent such escalated pressure.\n\n2. Situational ethics: Even people with good ethical foundations can make compromises when facing exceptional circumstances. The emails mentioning her supervisor \"counting on this study\" and postdoc prospects suggest this study had unusually high stakes.\n\n3. First-time offending: Many cases of research misconduct represent first-time violations rather than patterns of behavior. The absence of previous issues doesn't preclude the possibility of current misconduct.\n\n4. Learning opportunities: Paradoxically, understanding proper documentation through previous audits could provide knowledge that helps in concealing misconduct later. The earlier audit might have inadvertently taught Lena which aspects of research are scrutinized most carefully.\n\n5. Skill development: Technical proficiency in data management (as evidenced by her \"well-documented and reproducible\" rating) could make her more capable of sophisticated data manipulation that's harder to detect.\n\n6. Changed incentives: The current study appears to have unique career implications (\"null result would kill my chances at a postdoc\") that might not have been present for earlier projects, potentially changing the risk-benefit calculation.\n\n7. Response to failure: Previous studies might have yielded naturally positive results, meaning there was no temptation to engage in misconduct. The current study might represent her first experience with potentially negative findings.\n\nA previously clean record is common among researchers who commit misconduct. Scientific misconduct often involves researchers with otherwise solid reputations who face specific pressures or temptations in particular circumstances rather than habitual rule-breakers.\n\n70"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to evaluate all the evidence systematically:\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. The clustering of p-values just below .05 with very few just above is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking. This pattern is highly unlikely to occur naturally (estimated at 15% likelihood without misconduct vs. 95% likelihood with misconduct).\n\n2. The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and strongly suggests result-driven analysis decisions (10% likelihood without misconduct vs. 95% likelihood with misconduct).\n\n3. Earlier analysis scripts included participants who were later excluded, suggesting potential selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\nMixed/ambiguous evidence:\n\n1. Lena's emails expressing pressure about results are concerning but could represent common career anxiety rather than intent to manipulate data.\n\n2. The multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria match lab-wide practices, making them less suspicious in isolation.\n\n3. Technical issues (software change, hard drive failure) are convenient explanations for missing data but were independently verified.\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n\n1. Two participant exclusions were properly documented with notes predating submission, showing appropriate data management practices.\n\n2. Lena has a clean prior record with studies that passed independent audit and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n3. The lab environment encouraged exploration of robustness with multiple analyses, potentially normalizing what might otherwise look suspicious.\n\nWeighing all factors, the modified preregistration and unusual p-value distribution are particularly damning, as they represent established markers of data manipulation. The software change and hard drive failure, while verified, create convenient gaps in documentation that make verification more difficult.\n\nWhile Lena's prior record suggests ethical research practices, the specific evidence in this case—especially the altered preregistration—points strongly toward misconduct.\n\n75"
