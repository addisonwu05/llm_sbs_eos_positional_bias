The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is because:\n\n1. Changing preregistered exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a classic form of p-hacking - it allows researchers to selectively include/exclude participants until desired results appear.\n\n2. Modifying primary outcomes after data collection enables a researcher to shift focus to whichever measures showed significant results, rather than sticking to the originally planned analyses.\n\n3. These modifications directly undermine the purpose of preregistration, which exists specifically to prevent researchers from making these post-hoc changes.\n\n4. The pressure situation described (high-profile experiment, supervisor needing publishable results for a grant review) creates a clear motivation for such misconduct.\n\n5. The \"too perfect\" results mentioned by the whistleblower align with what might emerge from selectively modifying analyses to produce cleaner findings.\n\n6. The fact that these modifications were detected through file timestamps suggests an attempt to conceal the changes by presenting them as if they were planned before data collection.\n\nThis pattern of behavior - changing analysis plans after seeing results to produce more favorable outcomes - represents one of the most common forms of data manipulation in academic research. If Lena committed misconduct, tampering with the preregistration in this manner would be a logical method to manufacture the positive findings reported in the paper.\n\n90"

If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means we'd expect roughly equal numbers of p-values in each range (e.g., .04-.05, .05-.06, etc.).\n\n2. If there is a genuine effect, p-values tend to be distributed with more values at the lower end, but the distribution would typically be smooth rather than showing sharp discontinuities around arbitrary thresholds like .05.\n\nAn unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost none just above .05 is statistically very improbable without some form of manipulation. This pattern is widely recognized in scientific literature as a red flag for p-hacking - where researchers run multiple analyses or adjust parameters until results cross the significance threshold.\n\nFor this pattern to occur naturally:\n- It would require an extraordinary coincidence where multiple independent analyses all produced results that happened to fall just below .05\n- The sharp drop-off after .05 is particularly unlikely to occur by chance\n\nWhile not impossible, such distributions are so rare in untampered data that they are often used in meta-scientific research specifically to detect publication bias and p-hacking across fields.\n\nThe exploratory nature of these analyses makes this pattern even more suspicious, as exploratory work typically produces more variable results unless selectively reported or manipulated.\n\n10"

The arbitrary .05 threshold is widely used to determine \"statistical significance\" in most fields, including neuroscience. Results just below this threshold get treated as meaningful discoveries, while those just above are considered \"non-significant.\"\n\n2. When researchers engage in misconduct, they often run analyses repeatedly with slight variations (changing exclusion criteria, transformations, covariates, etc.) until the p-value drops below .05.\n\n3. Researchers who manipulate data typically stop modifying their analyses once they achieve \"significance,\" resulting in many p-values clustered just below the threshold.\n\n4. The near-absence of p-values just above .05 is particularly telling - these \"almost significant\" results would typically be abundant in untampered exploratory analyses.\n\n5.

Legitimate and illegitimate exclusions can coexist: A researcher might properly document and exclude clearly problematic participants while still manipulating other aspects of the data or analysis.\n\n3. Contemporaneous documentation provides credibility: Having proper documentation for some exclusions helps establish an appearance of rigorous methods, which can make other questionable practices less likely to be scrutinized.\n\n4. Small numbers of well-documented exclusions are expected: Even in fabricated or manipulated research, including a realistic number of routine exclusions with proper documentation would be part of creating a convincing dataset.\n\n5. These specific issues are objectively verifiable: Unlike subjective exclusion criteria that might be manipulated, participants self-reporting falling asleep or not understanding instructions are clear-cut cases that would be documented in real time.\n\nEven if Lena committed misconduct in other aspects of the research, the proper documentation and handling of these specific participant issues would be expected as part of maintaining basic research standards and creating a dataset that appears legitimate overall.\n\n85"

    "content": "To evaluate the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to carefully weigh all the evidence presented.\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n1. The preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, undermining the purpose of preregistration.\n2. The final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) with almost no p-values just above .05 for exploratory analyses - a classic signature of p-hacking.\n3. Lena's emails expressing that her supervisor was \"counting on this study to save the grant\" and that she \"needs this one to work\" reveal significant outcome-oriented pressure.\n4. An earlier analysis script included additional participants who were later excluded from the final dataset, suggesting possible selective removal of unhelpful data.\n5. The modified preregistration aligns suspiciously with these participant exclusions.\n\nEvidence against misconduct or providing alternative explanations:\n1. Lena has no prior record of data irregularities; previous projects passed independent audits with \"well-documented and reproducible\" ratings.\n2. The lab switched statistical software packages mid-project, which could explain some inconsistencies.\n3. Lena experienced a verified hard drive failure that led to missing files, confirmed by IT.\n4. The lab's data management logs show all researchers, not just Lena, ran multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness initiative.\n5. Two excluded participants had legitimate documentation predating journal submission about falling asleep or not understanding instructions.\n\nConsidering all factors, the most damning evidence is the unusual distribution of p-values just below .05 combined with the post-data-collection modification of the preregistration. These are difficult to explain innocently and strongly suggest deliberate p-hacking. The emails provide clear motive.\n\nWhile technical issues and lab practices offer some alternative explanations for certain irregularities, they cannot adequately explain the p-value distribution, which is a statistical fingerprint of selective analysis.\n\n75"

The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a statistical anomaly that strongly indicates p-hacking. This, combined with the modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria, suggests deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results. Lena's emails provide clear motivation for such actions, establishing both means and motive for misconduct. These core issues cannot be adequately explained by the technical difficulties or standard research practices described in the case."
