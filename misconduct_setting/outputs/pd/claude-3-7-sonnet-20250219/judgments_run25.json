  "Based on the evidence presented, I believe Lena did commit academic misconduct. The most compelling evidence includes:\n\n1. The modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n2. The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none above this threshold\n3. The pattern of participant exclusions between early and final analyses\n4. Her emails indicating clear pressure and motivation to produce significant results\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate explanations for certain anomalies, the statistical patterns and particularly the modified preregistration strongly suggest deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes rather than honest reporting of results.\n\nThe preregistration modification is especially significant as it represents a fundamental violation of research integrity that cannot be easily explained through innocent means.\n\nYes"
