  "Based on the evidence presented, my assessment is: Yes, Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe pattern of evidence strongly points toward deliberate data manipulation rather than honest mistakes. The modified preregistration after data collection, suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none above, selective participant exclusion, and explicitly stated motivation about needing the study to \"work\" for her career form a coherent pattern consistent with misconduct.\n\nWhile there are some mitigating factors like her previously clean record and some legitimate explanations for certain actions, the overall evidence pattern—particularly the modified preregistration and the statistically improbable distribution of p-values—is difficult to explain through innocent means alone.\n\nThe combination of clear motive, opportunity, and multiple statistical irregularities that all point in the direction of achieving significant results suggests deliberate manipulation rather than coincidence or honest error."
