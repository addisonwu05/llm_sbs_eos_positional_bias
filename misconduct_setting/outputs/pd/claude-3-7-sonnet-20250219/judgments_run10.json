  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, I believe the answer is:\n\nYes\n\nThe modified preregistration document after data collection, the statistically improbable distribution of p-values clustered just below .05, the pattern of participant exclusions between analysis versions, and the emails expressing result-oriented pressure collectively create a compelling case that Lena engaged in p-hacking or data manipulation to achieve significant results. While some alternative explanations exist for individual pieces of evidence, the overall pattern strongly suggests deliberate misconduct rather than a series of innocent coincidences or honest errors."
