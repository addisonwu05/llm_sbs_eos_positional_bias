The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I'll analyze the likelihood of having participants excluded from the final dataset if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nIn legitimate research, there are several valid reasons why participants might be excluded between an earlier analysis and the final analysis:\n\n1. Exclusion criteria applied after initial data collection: Researchers often set predetermined exclusion criteria (like attention check failures, incomplete responses, or outlier detection) that are applied systematically after data collection.\n\n2. Data quality issues discovered during analysis: During data processing, researchers might identify participants who misunderstood instructions, experienced technical problems, or provided unusable data.\n\n3. Reviewer suggestions: After initial submission or during pre-registration review, reviewers may suggest more stringent exclusion criteria that better align with methodological standards.\n\n4. Power analyses: After preliminary analysis, researchers might realize they need fewer participants than initially collected to achieve adequate statistical power.\n\n5. Protocol violations identified after initial analysis: Some participants might have been found to deviate from the experimental protocol in ways not immediately apparent.\n\nIn cognitive neuroscience specifically, participant exclusion is quite common due to:\n- Movement artifacts in brain imaging data\n- Poor task performance indicating lack of engagement\n- Equipment malfunctions during data collection\n- Participants not meeting inclusion criteria that could only be verified during testing\n\nThe fact that the lab switched software recently could explain why the exclusion criteria might appear in later but not earlier scripts, as the implementation method might have changed.\n\nBased on standard research practices in cognitive neuroscience, participant exclusion between analysis versions is extremely common and often necessary for methodological rigor. Without any evidence suggesting the exclusions were done to manipulate results, this would be considered normal scientific practice.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

Here's why:\n\n1. P-hacking and data manipulation: One of the most common forms of academic misconduct involves selectively removing participants whose data don't support the desired hypothesis. By trying different combinations of participant exclusions, a researcher can artificially achieve statistical significance.\n\n2. Post-hoc criteria creation: A researcher engaging in misconduct might remove participants based on criteria developed after seeing the results, rather than using pre-established exclusion rules.\n\n3. Strategic outlier removal: Removing \"inconvenient\" data points that weaken the desired effect while keeping equally extreme outliers that strengthen it is a form of data manipulation.\n\n4. Undisclosed multiple analyses: Running many analyses with different participant subsets but only reporting the \"successful\" ones constitutes misconduct.\n\n5. The whistleblower claim that some data \"look too perfect\" aligns with the possibility that Lena selectively removed participants whose data created messier patterns.\n\n6. The timeline is suspicious - changing analyses after reviewer comments without transparency suggests potential data manipulation to satisfy reviewers.\n\n7. The high-pressure environment with Professor Mills needing publishable results before a grant review provides a clear motive for data manipulation.\n\nWhen data manipulation occurs, there is almost always evidence of participant exclusion between analysis versions. It's one of the most direct methods to produce cleaner, more significant results.

Let me analyze the likelihood of this happening without academic misconduct:\n\n1. Legitimate modifications to preregistration are possible, but they should be:\n   - Transparently documented with clear rationales\n   - Clearly labeled as post-hoc changes\n   - Not driven by knowledge of results\n\n2. Innocent explanations could include:\n   - Administrative errors (updating the wrong file)\n   - Technical issues during initial submission (needing to fix incomplete uploads)\n   - Clarifying ambiguous criteria without substantively changing them\n\n3. However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically after seeing the data is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of preregistration, which exists to prevent researcher degrees of freedom and p-hacking.\n\n4. In proper research practice, changes after data collection would typically:\n   - Be documented in a separate amendment\n   - Be analyzed as exploratory rather than confirmatory\n   - Be explicitly acknowledged in the final paper\n\n5. The field of cognitive neuroscience increasingly emphasizes preregistration integrity, making such changes without proper documentation unusual for a third-year PhD student who should understand basic research integrity principles.\n\n6. Even if done without fraudulent intent, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection shows either:\n   - Severe misunderstanding of research methods\n   - Carelessness about research integrity\n   - Improper research training\n\nWhile honest mistakes happen, modifying these specific elements of preregistration after data collection without proper documentation is extremely difficult to explain as an innocent error, particularly for someone at Lena's level of training. The probability that this would happen without any misconduct intention is quite low.\n\nProbability judgment: 15"

Here's why:\n\n1. Changing preregistered exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a textbook example of p-hacking - it allows researchers to selectively remove participants whose data don't support the desired conclusion while maintaining the appearance of methodological rigor.\n\n2. Modifying primary outcomes after data collection enables HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) - allowing researchers to claim they predicted effects that were actually discovered during exploratory analysis.\n\n3. These specific modifications directly undermine the two main purposes of preregistration: preventing selective reporting and constraining researcher degrees of freedom.\n\n4. The timing is particularly damning - making these changes after data collection strongly suggests they were informed by the results, allowing Lena to craft criteria that would yield \"clean\" significant findings.\n\n5. The high-stakes context (pressure from Professor Mills for publishable results before a grant review) provides clear motivation for such manipulation.\n\n6. These actions align perfectly with the whistleblower's claim that results \"look too perfect\" - retroactively changing exclusion criteria is precisely how researchers can engineer suspiciously clean results.\n\n7. In cases of proven academic misconduct, preregistration tampering is one of the most common forms of evidence discovered during investigations.\n\n8. The combination of changing both exclusion criteria AND primary outcomes suggests systematic rather than isolated manipulation.\n\n9. Modifying these elements without transparent disclosure represents a deliberate attempt to mislead readers and reviewers about the confirmatory versus exploratory nature of the findings.\n\nThis behavior represents one of the clearest indicators of intentional research fraud, as it demonstrates knowledge of proper scientific practices (by preregistering in the first place) combined with deliberate subversion of those practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

Natural p-value distributions in research:\n   - When analyzing genuine data, p-values should distribute relatively uniformly if the null hypothesis is true\n   - If there are true effects, we'd expect to see more very low p-values (e.g., p < .01), but not a specific clustering just below .05\n   - The absence of p-values just above .05 creates an unnatural \"cliff\" in the distribution\n\n2.

Potential legitimate explanations:\n   - Small sample statistical flukes are possible but extremely unlikely across multiple analyses\n   - Certain specialized statistical corrections might affect p-value distributions, but would rarely create this specific pattern\n   - Some fields have built-in publication bias that could theoretically affect exploratory analyses, but this wouldn't explain the absence of values above .05\n\n4.

This distribution represents one of the most reliable statistical fingerprints of p-hacking. Here's why:\n\n1. This pattern perfectly matches known p-hacking behaviors:\n   - Researchers who manipulate analyses stop when they reach statistical significance\n   - The conventional significance threshold of p < .05 serves as the \"finish line\"\n   - Once a p-value drops below .05, further manipulation typically ceases\n\n2. The specific mechanics of p-hacking produce exactly this distribution:\n   - When researchers try multiple analysis approaches, they select those yielding p < .05\n   - Results with p-values just above .05 are either discarded or further manipulated\n   - This creates an artificial \"cliff\" at precisely the .05 threshold\n\n3. Scientific literature on publication bias shows this pattern as diagnostic:\n   - Meta-analyses across disciplines identify this \"p-curve discontinuity\" as evidence of manipulation\n   - Statistical studies show this pattern is virtually impossible without selective reporting or data manipulation\n   - The absence of p-values between .05 and .10 creates an unnatural \"gap\" in the distribution\n\n4.

Software switches during ongoing projects are relatively common:\n   - Labs frequently update software for improved features or compatibility\n   - Institutional licenses may change, requiring transitions between packages\n   - New analysis techniques may become available, prompting software changes\n   - Software transitions often occur as field standards evolve\n\n2. Hard drive failures are a routine technical issue:\n   - The average annual failure rate for hard drives ranges from 2-9% depending on make and usage\n   - Academic laptops often face heavy use, increasing failure likelihood\n   - The confirmation from IT provides objective verification of the hardware issue\n   - This represents independent corroboration from a third party not invested in the research outcomes\n\n3. The timing context is important:\n   - These events occur commonly in research settings regardless of misconduct\n   - Their coincidental occurrence during a project is not particularly unusual\n   - Long-term research projects have a higher probability of encountering such issues\n\n4. File loss during technical transitions is expected:\n   - Software migrations often result in compatibility issues and file conversion problems\n   - Hard drive failures typically result in some data loss despite backup attempts\n   - The combination of these events would compound file management challenges\n\n5. The specificity of the account adds credibility:\n   - The hardware failure was formally reported and addressed by IT\n   - The repair record provides a timestamp that can be independently verified\n   - This type of documentation would be difficult to fabricate convincingly\n\n6. From a probability perspective:\n   - Both events (software change and hard drive failure) are relatively common independently\n   - Their co-occurrence during a multi-year PhD project is not particularly improbable\n   - Research labs regularly face technical challenges that impact data management\n\nThese technical difficulties represent normal challenges in research environments. The independent verification from IT provides important context that substantiates the hardware failure claim, making this explanation highly plausible.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the software switch and hard drive failure could still occur independently of her misconduct. Let me analyze this scenario:\n\n1. Technical issues occur regardless of research integrity:\n   - Software changes and hardware failures happen at similar rates in all research environments\n   - These events would occur with similar probability whether or not misconduct took place\n   - The IT department's confirmation of the hardware failure provides objective evidence that this event genuinely occurred\n\n2. From a misconduct perspective, these events could be opportunistic:\n   - Technical disruptions can provide convenient explanations for inconsistencies in data or analysis\n   - Someone engaging in misconduct might leverage legitimate technical problems to explain discrepancies\n   - The timing could be coincidental but advantageous for obscuring questionable research practices\n\n3. The probability calculation needs to consider:\n   - Base rates of these technical issues (relatively common)\n   - Independence of these events from research conduct (largely independent)\n   - The potential utility of these events as cover (potentially high)\n\n4. Hard drive failures specifically:\n   - The confirmed repair record establishes this as a genuine event\n   - Hard drives fail at similar rates regardless of user behavior\n   - This aspect is likely independent of any research misconduct\n\n5. Software transitions:\n   - Lab-wide software changes are typically decided at a group level\n   - Such transitions are common and often outside an individual researcher's control\n   - This event is also largely independent of individual misconduct\n\n6. The missing files:\n   - While the hardware failure is confirmed, the specific files that were lost might be selective\n   - Someone engaging in misconduct might be selective in what they attempt to recover\n   - The failure provides a plausible explanation for strategic gaps in documentation\n\nThese technical events would likely occur at similar rates regardless of Lena's research conduct. The hardware failure in particular has independent verification. The key difference in a misconduct scenario would be how these events might be leveraged to explain inconsistencies or gaps in research records, not the probability of the events themselves occurring.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her previous studies passing an independent data audit with high ratings for documentation and reproducibility would be highly consistent with that scenario. Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Past research conduct is a strong predictor of present conduct:\n   - Research practices tend to be habitual and consistent across projects\n   - Skills like data documentation and organization typically transfer between studies\n   - The methodological rigor that produces well-documented research is usually a stable trait\n\n2. The nature of the prior audit is significant:\n   - An independent audit represents external validation, not self-assessment\n   - \"Well-documented and reproducible\" indicates high-quality research practices\n   - Passing such an audit demonstrates technical competence and attention to detail\n\n3. The specific praise for documentation and reproducibility is particularly relevant:\n   - These qualities directly contradict the current concerns about data irregularities\n   - They suggest established habits of careful data management\n   - They indicate transparency in research methods, counteracting suspicions of deliberate obfuscation\n\n4. From a behavioral consistency perspective:\n   - Developing proper research habits requires significant effort and training\n   - Once established, these habits typically persist across projects\n   - Dramatic changes in research practice quality would be unusual without external factors\n\n5. The timeline matters:\n   - The audit was conducted just a year prior to the current study\n   - This recent validation suggests Lena's research practices were sound in the recent past\n   - Such a short timeframe makes dramatic changes in research integrity less likely\n\n6. From a cognitive perspective:\n   - Researchers who understand and value reproducibility (as evidenced by the prior audit)\n   - Are more likely to maintain those standards in subsequent work\n   - Show awareness of proper scientific conduct that would make misconduct less likely\n\nA clean prior record with independent verification of research quality strongly suggests consistent research practices. The specific praise for documentation and reproducibility directly addresses the skills relevant to the current investigation.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct in the current study, her previous studies passing an independent audit with high marks for documentation and reproducibility presents an interesting analytical challenge. Let me examine this scenario:\n\n1. Research misconduct often follows a progression rather than appearing suddenly:\n   - First instances of misconduct are typically preceded by a history of proper research\n   - Many researchers who engage in misconduct have previously conducted legitimate work\n   - The transition from proper to improper practices often occurs gradually\n\n2. Situational factors can trigger new behaviors:\n   - The described high-pressure context (\"save the grant,\" postdoc concerns) may represent new pressures\n   - The stakes for this particular study appear unusually high compared to typical projects\n   - These unique circumstances could prompt unprecedented behaviors\n\n3. From a forensic psychology perspective:\n   - First-time misconduct often occurs under specific stressors not present in previous work\n   - The \"slippery slope\" phenomenon is well-documented in research ethics\n   - Clean prior records are common among researchers later found to have committed misconduct\n\n4. The context of the previous audit matters:\n   - Different studies have different challenges and temptations\n   - Previous studies may have produced favorable results naturally, requiring no manipulation\n   - The audit occurred before the high-pressure circumstances described in Lena's emails\n\n5. From a risk-benefit perspective:\n   - Previous studies may not have had the same career implications as the current one\n   - The specific pressure regarding grant renewal and postdoc prospects creates unique incentives\n   - The cost-benefit analysis for misconduct would be different across projects\n\n6. Technical skill consideration:\n   - Good documentation skills and understanding of reproducibility are technically necessary for sophisticated misconduct\n   - Knowledge of proper practices can enable more convincing manipulation\n   - The skills that make someone a good researcher can also facilitate more effective misconduct when motivations change\n\nIt's quite plausible that Lena conducted her previous research with integrity while succumbing to pressures in this specific high-stakes situation. A clean prior record doesn't preclude current misconduct, particularly when circumstances change dramatically.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

Modified preregistration document after data collection, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes (highly problematic research practice)\n\n2. Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 in exploratory analyses (a statistical pattern strongly associated with p-hacking)\n\n3. Emails expressing pressure that \"supervisor was counting on this study,\" that \"a null result would kill postdoc chances,\" and that she \"needs this one to work\" (establishes motivation)\n\n4. Whistleblower claim that data \"looks too perfect\" (external assessment raising concerns)\n\n5. Multiple analysis scripts with different participant exclusion criteria (potential means for p-hacking)\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n\n1. Clean prior record with independent audit rating previous work as \"well-documented and reproducible\" (established history of integrity)\n\n2. Legitimate exclusion of two participants who fell asleep/didn't understand instructions, with contemporaneous documentation (proper research practice)\n\n3. Confirmed technical issues: software change mid-project and verified hard drive failure (explains some inconsistencies)\n\n4. Lab-wide practice of running multiple analyses for robustness checks, similar to other students (institutional context)\n\nWeighing these factors:\n\nThe most concerning evidence is the modified preregistration after data collection and the statistically improbable p-value distribution. These represent serious methodological red flags that are difficult to explain through legitimate research practices. The emails establish clear motivation, though they don't directly prove misconduct.\n\nThe strongest counter-evidence is her previously clean record and the proper documentation of some participant exclusions. However, these don't directly address the specific irregularities in this study.\n\nThe technical issues and multiple analysis scripts are somewhat neutral - they provide plausible explanations for some irregularities but could also serve as convenient cover.\n\nConsidering all evidence holistically, there are multiple serious indicators of misconduct that outweigh the mitigating factors.\n\nProbability judgment: 75"
