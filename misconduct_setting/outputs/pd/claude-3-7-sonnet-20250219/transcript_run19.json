The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Many researchers privately express such sentiments without crossing ethical lines.\n\nThese statements reflect real pressures in academic science that researchers frequently discuss. A PhD student might naturally express these concerns to a friend while still conducting honest research.

Pressure and rationalization: Researchers who commit misconduct often do so under perceived pressure. These emails document precisely the types of pressure that could lead someone to rationalize misconduct - career anxiety, supervisor expectations, and grant contingencies. People who falsify data often convince themselves they're doing it for understandable reasons.\n\n2. Establishing a narrative: Someone contemplating or engaging in misconduct might discuss these pressures with others to lay groundwork for explaining their behavior or to subtly justify future actions. The emails create a narrative of extreme pressure that could later serve as an implicit explanation.\n\n3. Psychological consistency: People generally prefer their actions to align with their stated values and concerns. Having expressed these worries, Lena might feel more justified in taking steps to \"make it work\" through improper means.\n\n4. Documentation of motive: These emails explicitly document motivation for potential misconduct. The language \"needs this one to work\" is particularly telling as it focuses on the outcome rather than the scientific process.\n\nAcademic misconduct typically occurs within a context of pressure, and Lena's emails articulate precisely the pressures associated with data falsification in research. These statements would be highly consistent with the mindset of someone who later commits misconduct to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nProbability: 85"

Natural distribution: In genuine research without selective reporting or p-hacking, p-values should follow a relatively smooth distribution. If the null hypothesis is true, p-values should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If there are true effects, we'd expect a right-skewed distribution with more low p-values, but the transition would be gradual without sharp discontinuities at .05.\n\n2. The \"cliff\" at .05: The described pattern shows a suspicious discontinuity exactly at the conventional significance threshold of .05. This \"cliff\" pattern, where values just below .05 are common but values just above .05 are rare, is widely recognized in meta-scientific research as a red flag for selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\n3. Multiple exploratory analyses: Having this pattern across several exploratory analyses compounds the statistical unlikelihood. Exploratory analyses in particular should show a more random distribution of p-values.\n\n4. Mathematical probability: The chance of multiple independent tests naturally producing this clustered pattern just below the significance threshold is extremely low. The exact probability depends on the specific number of tests and their distribution, but generally, this pattern is highly improbable through chance alone.\n\nStatisticians and meta-scientists have extensively documented that this specific pattern is a strong indicator of data manipulation, selective reporting, or p-hacking. While not impossible in honest research, it is exceedingly unlikely without some form of data manipulation.\n\nProbability: 10"

P-hacking signature: This distribution precisely matches what occurs when researchers engage in p-hacking: running multiple analyses, applying various data transformations, selectively including/excluding outliers, or adding participants until reaching statistical significance. These practices specifically push borderline results from just above .05 to just below it.\n\n2. Motivated stopping: Researchers engaging in misconduct often stop collecting data or trying analysis variations once they achieve p < .05, creating exactly this clustering effect just below the threshold.\n\n3. Statistical evidence: Meta-science research has established this \"p-curve discontinuity\" as one of the strongest statistical indicators of questionable research practices. Multiple scientific investigations examining published literature have identified this pattern as highly indicative of manipulation.\n\n4. Exploratory analyses vulnerability: Exploratory analyses are particularly susceptible to p-hacking because they lack pre-registered hypotheses and analysis plans. The fact that this pattern appears in several exploratory analyses makes it even more consistent with misconduct.\n\n5. Selective reporting: Even if data weren't fabricated, selectively reporting only analyses that \"worked\" (p < .05) creates this exact pattern and constitutes a form of misconduct.\n\nThis specific statistical anomaly is so strongly associated with data manipulation that it has become a primary tool for detecting misconduct in scientific literature.

The core purpose is to distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses by documenting analysis plans before seeing the data. Changing preregistered exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection directly undermines this purpose.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. Definitional issue: Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is, by most definitions in scientific ethics, a form of misconduct itself. The very purpose of preregistration is to prevent such post-hoc changes.\n\n2. Legitimate scenarios: There are extremely limited circumstances where modifications might be justified:\n   - Correcting genuine clerical errors in the original document\n   - Responding to unforeseen technical issues that make the original plan impossible\n   - Documenting deviations transparently as exploratory rather than confirmatory\n\n3. Proper procedure: Even in these rare cases, ethical practice requires:\n   - Maintaining the original preregistration\n   - Documenting changes transparently\n   - Acknowledging the exploratory nature of modified analyses\n   - Not claiming preregistered status for the modified analyses\n\n4. Timestamp evidence: The file timestamps provide objective evidence that changes were made after data collection, eliminating the possibility this was proper preregistration.\n\nFor this not to constitute misconduct, Lena would need to have:\n- Made the changes for legitimate reasons\n- Documented them transparently\n- Not presented post-hoc analyses as preregistered\n- Reported results from the original plan alongside any modifications\n\nGiven that the scenario describes changing \"exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\" specifically (the elements most likely to affect statistical significance), without mentioning any transparent documentation, the likelihood this was done without misconduct is extremely low.\n\nProbability: 5"

Strategic advantage: Changing exclusion criteria after seeing data allows a researcher to selectively remove participants whose data don't support the hypothesis while keeping those who do. Similarly, changing primary outcomes allows one to elevate previously secondary measures that showed significance while downplaying original primary outcomes that didn't show effects.\n\n2. Perfect mechanism for p-hacking: This specific form of misconduct provides exactly the tools needed to generate the suspicious pattern of p-values observed (many just below .05, few just above). By adjusting which participants count and which outcomes matter, a researcher can directly manipulate p-values.\n\n3. Common misconduct pattern: Research on scientific fraud has identified post-hoc modification of preregistered plans as one of the most common forms of intentional misconduct. It represents a deliberate attempt to present exploratory or manipulated findings as if they were confirmatory.\n\n4. Concealment attempt: The fact that the changes were made to the original document rather than filed as transparent amendments suggests an attempt to conceal the modifications, consistent with knowing misconduct.\n\n5. Temporal sequence: The timing - making changes after data collection - eliminates benign explanations and demonstrates the changes were responsive to the observed results rather than methodological necessities.\n\nIf Lena was engaging in misconduct to produce significant results, modifying the preregistration would be an extremely effective and logical strategy.

Standard exclusion criteria: Researchers routinely exclude participants for valid methodological reasons:\n   - Failure to follow instructions or complete the experiment\n   - Technical issues during data collection\n   - Performance indicating lack of attention (e.g., accuracy below chance)\n   - Clear outliers identified by standard statistical methods\n   - Participants who don't meet inclusion criteria that were missed initially\n\n2. Data cleaning processes: Initial analyses often include all participants before proper screening is applied. The normal workflow involves:\n   - Running preliminary analyses on all data\n   - Applying predetermined exclusion criteria\n   - Removing invalid data points based on objective standards\n   - Documenting exclusions transparently\n\n3. Appropriate timing: Finding issues with participants during data analysis is common in research. What matters is whether:\n   - The exclusions followed preregistered criteria\n   - The process was documented transparently\n   - The decisions weren't influenced by how they affected the hypothesis\n\n4. Technical explanations: The scenario mentions software changes and a hard drive failure, which could explain why exclusions might appear between versions if data needed to be reprocessed or criteria reapplied.\n\nWithout knowing the specific reasons for the exclusions, we can't determine if they were appropriate. If the exclusions followed predetermined criteria and weren't selectively applied to achieve significance, this pattern would be consistent with normal research practices.\n\nHowever, considering the other concerning elements in this case (modified preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution), the exclusions become more questionable, though still possibly legitimate if properly justified and documented.\n\nProbability: 50"

Strategic participant selection: If committing misconduct, selectively removing participants whose data don't support the hypothesis while retaining those who do is one of the most direct ways to manufacture significant results. This technique allows a researcher to:\n   - Eliminate data points that weaken desired effects\n   - Preserve data points that strengthen desired effects\n   - Create statistical significance that wasn't originally present\n\n2.

Convenient timing considerations:\n   - While these events could provide cover for misconduct, their objective verification makes them less suspicious\n   - The software switch affected the entire lab, making it an unlikely fabrication\n   - The IT department's confirmation of the hard drive failure establishes its legitimacy\n\n4. File loss as opportunity:\n   - A researcher engaging in misconduct might opportunistically use these legitimate events to explain missing files or inconsistencies\n   - However, the events themselves would still be genuine occurrences\n   - The convenient timing doesn't make the events less likely to have occurred\n\nThese technical issues represent normal research challenges that would occur at similar rates regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing fraud might capitalize on these legitimate complications as explanations, but wouldn't necessarily cause them. The independent verification particularly supports that these were genuine events, even if they were later leveraged as explanations for irregularities.\n\nProbability: 80"

Robustness testing is methodologically sound:\n   - Testing whether results hold under different analytical decisions is considered best practice\n   - \"Multiverse\" or \"specification curve\" analyses that systematically vary parameters are increasingly recommended\n   - Exploring how different exclusion criteria affect results helps establish finding reliability\n   - This approach acknowledges the inherent subjectivity in some analytical choices\n\n2. Lab-wide initiative context:\n   - The fact this was a \"lab-wide push\" provides institutional context\n   - This suggests the approach was encouraged by supervisors or lab policies\n   - The similar patterns in other students' scripts confirms this was standard practice\n   - This establishes that Lena was following lab protocols rather than acting unusually\n\n3. Transparency in data management:\n   - The scripts being properly logged in the lab's data management system indicates transparency\n   - Properly documenting multiple analyses is the opposite of concealment\n   - This systematic storage suggests organized exploration rather than selective reporting\n   - The documentation creates accountability for all analyses run\n\n4. Methodological thoroughness:\n   - Exploring both stricter and looser criteria shows methodological balance\n   - This suggests genuine interest in understanding the data, not just finding significance\n   - The comprehensive approach indicates scientific rigor\n   - This pattern demonstrates methodological thoughtfulness\n\nIf Lena was not committing misconduct, this pattern perfectly aligns with transparent, thorough analytical practices. The lab-wide nature of the approach and the proper documentation of all analyses in the data management system are particularly indicative of legitimate research practices aimed at ensuring robust, reliable findings.\n\nProbability: 95"

P-hacking mechanism: Multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria provide the perfect mechanism for p-hacking:\n   - Running numerous variations allows selecting the version that produces desired results\n   - Trying both stricter and looser criteria maximizes chances of finding significant outcomes\n   - This approach enables \"researcher degrees of freedom\" that can be exploited\n   - The presence of these scripts directly explains the suspicious p-value distribution noted earlier\n\n2. Camouflage within legitimate practices:\n   - A lab-wide robustness initiative provides perfect cover for questionable practices\n   - Similar patterns among students makes Lena's multiple analyses appear normal\n   - The legitimate methodological justification makes detection more difficult\n   - This context allows representing p-hacking as thoroughness\n\n3. Strategic documentation:\n   - Storing all scripts creates an appearance of transparency\n   - Having documentation for all analyses provides justification if questioned\n   - The lab-wide system makes selective reporting less obvious\n   - This approach allows presenting the selected analysis as just one of many legitimate options\n\n4. Selective reporting pathway:\n   - Multiple analyses enable choosing which results to emphasize in the final paper\n   - The researcher can run many versions but only report those supporting the hypothesis\n   - Having various exclusion criteria creates flexibility in shaping the final dataset\n   - This directly enables the suspicious pattern of p-values just below .05\n\nThis pattern is entirely consistent with sophisticated misconduct that leverages legitimate methodological practices as cover. A researcher intent on finding significant results would likely run multiple analyses with varying criteria, especially in an environment where such exploration was encouraged and normalized.\n\nProbability: 90"

    "content": "I'll analyze the totality of evidence to assess the probability of academic misconduct.\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. P-value distribution: The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 is a classic statistical fingerprint of p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally (estimated 10% probability without misconduct, 95% probability with misconduct).\n\n2. Modified preregistration: The preregistration document was changed after data collection to alter exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a serious violation of research integrity (estimated 5% probability without misconduct, 95% probability with misconduct).\n\n3. Participant exclusion: An earlier analysis script showed additional participants who were later excluded. While some exclusions are legitimate, this pattern aligns with selective removal to achieve desired results.\n\n4. Pressure and motivation: Lena's emails expressed strong outcome-focused pressure (\"need this one to work\"), establishing clear motivation for potential misconduct.\n\nEvidence suggesting proper conduct:\n\n1. Previous audit success: Lena's earlier work passed independent data audits with high ratings for documentation and reproducibility.\n\n2. Legitimate exclusions: Two participants were excluded based on contemporaneous notes documenting valid reasons (sleeping, not understanding instructions).\n\n3. Technical explanations: Software changes and verified hard drive failure provide plausible explanations for some documentation issues.\n\n4. Lab-wide practices: Multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative, with other students showing similar patterns.\n\nWeighing these factors, the modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution are particularly damning, as they directly indicate manipulation of analyses after seeing results. While there are some mitigating factors, the statistical anomalies and altered preregistration strongly suggest intentional manipulation of results to achieve significance.\n\nProbability: 85"
