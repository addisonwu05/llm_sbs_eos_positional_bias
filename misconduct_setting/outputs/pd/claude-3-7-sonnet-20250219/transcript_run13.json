The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Here's why:\n\n1. Selective participant exclusion is one of the most common and effective methods of p-hacking. By removing participants whose data don't support the hypothesis while keeping those that do, researchers can artificially strengthen statistical results.\n\n2. This approach is particularly effective because it can be disguised as legitimate data cleaning. Unlike fabricating data entirely (which risks obvious statistical anomalies), selectively excluding \"problematic\" participants is more subtle and harder to detect.\n\n3. The pattern aligns perfectly with the other evidence: the modified preregistration (potentially to retroactively justify these exclusions), and the suspicious clustering of p-values just below .05 (which could result from these strategic exclusions).\n\n4. If Lena were facing pressure to produce positive results for a high-profile experiment before a grant review, selective participant exclusion offers a lower-risk method of manipulating data compared to outright fabrication.\n\n5. The fact that the earlier version was only found in an automated backup suggests these changes weren't transparently documented, which would be expected if the exclusions were made with questionable intent.\n\n6. In cases of confirmed academic misconduct, retrospective analyses frequently reveal this exact pattern - initial analyses with all participants showing weaker or null effects, followed by strategic exclusions to produce significant results.\n\nIf Lena were deliberately manipulating data to achieve significant results, selectively excluding participants whose data weakened the desired effect would be an expected, almost inevitable part of that process.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

Consistent with peers: The observation that \"other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts\" indicates that Lena's approach aligned with lab norms rather than being unusual or suspicious.\n\n4. Transparency: Storing these alternative scripts in the lab's data management system demonstrates transparency. Had Lena intended to p-hack, hiding these explorations would make more sense than documenting them in shared logs.\n\n5. Open science practices: In recent years, robustness checks have become increasingly valued in cognitive neuroscience as part of open science reforms. This lab-wide initiative appears to reflect adoption of improved methodological standards.\n\n6. Educational value: For PhD students, exploring how different analytical choices affect results has pedagogical value in understanding statistical methods and research design.\n\nThis practice of running multiple analyses to test robustness, when done transparently and as part of a lab-wide methodological approach, represents responsible research rather than misconduct. If anything, systematic exploration of how results hold up under different analytical choices represents a more thorough and rigorous approach to data analysis.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria in the lab's data management logs would still be quite likely, but for different reasons:\n\n1. Cover for p-hacking: A lab-wide initiative focusing on \"robustness\" creates a perfect legitimate context within which to explore numerous analytical variations while searching for significant results. This environment would provide cover for trying many analyses until finding the desired outcome.\n\n2. Plausible deniability: Having multiple analysis scripts similar to other students provides excellent plausible deniability. If questioned, Lena could point to the lab culture and her peers' similar practices as justification.\n\n3. Fishing expedition documentation: These scripts could represent the actual trail of Lena's \"fishing expedition\" - trying various exclusion criteria until finding the combination that produced significant results, while maintaining the appearance of legitimate robustness testing.\n\n4. Selective reporting: The concerning issue wouldn't be running multiple analyses but rather selectively reporting only those that worked while presenting them as the primary planned analysis - which aligns with the modified preregistration document.\n\n5. Normalization of questionable practices: If the lab culture encouraged extensive exploration of analytical alternatives without appropriate statistical corrections, this might represent a lab-wide normalization of questionable research practices rather than Lena's individual misconduct.\n\n6. Camouflage through transparency: Ironically, openly storing various analyses provides good camouflage - the misconduct wouldn't be in creating these scripts but in how the final analysis was selected and presented in the paper.\n\nThis scenario is particularly insidious because it shows how the line between legitimate robustness testing and p-hacking can blur. The scripts themselves would look identical whether created for legitimate robustness testing or for finding significant results through multiple comparisons. The misconduct would lie in the selection and presentation process rather than in the existence of the scripts.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "To assess whether Lena committed academic misconduct, I need to evaluate all the evidence systematically:\n\nStrong evidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. Preregistration document was modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - this directly undermines the purpose of preregistration and suggests post-hoc adjustments.\n\n2. Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above - this distribution is a statistical fingerprint of p-hacking that's extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. Earlier analysis script included more participants than the final dataset - suggesting potential selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. Emails expressing pressure about needing the study to \"work\" and concerns about null results hurting her career - establishing clear motivation.\n\nMitigating evidence:\n\n1. Previous work passed independent audits with \"well-documented and reproducible\" ratings - suggesting prior adherence to good practices.\n\n2. Properly documented contemporaneous exclusion of two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions - showing appropriate research practices.\n\n3. Software changes and verified hard drive failure - providing some explanation for documentation issues.\n\n4. Multiple analysis scripts with different criteria were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative - potentially normalizing the exploration of different analytical approaches.\n\nWeighing these factors, the most damaging evidence is the modified preregistration and the suspicious p-value distribution. These issues are very difficult to explain through innocent means. The selective participant exclusion and pressure-revealing emails further strengthen the case for misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena's previously clean record suggests she knew proper procedures, the specific evidence in this case points strongly toward deliberate manipulation of analyses to achieve desired results, particularly changing the preregistration after seeing the data and the telltale p-value distribution.\n\nProbability judgment: 85"
