    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern is often referred to as a \"p-curve\" or \"p-hacking\" signature.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, how might this pattern arise?\n\n1. **Multiple comparisons without correction**: If Lena ran many exploratory analyses without proper correction for multiple comparisons, she might naturally report only the significant findings. This could create a clustering just below .05, but would typically still show some values just above .05.\n\n2. **Selective reporting of analyses**: Even without malicious intent, researchers sometimes try different analysis approaches until finding one that works. This \"researcher degrees of freedom\" can create this pattern unintentionally.\n\n3. **Confirmation bias**: Lena might have unconsciously favored analyses that supported the theory, stopping when she found significant results.\n\n4. **Software issues**: The lab's switch in software could theoretically cause systematic calculation differences, but it's unlikely this would specifically cluster p-values just below .05.\n\nHowever, several factors make this pattern particularly suspicious:\n\n- The sharp discontinuity (many values just below .05, almost none just above) is statistically unlikely to occur naturally\n- This pattern specifically appears in exploratory analyses (where there's more flexibility)\n- The pattern matches a known signature of selective analysis or p-hacking\n- The main effect has p = .01, which doesn't follow this pattern, possibly suggesting different treatment of confirmatory vs. exploratory analyses\n\nWhile honest mistakes and unintentional biases can create some clustering of p-values, the specific pattern described (high concentration just below .05 with almost none just above) is statistically unlikely without some form of selection pressure, whether conscious or unconscious.\n\nGiven the information provided, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this specific p-value distribution pattern is quite low.\n\n20"

Here's why this pattern would be likely if misconduct occurred:\n\n1. **Threshold-driven behavior**: The p < .05 threshold is the standard significance level in many fields. If someone is manipulating data or analyses to achieve significance, they would specifically target getting values below this threshold.\n\n2. **Minimal effort principle**: When manipulating data or analyses, a researcher would typically stop once they've achieved the desired significance (just below .05), rather than pushing for even lower p-values which would require more extensive manipulation.\n\n3. **Selection mechanism**: If someone is selectively reporting only significant findings or manipulating analyses until significance is achieved, this creates a sharp discontinuity right at the .05 threshold.\n\n4. **Fingerprint of manipulation**: This specific pattern (clustering just below .05 with a drop-off above .05) is so statistically unlikely to occur naturally that it has become recognized as a warning sign in scientific integrity investigations.\n\n5. **Focus on exploratory analyses**: The fact that this pattern appears in exploratory analyses rather than the main analyses suggests selective flexibility in analytical approaches where there's more room for manipulation.\n\nThis pattern has become such a recognized indicator of potential misconduct that some journals now specifically examine p-value distributions in submitted papers. Statistical tools have even been developed to detect this type of anomaly in research.\n\nIf Lena were deliberately manipulating analyses or selectively reporting results to achieve statistical significance, this is precisely the pattern we would expect to see in her data.\n\n85"

Having an early version with more participants that were later legitimately excluded would be quite typical in this research area.\n\nGiven that participant exclusion is a normal part of the research process, especially in cognitive neuroscience, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it's quite likely that legitimate exclusions would occur between early and final analyses.\n\n75"

Here's why:\n\n1. **Result-driven exclusions**: The most direct form of misconduct would be selectively excluding participants whose data don't support the desired hypothesis. This practice, sometimes called \"cherry-picking,\" allows a researcher to strengthen the apparent effect by removing contradictory data points.\n\n2. **Post-hoc criteria creation**: A researcher engaging in misconduct might analyze the full dataset, identify which participants' data are weakening the desired effect, then retroactively create exclusion criteria that happen to remove these problematic participants.\n\n3. **Undisclosed optional stopping**: Lena might have analyzed data after collecting a certain number of participants, found insignificant results, continued data collection, and then selectively included participants until achieving significance.\n\n4. **Flexible outlier definitions**: Misconduct could involve adjusting outlier criteria specifically to exclude data points that weaken the effect while retaining those that strengthen it.\n\n5. **Hiding exploratory nature**: What appears as participant exclusion might represent trying multiple analysis approaches and only reporting the one that worked best.\n\n6. **Strategic application of legitimate criteria**: Even when using seemingly valid exclusion criteria, applying them inconsistently (strictly to data that hurts the hypothesis, leniently to supporting data) constitutes misconduct.\n\nThis type of misconduct is particularly likely in situations with:\n- Pressure to produce positive results (which exists in this case with the grant review)\n- High-profile experiments where stakes are elevated\n- Situations where the researcher has significant control over data processing\n\nThe presence of an earlier script with more participants that were later excluded in a way that improved results is a classic red flag in scientific misconduct investigations. If Lena were engaging in misconduct, this would be one of the most straightforward and common methods to manipulate the data toward the desired outcome.\n\n90"

A professor under pressure for a grant renewal might genuinely communicate to lab members that positive results from key studies are important for continued funding. This doesn't necessarily imply pressure to falsify results, but rather emphasizes the study's importance.\n\n2. **\"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\"**: This reveals awareness of publication bias in academia. Unfortunately, null results are genuinely harder to publish in many fields, and publications are critical for postdoc applications. Lena might simply be expressing legitimate career anxiety rather than intent to manipulate data.\n\n3. **\"I need this one to work\"**: This could express hope for a positive outcome rather than determination to create one. \"Work\" could mean various things to a researcher - running smoothly, yielding clear data (whether supporting the hypothesis or not), or being publishable.\n\nThese statements reflect:\n- Normal awareness of career incentives in academia\n- Typical graduate student anxiety about future prospects\n- Recognition of the \"publish or perish\" reality\n- Pressure that exists even for completely honest researchers\n\nPhD students often vent to friends about research pressures without crossing ethical lines in their actual work.

It indicates Lena feels responsible for delivering specific results (not just rigorous science) and that there are significant consequences tied to the outcome. This creates justification in her mind for potential misconduct.\n\n2. **\"A null result would basically kill my chances at a postdoc\"**: This reveals Lena perceives a direct personal career threat from negative results. This statement is particularly concerning as it explicitly links her career advancement to achieving specific results rather than conducting sound research. This creates a powerful self-interest motive for manipulation.\n\n3. **\"I need this one to work\"**: This suggests a results-oriented rather than process-oriented mindset. The focus on making the study \"work\" (likely meaning confirm the hypothesis) rather than discover the truth is particularly telling if misconduct occurred.\n\nThese statements together create a compelling narrative of someone who:\n- Feels trapped by professional and career pressures\n- Has identified specific negative consequences of null findings\n- Has psychologically framed the situation as requiring certain outcomes\n- Is prioritizing results over methodological integrity\n\nIndividuals who commit scientific misconduct often document their pressures and motivations in private communications, which later serve as evidence of their state of mind.

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the software switch and hard drive failure could still occur independently of her misconduct, but they might also serve as convenient covers or opportunities for data manipulation.\n\nThe software switch during the project:\n1. **Opportunity for manipulation**: Transitioning between statistical packages creates a natural break in analytical continuity that could be exploited to make changes without obvious traces.\n2. **Justification for discrepancies**: Software transitions provide a plausible explanation for why results or methods might differ between early and later analyses.\n3. **Technical complexity shield**: The technical challenges of software migration create complexity that can obscure deliberate manipulations.\n\nThe confirmed hard drive failure:\n1. **Selective data loss**: While the hardware failure was genuine (confirmed by IT), someone committing misconduct might selectively report which files were \"lost,\" strategically claiming that problematic raw data or original analyses were among the casualties.\n2. **Reduced accountability**: Missing files create gaps in the audit trail that limit others' ability to fully reconstruct the research process.\n3. **Plausible deniability**: A confirmed technical problem provides a non-fraudulent explanation for missing documentation.\n\nThe combination of these events if misconduct occurred:\n1. **Convenient timing**: These technical issues might have initially been genuine problems that Lena opportunistically exploited when facing pressure for results.\n2. **Multiple layers of explanation**: The software switch and data loss together create multiple overlapping explanations that make it difficult to untangle legitimate issues from potential manipulation.\n3. **Reduced reproducibility**: These circumstances make it harder for others to reproduce the full analytical pathway, potentially obscuring manipulation.\n\nIt's important to note that the IT confirmation of the hard drive failure only verifies that a hardware problem occurred, not which specific files were lost or whether backups existed. Someone committing misconduct might exaggerate the scope of data loss or selectively recover files.\n\nThese technical issues do occur naturally in research settings, so their presence doesn't prove misconduct. However, they create conditions that someone already inclined toward misconduct might exploit as cover for manipulations or as an explanation for inconsistencies that might otherwise raise suspicion.\n\n75"

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the existence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be highly consistent with modern open science practices and robust statistical methodology.\n\nThis pattern appears particularly legitimate for several reasons:\n\n1. **Lab-wide robustness initiative**: The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push\" indicates an institutional commitment to methodological rigor rather than an individual attempt to manipulate results. This suggests a culture of thoroughness rather than misconduct.\n\n2. **Similar patterns across students**: Other students showing similar script variations confirms this was a standard lab practice rather than unusual behavior by Lena. This consistency across researchers strongly supports legitimate methodological exploration.\n\n3. **Transparency in data logs**: The preservation of all these scripts in official data management logs demonstrates openness about the analytical approaches being tested, contrary to the secrecy typically associated with misconduct.\n\n4. **Methodological best practices**: Exploring the robustness of findings across different analytical decisions is increasingly recognized as a best practice in scientific research. This represents sensitivity analysis or multiverse analysis - recommended approaches for thorough research.\n\n5. **Range of strictness**: Testing both stricter and looser criteria suggests a comprehensive approach to understanding the data's sensitivity to analytical choices, rather than a directed search for significance.\n\n6. **Documentation in formal systems**: The fact that these variations were properly logged in the lab's official data management system indicates these were viewed as legitimate analytical explorations rather than hidden manipulations.\n\nThis pattern of multiple analyses aligns perfectly with evolving standards in scientific methodology that emphasize transparency about analytical choices and understanding how results might vary across different reasonable analytical approaches.\n\nIn a lab culture that explicitly encourages robustness testing, a researcher with integrity would be expected to generate precisely these kinds of script variations while maintaining proper documentation - exactly what we see in Lena's case.\n\n95"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria in the official data logs could still be quite likely, though serving a different purpose than legitimate robustness testing.\n\nHere's why this pattern remains plausible even with misconduct:\n\n1. **Exploration for significance**: While appearing to test robustness, Lena might have been systematically searching for analytical approaches that produced significant results. Multiple scripts with varying exclusion criteria are the technical manifestation of \"p-hacking\" - trying different analyses until finding one that yields desired outcomes.\n\n2. **Camouflage through lab practices**: The lab-wide push for robustness testing provides perfect cover for questionable research practices. By making her p-hacking look identical to legitimate sensitivity analyses conducted by other students, Lena could hide misconduct in plain sight.\n\n3. **Selection without disclosure**: The key misconduct might not be in creating these alternative analyses, but in selectively reporting only the favorable ones while presenting them as the primary planned analysis, particularly if modifying the preregistration to match.\n\n4. **Plausible deniability**: Storing all scripts in the official system actually creates stronger deniability if questioned later - \"I was just being thorough like everyone else in the lab.\"\n\n5. **Hiding in transparency**: Sophisticated misconduct often incorporates elements of transparency to deflect suspicion. Having multiple analyses documented makes each individual choice appear less suspicious.\n\n6. **Knowledge of detection methods**: As awareness of statistical forensics increases, researchers engaging in misconduct have become more sophisticated about avoiding obvious red flags. Documenting exploration can preemptively counter accusations.\n\nThe critical distinction between legitimate robustness testing and misconduct isn't in having multiple analyses, but in:\n- Whether the final analysis was selected based on results rather than methodological validity\n- Whether the exploration was disclosed in the final paper\n- Whether preregistered plans were retroactively changed to match the most favorable analysis\n\nThe pattern of multiple scripts, similar to other students, provides excellent camouflage for potential misconduct, making detection more difficult by blending questionable practices with legitimate lab protocols.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct, I'll analyze the key evidence both for and against misconduct.\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n\n1. The dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with very few just above .05 in exploratory analyses. This pattern is a classic signature of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2. Preregistration documents were modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes. This is a serious violation of research integrity that undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\n3. Lena expressed significant pressure in emails, noting her supervisor \"counting on this study to save the grant\" and that she \"needs this one to work,\" indicating motivation for manipulation.\n\n4. Some participants were excluded between earlier and final analyses, which could represent selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n\n1. Lena has a strong prior record with studies that passed independent data audits and were rated \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\n2. There are legitimate reasons for excluding two participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions, with notes predating submission.\n\n3. The lab switched statistical software mid-project and Lena experienced a confirmed hard drive failure, which could explain some inconsistencies.\n\n4. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria were part of a lab-wide robustness initiative, and other students showed similar patterns.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The modification of preregistration documents after data collection is particularly damning, as this directly contradicts research integrity principles.\n- The p-value distribution shows a statistically unlikely pattern that strongly suggests selective analysis or reporting.\n- While technical issues like software changes and hard drive failures are plausible, they also provide convenient cover for manipulations.\n- The documented pressure to produce positive results establishes clear motivation.\n\nThe combination of altered preregistration, suspicious p-value patterns, and documented pressure significantly outweighs the mitigating factors of prior good record and some legitimate exclusions.\n\n75"
