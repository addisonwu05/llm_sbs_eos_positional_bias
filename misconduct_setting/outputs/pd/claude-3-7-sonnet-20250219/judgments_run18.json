  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence presented, my assessment is:\n\nNo\n\nWhile there are concerning elements in the case, particularly the p-value distribution and preregistration modifications, there are also multiple mitigating factors including Lena's strong prior record, documented legitimate exclusions, lab-wide analytical practices, and verified technical issues. The evidence does not reach the threshold of certainty typically required for a finding of academic misconduct, which demands clear and convincing evidence of intentional deception rather than questionable research practices or errors."
