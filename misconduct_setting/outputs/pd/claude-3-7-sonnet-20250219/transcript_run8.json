The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Let me consider how likely this would be without intentional misconduct:\n\n1. Purpose of preregistration - The core function of preregistration is to document analysis plans before seeing data, precisely to prevent researchers from altering methods to fit results they've already seen. Changing these elements after data collection fundamentally undermines this purpose.\n\n2. Knowledge of proper procedures - As a third-year PhD student in neuroscience, Lena would almost certainly understand that modifying preregistration after data collection violates research norms. This isn't an obscure rule but a foundational principle of preregistration.\n\n3. Legitimate reasons for post-data modification:\n   - Genuine errors in the original document might need correction\n   - Technical issues might require adjustment of methods\n   - Reviewer feedback might suggest improvements\n\nHowever, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes specifically are particularly problematic modifications because they directly influence which results are reported and how. These aren't minor technical adjustments but changes that can substantially alter conclusions.\n\nFor this to occur without misconduct, Lena would need to:\n- Be genuinely unaware that modifying these elements violates preregistration principles\n- Have made these changes transparently while documenting the timing and rationale\n- Not have done this to achieve more favorable results\n\nWhile honest errors can occur, the specific nature of these changes (exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) after seeing data makes this particularly difficult to explain as unintentional. These are precisely the elements researchers might change to obtain desired results.\n\nA non-fraudulent explanation would need to involve extreme carelessness or fundamental misunderstanding of research methods that would be unusual in a third-year PhD student.\n\n15"

Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Strategic advantage - Changing exclusion criteria after seeing the data is a classic way to manipulate results. It allows a researcher to selectively remove participants or data points that don't support their hypothesis while appearing to follow objective criteria.\n\n2. Altering primary outcomes - This is perhaps even more problematic. Changing what counts as the main result after seeing the data allows a researcher to elevate findings that happened to be significant while downplaying null results that were originally central to the study.\n\n3. Typical pattern in fraud cases - In documented cases of research misconduct, this precise behavior—modifying preregistered plans after seeing data—is a common tactic. It allows researchers to present exploratory findings as if they were confirmatory.\n\n4. Deliberate nature - Unlike some questionable research practices that might occur through carelessness, modifying a preregistration document requires deliberate action. The researcher must consciously choose to edit the document and change its content.\n\n5. Concealment attempt - The fact that these changes were discovered through file timestamps rather than being transparently reported suggests an attempt to hide the modifications, consistent with knowing the changes were improper.\n\nFor a researcher engaged in misconduct, modifying preregistration is an efficient strategy to achieve desired results while maintaining the appearance of scientific rigor. It allows them to \"have their cake and eat it too\" - gain the credibility of preregistration while retaining the flexibility to adjust analyses to find significant results.\n\nIf Lena were deliberately manipulating data or analyses to achieve publishable results, altering the preregistration document would be a logical and likely step in that process, particularly given the pressure she was under and her expressed need for the study to \"work.\"\n\n95"

Refinement of exclusion criteria: As analyses progress, researchers sometimes realize their initial criteria need adjustment for legitimate methodological reasons:\n   - Compliance thresholds may be adjusted based on the distribution of the data\n   - Attention check failures might be implemented more strictly\n   - Demographics criteria might be applied more consistently\n\n3. Honest correction: If participants were initially included who didn't meet the preregistered exclusion criteria, removing them would be appropriate correction.\n\nHowever, this finding must be viewed alongside other concerning elements:\n- The preregistration was modified after data collection\n- The exclusion of these particular participants led to more favorable results\n- The changes weren't transparently documented\n\nWithout misconduct, we would expect:\n- Clear documentation of why participants were excluded\n- Exclusions following preregistered criteria\n- Transparency about changes to analysis plans\n- Robustness checks showing results with and without exclusions\n\nWhile participant exclusions can absolutely happen for legitimate reasons in the normal research process, the combination with modified preregistration is concerning.

Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Result-driven participant selection is a common form of misconduct. If initial analyses with all participants didn't yield the desired significant effects, selectively removing participants whose data weakened the effect is an effective way to manufacture significance. This practice of \"cherry-picking\" participants can dramatically change outcomes.\n\n2. The pattern creates a clear mechanism for fraud. The progression from an earlier script with more participants to a final dataset with fewer participants provides the exact opportunity needed to selectively retain data points that support the hypothesis while eliminating those that don't.\n\n3. This aligns with the modification of the preregistration document. If Lena changed exclusion criteria after seeing the data, she could then apply these new criteria to justify removing specifically those participants whose data didn't support her hypothesis.\n\n4. The automatic backup revealing this change suggests she didn't intend for others to discover this evolution of the dataset, which indicates potential concealment.\n\n5. The high-stakes context matters significantly. Given her expressed need for the study to \"work,\" her supervisor's grant pressure, and her concern about postdoc prospects, she had strong motivation to ensure significant results.\n\nIn cases of confirmed data fraud, this exact pattern—analysis scripts showing progressive exclusion of participants until desired results emerge—is frequently observed. It's particularly telling because it allows researchers to maintain a facade of following methodological procedures while actually manipulating which data points are included in the final analysis.\n\nIf Lena was committing misconduct, selectively excluding participants would be one of the most straightforward, effective, and difficult-to-detect methods to ensure her results appeared significant.\n\n95"

Statistical distribution principles: Under normal circumstances, p-values should follow a uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true, or a right-skewed distribution when there are true effects. Neither distribution would naturally create a clustering just below .05 with a gap just above it.\n\n2. Publication bias without individual misconduct: The scientific literature as a whole shows this pattern due to publication bias, but an individual dataset shouldn't exhibit this pattern unless:\n   - Only reporting analyses that reached significance\n   - Running multiple analyses until finding significant results\n   - Adjusting analysis parameters until reaching significance\n\n3. Potential legitimate explanations:\n   - Extreme statistical coincidence (extremely unlikely)\n   - Pre-planned analyses with strong theoretical predictions (but this wouldn't explain the absence of p-values above .05)\n   - A series of underpowered studies with marginal effects (would produce some p-values above .05)\n\n4. Field-specific context: Cognitive neuroscience studies typically have modest sample sizes and complex analyses with researcher degrees of freedom, making this field particularly susceptible to p-hacking. However, this explains the temptation, not innocent occurrence.\n\nThis pattern, known as a \"p-curve discontinuity,\" is widely recognized as a statistical red flag in research integrity. While not impossible to occur naturally, it is extraordinarily unlikely without some form of selective analysis, reporting, or data manipulation.\n\nThe specific clustering of values (.047, .049, .041) so consistently close to but below .05 compounds the statistical improbability of this occurring without some form of manipulation.\n\n10"

This pattern is one of the strongest statistical fingerprints of data manipulation:\n\n1. This distribution represents the telltale sign of \"p-hacking\" – the practice of manipulating analyses until results cross the significance threshold. When researchers engage in p-hacking, they typically stop adjusting their analyses once they achieve p < .05, creating exactly this clustering pattern.\n\n2. Multiple methods of misconduct produce this pattern:\n   - Selectively excluding \"problematic\" participants until p < .05\n   - Trying multiple statistical tests and only reporting those with p < .05\n   - Adding covariates or interaction terms until significance is achieved\n   - Transforming variables in various ways until desired results emerge\n   - Stopping data collection once significance is reached\n\n3. The specific values mentioned (.047, .049, .041) are particularly telling. These aren't just below .05 – they're suspiciously clustered right at the threshold, suggesting someone may have manipulated analyses until just crossing the significance boundary.\n\n4. The absence of p-values just above .05 is especially revealing. In genuine research, we would expect to see values distributed across the range, including some just missing significance. The \"missing\" p-values between .05 and .10 create what statisticians call the \"p-curve discontinuity,\" a recognized indicator of potential manipulation.\n\n5. Combined with other evidence (modified preregistration, excluded participants), this pattern fits perfectly into a coherent picture of systematic data manipulation to achieve publishable results.\n\nStatistical analyses of published literature show this exact pattern is a reliable indicator of questionable research practices or outright fraud.

Properly excluding obviously problematic participants (like those who fell asleep) would be standard practice regardless of other manipulations.\n\n2. Strategic camouflage: A researcher committing fraud might be especially careful to document legitimate exclusions properly to establish credibility and divert attention from other questionable practices. Proper documentation of some exclusions can serve as cover for improper manipulations elsewhere.\n\n3. Mixed methods: Research misconduct rarely involves fabricating every aspect of a study. More commonly, researchers collect real data but then selectively analyze or report it. The legitimate exclusions could exist within a broader pattern of selective reporting or p-hacking.\n\n4. Limited scope: Two participants from a sample of 80 is a small percentage. If Lena was manipulating data, she could have properly excluded these obvious cases while still having plenty of room to selectively include/exclude other participants based on how their data affected results.\n\n5. Baseline competence: The contemporaneous notes demonstrate basic research competence and awareness of proper procedures, which doesn't preclude misconduct in other areas of the same study.\n\nThe presence of some properly documented legitimate exclusions provides very little evidence either for or against misconduct.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the existence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria would be highly consistent with legitimate research practices, especially in the context described. Let me analyze why:\n\n1. Robustness testing is a methodological strength: \n   - Running analyses with different exclusion criteria is a recommended practice to test whether results depend on specific analytical choices\n   - This approach aligns with growing emphasis on sensitivity analyses in cognitive neuroscience\n   - Explicitly testing stricter and looser criteria demonstrates methodological thoroughness rather than p-hacking\n\n2. Lab-wide practice provides important context:\n   - The fact that this was a \"lab-wide push\" indicates an institutional emphasis on robust methods\n   - Other students showing similar patterns suggests this was standard procedure rather than unusual behavior\n   - This represents structured exploration rather than selective searching for significance\n\n3. Documentation in official logs indicates transparency:\n   - The analyses were properly recorded in lab management systems\n   - This open documentation contrasts with hidden p-hacking, which would typically avoid creating traceable records\n   - Proper logging suggests these were planned, systematic analyses rather than undocumented explorations\n\n4. Methodological evolution in the field:\n   - The cognitive neuroscience field has increasingly emphasized robustness checks and multiverse analyses\n   - This pattern represents alignment with emerging best practices in the field\n   - The structured approach to testing multiple criteria reflects methodological sophistication\n\nIf Lena maintained research integrity, having multiple documented analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness initiative would be entirely expected and actually represents commendable methodological practice.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, the presence of multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria in the lab's data management logs would actually be quite consistent with certain types of data manipulation. Here's why:\n\n1. Disguised p-hacking within acceptable practices:\n   - The lab-wide robustness initiative provides perfect cover for running multiple analyses to find significant results\n   - What appears as methodological thoroughness could serve as a systematic search for specifications that yield desired outcomes\n   - The existence of multiple versions allows for selectively reporting only the favorable results while justifying them as part of standard robustness checks\n\n2. Plausible deniability:\n   - Having multiple scripts similar to other students creates normalcy and camouflage for questionable practices\n   - If challenged, Lena could point to the lab culture as justification for any analytical flexibility\n   - This approach allows exploration of many analysis paths while maintaining an appearance of methodological rigor\n\n3. Strategic documentation:\n   - Someone committing misconduct might deliberately create documentation trails for some analyses to establish credibility\n   - The most problematic manipulations might occur in undocumented analyses, while the logged scripts serve as decoys\n   - The official logging system might not capture all relevant details about how final results were selected\n\n4. Selective reporting opportunity:\n   - With multiple legitimate-looking analysis versions, Lena could cherry-pick which results to emphasize in the paper\n   - The final manuscript might only report results from the specific exclusion criteria that yielded significant findings\n   - This approach allows exploration of the \"garden of forking paths\" while presenting results as confirmatory\n\nThe lab-wide emphasis on robustness testing creates an environment where running multiple analyses is normalized, making it harder to distinguish between legitimate sensitivity analyses and selective reporting or p-hacking. This context would make misconduct both easier to execute and harder to detect.\n\n85"

    "content": "I'll systematically evaluate the evidence both for and against academic misconduct by Lena:\n\nEvidence suggesting misconduct:\n1. Modified preregistration after data collection (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) - This is a serious violation of research integrity principles and highly suspicious.\n2. Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above - This statistical anomaly is a strong indicator of p-hacking and extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n3. Excluded participants between earlier and final analysis - While exclusions can be legitimate, this pattern raises concerns about selective data use.\n4. Emails expressing pressure and need for the study to \"work\" - These establish motive, though don't directly prove misconduct.\n\nEvidence against misconduct:\n1. Clean prior record with well-documented, reproducible previous studies - Suggests general competence and integrity in previous work.\n2. Legitimate exclusion of two participants with contemporaneous documentation - Shows proper research practice in at least some exclusions.\n3. Confirmed technical issues (software switch and hard drive failure) - Provides plausible explanation for some irregularities.\n4. Multiple analysis scripts as part of lab-wide robustness testing - Consistent with legitimate methodological thoroughness, though could also enable p-hacking.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The modified preregistration after data collection is particularly damning, as this directly contradicts research integrity principles.\n- The p-value distribution just below .05 is statistically highly improbable without manipulation.\n- While some exclusions were legitimate, the pattern of changes and selective reporting is concerning.\n- Technical issues and multiple analyses provide some alternative explanations but don't fully account for the statistical anomalies.\n\nThe most suspicious elements (modified preregistration and p-value clustering) are difficult to explain through innocent means, while the mitigating factors (clean prior record, legitimate exclusions) don't directly counter the specific problematic patterns identified.\n\n75"
