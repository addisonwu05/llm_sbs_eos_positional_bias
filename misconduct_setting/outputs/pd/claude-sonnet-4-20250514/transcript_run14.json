The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern represents legitimate research practices:\n\n**Standard robustness testing:**\n- Running analyses with different exclusion criteria is a recognized method for assessing result robustness\n- Good research practice involves testing whether findings hold under various analytical assumptions\n- Sensitivity analyses with stricter and looser criteria help establish the reliability of results\n\n**Lab-wide initiative legitimacy:**\n- A coordinated lab effort to explore robustness suggests this was supervisory guidance, not individual manipulation\n- Having other students show similar patterns provides strong evidence this was standard lab practice\n- Institutional initiatives for improving research rigor are increasingly common in academic settings\n\n**Proper analytical workflow:**\n- Exploring multiple analytical approaches before finalizing methods is methodologically sound\n- Documenting various approaches in version-controlled scripts demonstrates transparency\n- This represents the type of thorough analytical exploration encouraged in modern research\n\n**Contemporary research standards:**\n- The replication crisis has led to increased emphasis on robustness checks and sensitivity analyses\n- Many labs now routinely require students to test multiple analytical specifications\n- Journals increasingly expect or encourage such robustness demonstrations\n\n**Data management best practices:**\n- Storing multiple analysis scripts shows good record-keeping rather than suspicious behavior\n- Version control and systematic documentation are hallmarks of rigorous research\n- The fact that this was logged and traceable suggests transparency rather than concealment\n\n**Comparative evidence:**\n- Other students showing identical patterns provides strong contextual evidence of legitimate practice\n- This suggests lab culture and training rather than individual misconduct\n- Independent verification from multiple researchers supports the legitimacy of this approach\n\n93"

The p-value pattern (clustering just below .05 with none just above) is so statistically improbable in legitimate research that it strongly suggests systematic manipulation.\n\nWhile Lena's clean track record and some legitimate explanations for irregularities provide some doubt, they don't adequately explain the most serious red flags. The pressure emails establish clear motive, and sophisticated researchers can maintain good practices on routine work while engaging in misconduct under extreme pressure.\n\nThe combination of modified preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution, established motive, and participant exclusions creates a coherent pattern pointing toward systematic data manipulation, despite some mitigating factors.\n\n78"
