  "Yes.\n\nThe p-value clustering pattern just below .05 with almost no values above .05 across multiple analyses is extremely strong statistical evidence of data manipulation. This pattern is well-documented in research integrity literature as a reliable indicator of misconduct and is highly improbable to occur naturally.\n\nCombined with the post-data collection modification of preregistration documents (changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes) and the clear motivational pressures documented in emails, the evidence points toward intentional manipulation despite some mitigating factors.\n\nWhile Lena's previous clean record and some legitimate research practices provide reasonable doubt, the statistical fingerprint of the p-value distribution is particularly damning evidence that is very difficult to explain through innocent means."
