The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When there are true effects, we'd expect to see some significant results, but the distribution around the .05 threshold should still be relatively balanced. Finding \"several exploratory analyses\" with p-values clustered just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) while having \"almost no p-values just above .05\" is statistically very unusual for honest research.\n\nThis pattern is particularly suspicious because:\n\n1. **Statistical improbability**: The asymmetric distribution around .05 defies what we'd expect from legitimate data analysis, even with some true effects present.\n\n2. **Exploratory analyses context**: These aren't the main pre-registered hypotheses but exploratory analyses, where researchers have more flexibility in analysis choices.\n\n3. **The \"cliff effect\"**: The sharp drop-off right at .05 suggests potential p-hacking or selective reporting rather than natural variation.\n\n4. **Multiple instances**: This isn't just one suspicious p-value but a pattern across several analyses.\n\nHowever, I must consider some mitigating factors:\n- File corruption and software changes could potentially affect some analyses\n- Researchers might legitimately re-run analyses with slightly different parameters\n- Some degree of analytical flexibility in exploratory work is normal\n\nBut even accounting for these factors, the specific pattern described - high concentration just below .05 with almost none just above - is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices alone. This type of distribution is a classic red flag in research integrity investigations and has been documented in studies of questionable research practices.\n\nThe probability that this exact pattern would emerge from completely honest research practices is very low.\n\n15"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, this p-value pattern would be highly expected and characteristic of common forms of data manipulation.\n\nThis distribution pattern is a classic signature of several types of research misconduct:\n\n1. **P-hacking/selective analysis**: Trying multiple analytical approaches until finding ones that yield p < .05, then only reporting those. This naturally creates clustering just below the significance threshold.\n\n2. **Data fabrication**: When fabricating data points to achieve significance, researchers typically aim for \"convincingly significant\" results - not too obvious (like p = .001) but clearly below .05. Values like .047, .049, .041 appear statistically significant while seeming \"realistic.\"\n\n3. **Selective deletion**: Removing inconvenient data points or participants that push results above .05, which would create the observed asymmetric distribution.\n\n4. **Outcome switching**: Changing which analyses are reported based on which ones achieve significance, leading to the absence of p-values just above .05.\n\nThe pattern described - high concentration just below .05 with almost no values just above .05 across multiple exploratory analyses - is essentially a textbook example of what statisticians and research integrity experts look for when investigating misconduct. This type of distribution has been documented extensively in studies examining questionable research practices and is considered strong evidence of manipulation.\n\nThe context makes this even more likely: exploratory analyses give researchers maximum flexibility for manipulation, and the pressure from Professor Mills for publishable results provides clear motive. Someone engaging in misconduct would be specifically targeting the .05 threshold, making this exact pattern almost inevitable.\n\nThe only reason this isn't certainty is that some forms of misconduct might produce different patterns (like obviously fabricated effect sizes), but for the types of manipulation most commonly seen in real cases, this p-value distribution would be the expected result.\n\n92"

Multi-year PhD projects often span multiple software versions or platforms.\n\n2. **Hardware failures are common**: Laptop hard drive failures are unfortunately routine, especially with the intensive computational demands of research work. Graduate students often use older equipment that's more prone to failure.\n\n3. **Independent verification**: The IT department confirmation of a hardware failure provides objective, third-party documentation that this actually occurred. This isn't something that could be fabricated after the fact.\n\n4. **Timing is realistic**: Hardware failures don't occur on convenient schedules - they happen when they happen, often at inconvenient times during ongoing projects.\n\n5. **Normal research disruptions**: Any graduate student who has completed a PhD can likely recount similar technical setbacks - software compatibility issues, hardware failures, lost files, etc.\n\n6. **Plausible explanation for gaps**: These technical issues provide straightforward explanations for some of the missing documentation or file irregularities without invoking misconduct.\n\nThe combination of confirmed hardware failure and documented software transition represents the kind of mundane technical challenges that regularly disrupt research workflows. These are exactly the types of legitimate complications that create gaps in documentation and analysis trails.\n\n78"

Someone engaging in data manipulation might feel particularly emboldened knowing they have legitimate explanations for any missing evidence or analytical irregularities.\n\nThe technical issues are independently verified and real, but this makes them even more valuable as cover for misconduct.\n\n73"

The combination creates a coherent pattern of systematic manipulation. While the mitigating factors show Lena wasn't categorically unethical, they don't adequately explain the most suspicious statistical patterns.\n\nThe pressure documented in emails, combined with the opportunity created by technical disruptions and lab practices, establishes both motive and means for misconduct.\n\n72"
