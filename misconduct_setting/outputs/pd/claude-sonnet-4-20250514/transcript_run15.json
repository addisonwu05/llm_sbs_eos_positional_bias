The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When there are true effects, we'd expect more small p-values, but the distribution around the .05 threshold should still be relatively smooth. Finding an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (like .047, .049, .041) with very few just above .05 is a classic red flag in research integrity investigations.\n\nThis pattern is particularly suspicious because:\n\n1. **Statistical improbability**: If analyses were conducted honestly, p-values should be distributed more evenly around .05. The sharp cutoff right at the significance threshold is highly unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. **Behavioral explanation**: This pattern is exactly what we'd expect if someone were selectively reporting, modifying, or fabricating results to achieve statistical significance - a practice known as \"p-hacking\" in its milder forms or outright falsification in more severe cases.\n\n3. **Multiple instances**: The fact that this pattern appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" makes it exponentially less likely to be coincidental.\n\n4. **Publication pressure context**: Given the high-stakes situation (major grant review, top journal submission), there was clear motive for producing significant results.\n\nWhile there are some innocent explanations mentioned (software changes, missing files), these don't adequately explain the specific statistical pattern observed. Software changes might affect data processing, but wouldn't systematically push p-values to just below .05. Missing files might explain gaps in documentation, but not this particular distribution of results.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above represents one of the strongest statistical signatures of research misconduct recognized in the literature on research integrity.\n\n15"

The whole point is to create a timestamped, unalterable record of research intentions.\n\n**Reasons this would be extremely unlikely if no misconduct occurred:**\n\n1. **Fundamental violation of preregistration principles**: Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection defeats the entire purpose of preregistration and represents a serious breach of research integrity protocols.\n\n2. **Training and awareness**: A third-year PhD student in cognitive neuroscience would be well-trained on preregistration procedures and would understand that post-hoc modifications are inappropriate.\n\n3. **Technical barriers**: Most preregistration platforms (OSF, AsPredicted, etc.) are designed to prevent post-hoc modifications, requiring deliberate effort to circumvent.\n\n4. **Professional standards**: This practice is explicitly prohibited in research integrity guidelines and would be recognized as misconduct by professional standards.\n\n**Potential innocent explanations are very weak:**\n\n- **Administrative error**: Highly unlikely that someone would accidentally modify substantive elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n- **Software issues**: Wouldn't explain changing specific methodological content\n- **Miscommunication**: A PhD student would know not to alter preregistration regardless of supervisor instructions\n\nThe modification of exclusion criteria is particularly damning because this directly affects which data points are included/excluded - a classic form of data manipulation. Similarly, changing primary outcomes after seeing results is textbook HARKing.\n\nThe combination of these modifications being made specifically after data collection, rather than before or during, strongly suggests they were made in response to the actual results obtained.\n\n5"

She could point to verified IT records and lab-wide software changes.\n\n5. **Lucky coincidence for misconduct**: The combination of legitimate technical chaos could have made this seem like the perfect time to engage in data manipulation with reduced risk of detection.\n\n**Strategic value if misconduct occurred:**\n- **Explains inconsistencies**: Technical problems provide ready-made explanations for suspicious patterns\n- **Reduces scrutiny**: Real technical issues deflect attention from intentional manipulation\n- **Creates confusion**: Makes it harder to distinguish between innocent technical problems and deliberate misconduct\n\nThe key insight is that these technical events are genuine and independent - they would occur regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct, but they would be extremely convenient if she did.\n\n75"

These are fundamental threats to data validity.\n\n2. **Proper documentation timing**: The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission is crucial evidence of legitimate practice. This shows decisions were made based on data quality concerns during collection, not post-hoc manipulation for publication.\n\n3. **Methodological necessity**: Including data from sleeping participants or those who didn't understand the task would actually be methodologically inappropriate and could constitute poor research practice.\n\n4. **Contemporary documentation**: Having notes in raw data files that predate submission demonstrates real-time decision making based on observed participant behavior, not retrospective justification.\n\n5. **Transparent record-keeping**: Documenting these issues in raw data files shows proper research practices and attention to data quality.\n\n**Why this strongly supports innocence:**\n- **Proactive quality control**: Shows Lena was monitoring data quality during collection\n- **Appropriate exclusions**: These are exactly the types of participants that should be excluded\n- **Temporal evidence**: Predating submission proves decisions weren't results-driven\n- **Standard practice**: Any competent researcher would exclude these participants\n\n**Reframes earlier concerns**: This evidence suggests that at least some participant exclusions were clearly legitimate and properly documented, supporting the interpretation that Lena follows appropriate research practices.\n\nThis represents exactly the kind of careful, documented decision-making expected in rigorous research.\n\n95"

This creates a pattern where some exclusions are obviously legitimate, providing cover for more suspicious ones.\n\n2. **Establishing credibility**: By properly documenting and excluding clear-cut cases (sleeping, not understanding), Lena would demonstrate that she follows proper procedures, making other exclusions seem more legitimate by association.\n\n3. **Strategic misdirection**: Having some obviously appropriate exclusions with proper timestamps provides evidence she can point to when defending her practices: \"See, I properly excluded problematic participants with contemporaneous documentation.\"\n\n4. **Methodological competence**: This shows she understands proper research practices, which actually makes sophisticated misconduct more feasible. She knows what legitimate exclusions look like and can mimic proper procedures.\n\n5. **Partial honesty pattern**: Many misconduct cases involve researchers who follow proper procedures in some areas while manipulating others. Complete fabrication is rarer than selective manipulation.\n\n**Strategic advantages:**\n- **Provides defense evidence**: \"I excluded participants properly based on documented criteria\"\n- **Demonstrates competence**: Shows she knows proper procedures, making \"mistakes\" seem less likely\n- **Creates confusion**: Makes it harder to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate exclusions\n- **Establishes pattern**: Suggests all exclusions followed similar rigorous standards\n\n**Historical precedent**: Sophisticated misconduct often involves mixing legitimate practices with manipulation to maintain plausibility and avoid detection.\n\n78"

These are classic statistical and procedural signatures of research misconduct that are extremely difficult to explain through innocent means.\n\nWhile there are several mitigating factors - the lab-wide robustness testing, verified technical problems, clean prior record, and proper documentation of some exclusions - these don't adequately explain the core statistical anomalies. The p-value distribution in particular represents one of the strongest indicators of data manipulation recognized in research integrity investigations.\n\nThe technical problems and lab practices provide plausible explanations for some irregularities, but they don't explain why the final results show such a suspicious statistical pattern. Someone conducting legitimate robustness testing would be expected to report the full range of results, not selectively present only those just below the significance threshold.\n\nThe modification of preregistration documents after data collection, combined with the statistical anomalies, suggests a systematic effort to make manipulated results appear methodologically sound and pre-planned.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the uncertainty and the presence of mitigating evidence, the combination of statistical red flags and procedural violations points more strongly toward misconduct than toward an unfortunate confluence of legitimate research practices and technical problems.\n\n**Yes**"
