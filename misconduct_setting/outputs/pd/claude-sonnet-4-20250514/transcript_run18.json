The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Based on the totality of evidence, I need to weigh several competing factors:\n\n**Strong evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n- The suspicious p-value clustering just below .05 with almost no values above .05 is a classic statistical red flag that's highly unlikely to occur naturally\n- Post-hoc modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes represents a serious violation of research integrity\n- These two pieces of evidence are particularly damning as they indicate systematic manipulation\n\n**Moderate evidence suggesting misconduct:**\n- The emails expressing desperate pressure and need for the study to \"work\" establish clear motive\n- The pattern fits classic situational misconduct under career pressure\n\n**Evidence that could support either scenario:**\n- Multiple analysis scripts and participant exclusions are consistent with both legitimate robustness testing and sophisticated p-hacking\n- The technical issues (software switch, hard drive failure) are genuine but could provide convenient cover\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n- Strong prior track record with independent audit validation\n- Legitimate exclusions of participants who fell asleep/didn't understand instructions, properly documented\n- Lab-wide practices that normalize multiple analytical approaches\n\n**Key consideration:**\nThe combination of the p-value clustering pattern AND the post-hoc preregistration modifications creates a very concerning picture. These are both sophisticated forms of misconduct that together suggest systematic manipulation rather than innocent mistakes. While Lena's prior good record and some legitimate practices provide some counterweight, the statistical and procedural irregularities are difficult to explain through honest research practices.\n\nThe technical issues and pressure, while real, appear to have provided both opportunity and motivation for misconduct.\n\n78"
