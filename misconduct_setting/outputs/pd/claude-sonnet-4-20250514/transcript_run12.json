The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When researchers conduct many exploratory tests, we'd expect to see p-values scattered throughout the range - some well below 0.05, some well above, and a relatively even distribution around the 0.05 threshold.\n\nThe pattern described - many p-values clustered just below 0.05 (0.041, 0.047, 0.049) with almost none just above 0.05 - is highly suspicious for several reasons:\n\n1. **Statistical improbability**: If analyses were legitimate, having multiple p-values cluster in the narrow band just below 0.05 while avoiding the band just above 0.05 would be quite unlikely by chance alone.\n\n2. **\"P-hacking\" signature**: This pattern is a classic indicator of selective reporting, data manipulation, or repeated analysis until significance is achieved. Researchers engaging in questionable practices often stop when they reach significance, creating this artificial clustering.\n\n3. **Missing expected distribution**: In honest exploratory research, we'd expect some p-values in the 0.051-0.070 range. The absence of values just above the significance threshold suggests potential manipulation.\n\n4. **Multiple occurrences**: That this pattern appears across \"several\" exploratory analyses makes it even more statistically unlikely to occur naturally.\n\nWhile there could be some innocent explanations (perhaps Lena only reported the analyses that worked), the specific pattern described - the tight clustering just below 0.05 combined with the conspicuous absence of values just above 0.05 across multiple analyses - is very difficult to explain through legitimate research practices alone.\n\nThis type of p-value distribution is considered a red flag in research integrity investigations and meta-scientific studies of publication bias.\n\n15"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, this p-value pattern would be quite likely to emerge, but the exact probability depends on the specific type of misconduct and her approach.\n\n**Factors making this pattern likely under misconduct:**\n\n1. **P-hacking behavior**: If Lena engaged in questionable research practices like selective analysis, optional stopping, or tweaking variables until reaching significance, she would naturally stop analyzing once p-values dropped below 0.05. This creates exactly the clustering pattern described.\n\n2. **Data fabrication targeting significance**: If fabricating data points, a researcher would likely aim for \"convincing\" significance - not too obvious (like p = 0.001) but clearly below the threshold. Values like 0.041, 0.047, 0.049 appear statistically significant yet realistic.\n\n3. **Selective reporting**: Even with legitimate mixed results, misconduct could involve only reporting analyses that achieved significance while suppressing those with p > 0.05.\n\n4. **Response to review pressure**: Given the grant pressure mentioned, Lena might have specifically manipulated borderline results to ensure they appeared significant.\n\n**Factors that might reduce this likelihood:**\n\n1. **Different manipulation strategies**: Some forms of misconduct might produce different patterns (very low p-values, or broader manipulation not focused on the 0.05 threshold).\n\n2. **Sophistication level**: A more sophisticated approach might deliberately include some non-significant results to avoid suspicion.\n\nHowever, the described pattern - multiple p-values clustered just below 0.05 with conspicuous absence of values just above - is exactly what we'd expect from common forms of research misconduct, especially p-hacking and selective analysis. This pattern is so characteristic of questionable research practices that it's used as a diagnostic tool in meta-research.\n\n85"

The postdoc market pressure she mentioned in emails represents a new level of professional desperation.\n\n3. **Sophisticated misconduct**: Someone capable of the complex manipulation alleged (modified preregistration, selective analysis, strategic exclusions) would likely be skilled enough to maintain good documentation and reproducible practices when not under extreme pressure.\n\n4. **Opportunistic misconduct**: The combination of extreme pressure + technical disruptions (software switch, hard drive failure) + lab practices (multiple analysis scripts) created a unique \"perfect storm\" that didn't exist during her previous work.\n\n5. **Research on academic misconduct**: Studies show that misconduct often emerges situationally rather than reflecting consistent character flaws - many cases involve researchers with previously clean records who succumb to specific high-pressure situations.\n\n**Why this pattern fits:**\n\n- Explains how someone with good methodological skills could execute sophisticated misconduct\n- Accounts for the apparent premeditation and technical competence required\n- Shows that the capacity for good research practices exists, but was overridden by circumstances\n\nThe clean record actually makes Lena more capable of effective misconduct while also providing character evidence that could serve as cover.\n\n60"

These directly compromise data validity.\n\n2. **Contemporary documentation**: The fact that exclusion notes were made in real-time (predating submission) demonstrates proper research workflow rather than post-hoc rationalization. This is exactly how ethical data management should work.\n\n3. **Standard research practice**: These exclusions are so obviously justified that they would be expected in any well-conducted study. NOT excluding such participants would actually be questionable research practice.\n\n4. **Transparent record-keeping**: Having documented notes about participant behavior shows good research habits and transparency - the kind of detailed documentation that honest researchers maintain.\n\n5. **Self-reported issues**: The fact that participants themselves reported these problems (rather than Lena inferring them) adds credibility and removes any suggestion of subjective bias in exclusion decisions.\n\n**Why this evidence favors innocence:**\n\n- Shows systematic, contemporaneous documentation\n- Demonstrates adherence to basic research quality standards\n- Provides legitimate, unambiguous justification for exclusions\n- The timing (predating submission) rules out post-hoc manipulation\n- These are exactly the kinds of exclusions that reviewers and journals expect\n\n**Context of other evidence:**\n\nThis evidence helps distinguish between legitimate exclusions (like these) and potentially problematic ones, suggesting that Lena does understand and apply appropriate exclusion criteria when warranted.\n\nThis represents normal, expected research conduct that any ethical researcher would follow.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it would still be quite likely that participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions would be excluded based on contemporaneous notes predating journal submission.\n\n**Why this would still occur under misconduct:**\n\n1. **Mixed legitimate and illegitimate exclusions**: Researchers engaging in misconduct often combine obviously justified exclusions (like these) with more questionable ones. This creates a pattern where some exclusions are clearly legitimate while others serve to manipulate results.\n\n2. **Establishes credible baseline**: Having well-documented, obviously justified exclusions helps establish credibility for other, more questionable exclusions that might be made later. It shows \"See, I do exclude participants for legitimate reasons.\"\n\n3. **Standard research competence**: Someone sophisticated enough to engage in the complex misconduct alleged (modified preregistration, selective analysis) would certainly recognize and document obviously problematic participants.\n\n4. **Strategic documentation**: A researcher planning misconduct might be especially careful to document clearly legitimate exclusions while being more selective about other cases that better serve their statistical needs.\n\n5. **Partial ethical behavior**: Misconduct doesn't mean abandoning all research standards - even researchers engaging in questionable practices typically maintain some legitimate procedures alongside problematic ones.\n\n**How this fits the misconduct scenario:**\n\n- Demonstrates that Lena knows proper exclusion procedures, making selective application more concerning\n- Shows capability for good documentation when it doesn't conflict with desired outcomes\n- Provides cover for other exclusions by establishing a pattern of \"justified\" removals\n- The timing and documentation actually show sophistication that could facilitate more subtle forms of data manipulation\n\nThis evidence shows good research practices in obvious cases, but doesn't rule out selective application of different standards for borderline cases that might affect statistical significance.\n\n75"

Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes post-data collection fundamentally undermines research integrity and is difficult to explain innocently.\n\n2. **Suspicious p-value distribution** - The clustering of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above is a classic signature of p-hacking or selective analysis that's statistically very unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n3. **Clear motive and pressure** - Lena's emails document exactly the kind of high-stakes pressure (supervisor counting on results, career implications, \"need this to work\") that research shows drives misconduct.\n\n**Evidence supporting innocence:**\n\n1. **Clean prior record** - Her previous studies passed independent audit and were rated as well-documented and reproducible, suggesting established ethical practices.\n\n2. **Legitimate exclusions documented** - Participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions were properly excluded with contemporaneous documentation.\n\n3. **Technical explanations** - Software transitions, hardware failures, and lab-wide practices around multiple analysis scripts provide some innocent explanations for irregularities.\n\n**Critical analysis:**\n\nThe modified preregistration is extremely difficult to explain away innocently and directly enables the other suspicious patterns. Combined with the p-value clustering and clear motive, this suggests systematic rather than accidental misconduct. While the technical issues and prior good record provide some mitigation, they don't adequately explain the core problematic behaviors.\n\nThe sophistication required (modifying preregistration, selective analysis, maintaining some legitimate practices) actually fits with someone who has demonstrated research competence but succumbed to unprecedented pressure.\n\nThe evidence points more strongly toward misconduct than innocence, though some uncertainty remains.\n\n75"
