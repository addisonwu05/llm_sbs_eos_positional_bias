  "Yes.\n\nThe statistical evidence is particularly compelling - the pattern of p-values clustering just below 0.05 while avoiding values just above 0.05 is a classic signature of data manipulation that is extremely unlikely to occur naturally. Combined with the post-hoc modification of preregistration documents to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection, this creates a strong pattern consistent with systematic misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena has mitigating factors (strong prior record, some legitimate exclusions, verified technical issues), the core statistical and procedural evidence points to deliberate manipulation rather than honest research practices that happened to produce suspicious patterns by coincidence."
