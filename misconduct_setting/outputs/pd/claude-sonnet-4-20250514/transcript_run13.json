The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When there are true effects, we'd expect to see more very small p-values (strong evidence) rather than a concentration just below the significance threshold.\n\nThe pattern described - many p-values clustering just below 0.05 (like 0.047, 0.049, 0.041) with almost none just above 0.05 - is highly suspicious for several reasons:\n\n1. **Statistical improbability**: This creates a sharp discontinuity around 0.05 that's extremely unlikely to occur naturally. If effects were real, we'd expect a more gradual distribution.\n\n2. **Selective reporting bias**: Even with questionable research practices like selective analysis choices, researchers typically end up with some non-significant results they either report or exclude entirely - not this precise clustering pattern.\n\n3. **The \"exploratory analyses\" context**: The fact that this pattern appears in exploratory (rather than pre-planned) analyses makes it even more suspicious, as these are more susceptible to manipulation.\n\n4. **Human behavioral patterns**: This concentration just below 0.05 follows exactly what someone might do if they were manipulating data or analyses to achieve significance - stopping when they hit the \"magic number\" rather than continuing to optimize further.\n\nWhile there are some innocent explanations mentioned (software changes, missing files), these wouldn't specifically explain why p-values would cluster just below 0.05 rather than being more randomly distributed.\n\nThe probability of seeing this specific pattern through legitimate research processes is extremely low.\n\n5"

This is the key boundary between \"publishable\" and \"unpublishable\" results in many fields.\n\n2. **Stopping rule behavior**: A person fabricating or manipulating data would likely stop tweaking once they achieved significance, rather than continuing to optimize further. This creates the clustering just below 0.05 rather than pushing for even smaller p-values.\n\n3. **Avoiding suspicion of being \"too good\"**: Experienced researchers know that p-values of 0.001 or 0.0001 might look suspiciously strong for exploratory analyses. Values like 0.047 or 0.041 appear more \"realistic\" while still being significant.\n\n4. **Elimination of inconvenient results**: Someone manipulating data would systematically remove or alter analyses that produced p-values above 0.05, explaining why there are almost none just above the threshold.\n\n5. **Multiple exploratory analyses context**: The fact that this pattern appears across \"several exploratory analyses\" suggests systematic manipulation rather than one lucky result.\n\n6. **Psychological anchoring**: The 0.05 threshold acts as a strong psychological anchor for someone engaging in misconduct - they would naturally cluster their manipulated results around this critical value.\n\nThis pattern is essentially a \"smoking gun\" signature of p-hacking, data fabrication, or selective reporting taken to an extreme level.\n\n85"

Someone manipulating data would exclude participants who don't support the hypothesis while keeping those who do.\n\n2. **P-hacking through exclusions**: Given the suspicious p-value clustering just below 0.05, selective participant removal is a classic method to push borderline non-significant results into significance. This fits perfectly with the observed pattern.\n\n3. **Iterative manipulation process**: Research misconduct often involves trying different combinations of participants, analyses, and exclusions until achieving the desired results. Earlier scripts would naturally show more participants before this \"optimization\" process.\n\n4. **Post-hoc justification**: After identifying which participants to exclude for statistical benefit, someone engaging in misconduct would then create seemingly legitimate post-hoc reasons for the exclusions.\n\n5. **Pressure context**: Given Professor Mills' pressure for publishable results before the grant review, there would be strong motivation to manipulate the participant pool to ensure significant findings.\n\n6. **Covering tracks**: The \"missing files due to hard drive failure\" mentioned earlier could be an attempt to hide evidence of this selective exclusion process.\n\n7. **Multiple analysis rounds**: The fact that an automated backup captured an earlier version suggests multiple rounds of analysis - exactly what you'd expect if someone was systematically trying different participant combinations.\n\nSelective participant exclusion is one of the most common and effective forms of data manipulation in research misconduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, having these legitimate participant exclusions with pre-dating documentation would still be quite likely for several reasons:\n\n1. **Mixed legitimate and illegitimate practices**: Research misconduct rarely involves fabricating every aspect of a study. Someone committing fraud would likely combine some legitimate exclusions (like these clear-cut cases) with illegitimate ones to create a more credible overall picture.\n\n2. **Establishing credible baseline**: Having some obviously legitimate, well-documented exclusions helps establish credibility for other more questionable exclusions that might actually be fraudulent.\n\n3. **Standard operating procedures**: Even someone planning misconduct would follow normal protocols for clear-cut cases like sleeping or confused participants, as excluding them is universally accepted and expected.\n\n4. **Partial fraud strategy**: Sophisticated misconduct often involves selectively manipulating only the data needed to achieve significance while leaving other aspects of the study legitimate to avoid detection.\n\n5. **Cover for other exclusions**: These legitimate exclusions provide documentation patterns that could help justify other, more suspicious participant removals by making the overall exclusion process appear systematic and principled.\n\n6. **Natural occurrence**: Sleep and comprehension issues occur in most studies regardless of any misconduct, so these would likely happen organically even in a fraudulent study.\n\n7. **Risk management**: Someone committing fraud would want to handle obvious, defensible exclusions properly to avoid unnecessary scrutiny on any aspect of their data management.\n\nThe presence of some legitimate exclusions doesn't preclude misconduct in other areas of the analysis.\n\n75"

While the mitigating factors show Lena wasn't categorically unethical, they don't adequately explain away the most suspicious evidence.\n\nThe combination of clear motive (career pressure), opportunity (sole data handler), and highly suspicious statistical/documentary patterns creates a compelling case for misconduct, despite some legitimate aspects of her work.\n\n78"

The combination of:\n\n1. **Statistically implausible p-value clustering** just below 0.05 with virtually none above it\n2. **Post-data collection modification of preregistration documents** changing both exclusion criteria and primary outcomes\n3. **Clear documented motive** from her emails about career pressure and needing results\n4. **Suspicious participant exclusions** between earlier and final datasets\n\nThese factors, particularly the first two, represent patterns that are extremely difficult to explain through legitimate research practices or innocent mistakes. While some aspects of her work appear legitimate (proper exclusion of sleeping participants, verified technical issues), the core statistical and documentary evidence points strongly toward deliberate data manipulation and falsification of research records.\n\nThe technical issues and previous good record suggest this may have been situational misconduct driven by extraordinary pressure rather than a pattern of fraud, but the evidence indicates misconduct nonetheless occurred in this specific study."
