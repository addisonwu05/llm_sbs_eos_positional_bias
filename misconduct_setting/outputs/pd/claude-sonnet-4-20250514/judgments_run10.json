  "Based on my analysis of all the evidence, I believe the probability of misconduct is high enough that it crosses the threshold of reasonable certainty for an academic misconduct finding.\n\nThe combination of two critical pieces of evidence - the post-data collection modification of preregistration documents and the highly suspicious p-value distribution - creates a compelling case that goes beyond coincidence. These are both well-established statistical signatures of research fraud that are extremely unlikely to occur innocently, especially together.\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors (clean track record, verified technical issues, institutional practices), they don't adequately explain away the core evidence of results manipulation. The technical disruptions and robustness testing may have provided opportunity and cover, but don't account for the specific patterns observed.\n\n**Yes**"
