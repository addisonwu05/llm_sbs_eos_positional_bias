The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

When there are some true effects, we'd expect to see more p-values clustered at very low values (e.g., <0.01), but the distribution around the 0.05 threshold should still be relatively continuous.\n\nThe described pattern - \"an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 (e.g., .047, .049, .041) for several exploratory analyses, with almost no p-values just above .05\" - is highly suspicious for several reasons:\n\n1. **Statistical improbability**: If analyses were conducted honestly, p-values should distribute somewhat evenly around the 0.05 threshold. Having multiple analyses cluster just below 0.05 while avoiding the just-above range is statistically very unlikely.\n\n2. **The \"cliff effect\"**: The sharp discontinuity at 0.05 suggests selective reporting or manipulation, as this threshold has no special meaning in nature - only in publication decisions.\n\n3. **Exploratory analyses**: The fact that this pattern appears in exploratory (rather than pre-planned) analyses makes it even more suspicious, as these are more susceptible to p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n4. **Multiple instances**: Having several analyses show this pattern compounds the improbability exponentially.\n\nWhile there could be innocent explanations (software issues, analytical choices made in good faith), the specific pattern described is a classic red flag for p-hacking, selective reporting, or data manipulation. The probability of this occurring naturally across multiple exploratory analyses is extremely low.\n\nEven accounting for potential innocent explanations like software changes or miscommunication, this particular statistical signature is so characteristic of manipulation that it would be very unlikely to occur by chance in legitimate research.\n\n15"

If someone is manipulating data or analyses, they would naturally target getting results just below this threshold.\n\n2. **Common manipulation strategies**: \n   - Selectively excluding data points until p < 0.05\n   - Trying multiple analytical approaches and reporting only those yielding p < 0.05\n   - Direct data fabrication/alteration targeting this threshold\n   - Optional stopping (collecting data until reaching significance)\n\n3. **Risk-averse manipulation**: A sophisticated manipulator wouldn't fabricate results with p = 0.001 (too obviously perfect) but would aim for \"believable\" significance levels like 0.04-0.049.\n\n4. **The \"file drawer\" effect**: Results just above 0.05 would be systematically excluded or re-analyzed until they drop below the threshold.\n\n5. **Multiple exploratory analyses**: This provides numerous opportunities to apply questionable practices until the desired pattern emerges.\n\n6. **Pressure context**: Given the high-stakes situation (grant review, top journal, career pressure), there's strong motivation to ensure results appear significant.\n\nThis exact pattern - clustering just below 0.05 with avoidance of just-above values - is so characteristic of p-hacking and data manipulation that it's essentially a textbook example of what misconduct looks like statistically.

PhD students and their supervisors genuinely do face:\n   - Grant funding pressures with real career consequences\n   - Competitive postdoc markets where publications matter enormously\n   - High-stakes studies that can make or break research programs\n\n2. **Normal emotional expression**: Venting to friends about work stress is completely normal human behavior.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be very likely that the lab's data management logs would show her running multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, especially if other students show similar patterns.\n\nHere's why this would be expected in legitimate research:\n\n1. **Standard robustness testing**: Running sensitivity analyses with different exclusion criteria is considered best practice in rigorous research. It demonstrates thoroughness and scientific integrity.\n\n2. **Lab-wide initiative**: The fact that this was part of a \"lab-wide push to explore robustness\" indicates this was encouraged, supervised behavior rather than individual questionable practices.\n\n3. **Peer consistency**: Other students showing similar patterns strongly suggests this reflects legitimate lab protocols rather than misconduct. If multiple researchers independently engaged in the same misconduct, it would be highly unusual.\n\n4. **Transparency through documentation**: Storing and logging multiple scripts demonstrates openness rather than attempting to hide analytical choices. Misconduct typically involves concealing alternative analyses.\n\n5. **Educational value**: PhD training emphasizes learning to test the robustness of findings. Supervisors often encourage students to explore how sensitive results are to different reasonable choices.\n\n6. **Methodological sophistication**: Modern research standards increasingly expect researchers to demonstrate that findings aren't dependent on arbitrary analytical decisions.\n\n7. **Preemptive reviewer responses**: Journals and reviewers often ask about robustness to different exclusion criteria, so preparing these analyses proactively is strategic and appropriate.\n\n8. **Supervised environment**: Lab-wide initiatives imply supervisor awareness and approval of these practices.\n\nThis pattern actually suggests good scientific practice and proper training in rigorous methodology.\n\n88"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it would still be quite likely that the lab's data management logs would show her running multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students.\n\nHere's why this would be expected even if misconduct occurred:\n\n1. **Perfect cover story**: A lab-wide robustness initiative provides ideal camouflage for selective analysis practices. Lena could engage in p-hacking while appearing to follow legitimate lab protocols.\n\n2. **Systematic exploration for optimal results**: Multiple scripts with different criteria would allow her to systematically test which combinations yield significant results, then selectively report the favorable ones.\n\n3. **Peer pressure compliance**: Even while engaging in misconduct, she would likely participate in lab-wide initiatives to avoid suspicion or standing out as non-compliant.\n\n4. **Sophisticated misconduct strategy**: Rather than avoiding robustness testing, someone engaging in misconduct might exploit it - running many analyses and cherry-picking results while claiming it was all part of standard robustness checks.\n\n5. **Maintains legitimate appearance**: Following some lab protocols (like running multiple scripts) helps maintain credibility while engaging in selective reporting or other fraudulent practices.\n\n6. **Opportunistic exploitation**: The lab's emphasis on robustness testing would provide numerous opportunities to find significant results through legitimate-appearing but actually selective processes.\n\n7. **Documentation as alibi**: Storing multiple scripts could serve as evidence of \"thorough analysis\" if questioned, while concealing the selective reporting of only favorable results.\n\n8. **Mixed legitimate/illegitimate behavior**: Misconduct often involves following some proper procedures while violating others, rather than abandoning all legitimate practices.\n\nThe key difference would be in which results get reported, not whether multiple analyses were conducted.\n\n75"

When combined with post-hoc preregistration changes and the documented pressure/motivation, this creates a strong circumstantial case.\n\nHowever, the strong prior track record and some legitimate explanations for individual pieces of evidence provide meaningful counterweight.\n\nThe technical issues and lab practices explain some of the suspicious elements, but don't fully account for the specific statistical patterns that are most problematic.\n\nOn balance, while there are innocent explanations for some elements, the core statistical evidence and preregistration modifications are difficult to explain away and represent textbook signs of research misconduct.\n\n72"

Combined with the post-hoc modification of preregistration documents to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection, this creates a strong pattern consistent with systematic misconduct.\n\nWhile Lena has mitigating factors (strong prior record, some legitimate exclusions, verified technical issues), the core statistical and procedural evidence points to deliberate manipulation rather than honest research practices that happened to produce suspicious patterns by coincidence."
