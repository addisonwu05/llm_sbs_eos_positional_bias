The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The emails reveal that Lena felt pressure due to the study's importance for her supervisor's grant and her own future career prospects. Specifically, she mentioned that her supervisor was relying on the study, a null result would be detrimental to her postdoc chances, and she needed the study to succeed.\n\nThese statements indicate that Lena was under significant pressure to produce a successful outcome. However, feeling pressure to succeed in research or to publish significant results is a common experience among researchers, including those who conduct their research with integrity. The pressure to publish and secure funding is a well-documented stressor in academic environments.\n\nThe content of Lena's emails does not directly imply that she engaged in misconduct. Instead, they reflect her awareness of the stakes associated with the study's outcome. Researchers often feel the weight of their project's potential impact on their careers and the careers of their supervisors or colleagues.\n\nIf Lena had committed academic misconduct, her emails could be interpreted as further evidence of her motivation to manipulate results given her expressed need for the study to succeed. However, the question posits that she did not commit misconduct. In this case, her emails simply reflect the pressure she felt and her genuine concerns about the implications of the study's outcome.\n\nMany honest researchers might express similar sentiments under the same circumstances, as the pressure to publish and the importance of study outcomes are common in academic settings. Thus, it is plausible that Lena, if innocent of misconduct, would still express these sentiments due to the genuine pressures she was under.\n\nTherefore, considering the context and the common experiences of researchers, it is quite likely that Lena would write such emails even if she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

In this context, her emails expressing pressure and a need for the study to succeed take on a different connotation. They could be seen as indicative of her motivation to engage in misconduct, as she explicitly states her need for a successful outcome.\n\nIndividuals who commit academic misconduct often do so because they feel pressured to achieve certain results, whether due to career advancement, financial, or reputational reasons. By expressing that she \"needs this one to work,\" Lena is articulating a motive that could justify or explain misconduct.\n\nHowever, the act of committing misconduct and the act of expressing pressure or motivation in emails are somewhat independent. A person committing misconduct might still be cautious about expressing their true feelings or motivations in writing, especially if they are aware that emails can be scrutinized.\n\nDespite this, individuals who engage in misconduct are not always cautious or calculating in their communications. Some might be more open about their pressures and motivations, either because they are not thinking about the potential consequences of their emails or because they feel a need to share their stress or concerns with someone they trust.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is still plausible that she would express the sentiments found in her emails, as these reflect real pressures she was under. However, one might argue that someone committing misconduct might be less likely to leave a clear paper trail of their motivations.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems reasonably likely that Lena would still write such emails even if she committed misconduct, as her statements reflect genuine concerns and pressures common in her situation.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"
