The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, there must be an innocent explanation for this action.\n\nOne possible innocent explanation is that Lena or someone else genuinely forgot that the data had already been collected when they modified the preregistration document. However, this is unlikely because preregistration is typically done before data collection to prevent exactly this kind of issue.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the modification was done for a legitimate reason that isn't related to manipulating the outcomes, such as correcting an oversight in the initial preregistration that didn't align with the actual data collection plan or making a minor, non-substantive change.\n\nHowever, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection, even if done innocently, undermines the purpose of preregistration. It's also unusual to modify a preregistration document in such a significant way after data collection has begun or been completed.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is unlikely that she would modify the preregistration document in such a significant manner after data collection. The action of modifying a preregistration document after data has been collected to change key aspects of the analysis plan is not typical of standard, transparent research practices.\n\nThe likelihood of this happening without misconduct is low.\n\n**80** is too high because it suggests a relatively high likelihood of an innocent explanation, which isn't the case here.
