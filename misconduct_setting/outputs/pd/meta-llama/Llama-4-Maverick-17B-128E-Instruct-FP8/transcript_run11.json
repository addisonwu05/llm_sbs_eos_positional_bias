The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The pressure to produce publishable findings, especially in a high-stakes environment like a PhD program with a significant grant review looming, is real. Many students and researchers face similar pressures. Lena's supervisor being \"counting on this study to save the grant\" is a statement that reflects the high stakes of the research, which is a common situation in academia. Similarly, a null result potentially hurting her postdoc chances is a realistic concern given the competitive nature of securing postdoctoral positions. Saying \"I need this one to work\" can be interpreted as a reflection of her awareness of these stakes rather than an admission or indication of intent to manipulate data.\n\nThus, the emails could be seen as a genuine expression of her concerns and pressures rather than evidence of misconduct. Researchers often discuss the pressure to publish and the implications of their results on their careers without intending to imply they will cheat.\n\n60"

Nevertheless, an unusually high concentration just below .05, with a dearth of values just above .05, is suspicious and not typically expected under honest reporting of analyses.\n\nSome researchers might argue that this could occur due to various factors not related to misconduct, such as a specific pattern of data or an unusual distribution of effect sizes. However, such a pattern can also be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are manipulated or selectively reported based on their results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still possible but less likely that the final dataset would exhibit such a suspicious pattern, especially if there was no p-hacking or selective reporting.
