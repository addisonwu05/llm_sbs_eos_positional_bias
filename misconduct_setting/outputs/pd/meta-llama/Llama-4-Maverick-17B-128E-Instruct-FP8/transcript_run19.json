The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

However, the concentration of p-values just below the .05 threshold is unusual and can be a cause for suspicion.\n\nIn a genuine dataset, we would expect the distribution of p-values to be more uniform or follow a pattern expected under the null or alternative hypothesis, depending on the context. The observed clustering just below .05, with a noticeable absence of values just above .05, is suggestive of a phenomenon known as \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where analyses or data are manipulated to achieve statistical significance.\n\nHowever, there are alternative explanations that do not involve misconduct. For instance, the analyses conducted might have been genuinely guided by strong theoretical expectations or prior evidence, leading to a concentration of significant results. Additionally, the distribution of p-values can be influenced by the specific statistical tests used, the sample size, and the effect sizes.\n\nThat being said, the described pattern is still unusual and warrants scrutiny. Research has shown that in the absence of p-hacking or other biases, the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis is uniform, and under the alternative hypothesis, it tends to be skewed towards zero. However, a sharp drop-off just above .05 is not typically expected in genuine, unbiased research.\n\nGiven that there are plausible non-misconduct explanations and considering the complexity of real-world data analysis (e.g., iterative model fitting, genuine exploratory analyses guided by strong prior hypotheses), it's not impossible to observe such a pattern without misconduct.\n\nTo quantify the likelihood, we must consider the balance between the suspicious nature of the observed pattern and the potential for it arising from legitimate practices or chance.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

Moreover, p-hacking involves manipulating analyses or data until a significant result is obtained, which would likely result in a cluster of p-values just below the .05 threshold.\n\nResearch on academic misconduct and questionable research practices has highlighted that such behaviors can lead to an excess of statistically significant results and a suspicious distribution of p-values.
