The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Preregistration is a process where researchers detail their study's methodology, hypotheses, and analysis plan before collecting data to ensure transparency and reduce the potential for bias or manipulation of results. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, generally raises suspicions because it could be a sign of attempting to align the study's reported plan with the actual analysis conducted after seeing the data.\n\nHowever, there are plausible innocent explanations for such a modification. For instance, it could be due to a genuine misunderstanding or miscommunication about the importance of updating the preregistration document to reflect changes in the study's design or analysis plan that were decided upon before seeing the data but not formally documented until later. Another possibility is that the changes were made to reflect actual methodological decisions that were made during data collection or before data analysis, and the modifications were not made with the intention of falsely representing the research process.\n\nDespite these possibilities, the practice of altering a preregistration document after data collection goes against standard practices aimed at maintaining the integrity and transparency of research. Preregistration is meant to be a time-stamped record of the research plan before data are seen, and changing it afterward, even if done without malintent, undermines this principle.\n\nGiven the context that Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling and insists that any irregularities were due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, one might consider the possibility that the modification was not made with the intent to deceive. However, the act of modifying the preregistration document after data collection is unusual and, under normal circumstances, not considered a standard or recommended practice.\n\nTherefore, while not impossible, it is unlikely that the preregistration document would be modified after data collection without any intent to manipulate the research findings, as it contradicts the purpose and spirit of preregistration.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This behavior is considered a form of research misconduct because it misrepresents the research process and can lead to false-positive findings.\n\nIf Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is reasonable to assume that she might engage in other questionable research practices, such as altering the preregistration document, to avoid detection or to strengthen the appearance of her findings.
