The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider a few key aspects of statistical analysis and research practices.\n\n1. **Understanding p-values**: p-values represent the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A p-value of .05 is a common threshold for significance, meaning that if the null hypothesis is true, there's a 5% chance of observing the test statistic (or a more extreme value).\n\n2. **Distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis**: When the null hypothesis is true, p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means that, theoretically, the probability of a p-value falling between .04 and .05 is the same as it falling between .05 and .06, which is 0.01 (or 1%) for each interval.\n\n3. **The phenomenon described**: The observation that there are many p-values just below .05 and almost none just above .05 is unusual because, under normal circumstances (and assuming the null hypothesis is true or the effects are very small), we would expect a relatively uniform distribution around .05.\n\n4. **Possible explanations without misconduct**: Several factors could potentially lead to this pattern without intentional manipulation:\n   - **Optional stopping**: If the data analysis was done in a way that involved stopping data collection based on achieving significance, this could potentially skew the distribution. However, this typically requires knowing the p-value or the test statistic and its associated p-value during data collection, and adjusting the sample size accordingly.\n   - **Analytical choices and flexibility**: Researchers often have multiple choices in how to analyze their data, including which statistical tests to use, how to handle outliers, etc. If these choices are made based on the results (e.g., trying different analyses until one yields a significant result), this can lead to an inflated rate of false positives and potentially a clustering of p-values just below .05. However, this \"researcher degrees of freedom\" issue doesn't directly explain the specific pattern unless it involves selectively reporting or adjusting analyses to just achieve significance.\n   - **Genuine effects**: If the theory being tested is correct and there are real effects, we might expect more p-values to be significant. However, the specific clustering just below .05 can still be suspicious.\n\n5. **Evaluating the likelihood**: The described pattern is somewhat indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that can be considered a form of academic misconduct if they involve manipulating the analysis or reporting to achieve a desired level of significance. However, not all irregularities or unexpected patterns are due to misconduct; they can also result from honest errors, misunderstandings, or unforeseen consequences of legitimate practices.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the pattern of having many p-values just below .05 and few just above it could still occur due to a combination of real effects and legitimate analytical choices. However, the specific pattern described is unusual and could be a red flag for potential issues with the research practices.\n\nTo quantify the likelihood: A 2020 study suggested that the distribution of p-values can be influenced by various biases and researcher behaviors, potentially leading to an excess of p-values just below .05. However, without more detailed statistical analysis or context, it's challenging to assign a precise probability.\n\nThe probability that the observed pattern occurs without misconduct is not straightforward to calculate directly from the information given. However, intuitively, one might expect that such a pattern, while suspicious, is not extremely rare in contexts where analyses are exploratory and there are real effects.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, specifically by manipulating the data or analyses to achieve significant results, this could directly influence the distribution of p-values.\n\n1. **Manipulation to achieve significance**: One common form of misconduct is \"p-hacking,\" which involves adjusting the analysis or data until a significant p-value is achieved. This can include selectively reporting results, excluding data points to achieve significance, or choosing statistical tests that yield significant results.\n\n2. **Expected outcome of misconduct**: If Lena manipulated the data or analyses to achieve significant results, we would expect to see patterns in the data or p-values that reflect this manipulation. A high concentration of p-values just below .05 with few just above it is a pattern that could result from such manipulation, as it suggests that analyses were adjusted or results were selectively reported to be just significant.\n\n3. **Likelihood of the observed pattern**: The observed pattern is consistent with what one might expect if there was manipulation aimed at achieving significance. It is a suspicious pattern because it suggests that some form of selective reporting or adjustment was made to achieve p-values below the .05 threshold.\n\n4. **Quantifying the likelihood**: The likelihood that the dataset shows this pattern given misconduct is higher because the behavior (misconduct) directly aims to or can result in such a distribution.\n\nGiven the considerations above, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 is relatively high.

These statements reflect a high level of pressure and personal investment.\n\n2. **Pressure and stakes in research**: It's common for researchers to feel pressure to produce significant or publishable results, especially when their career advancement is tied to such outcomes.

The emails reflect this kind of pressure.\n\n2. **Awareness of pressure and actions taken**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it's likely that she was under significant pressure to achieve certain outcomes, as her emails suggest. This pressure could be a motivating factor for misconduct.\n\n3. **Likelihood of expressing pressure**: Individuals who engage in misconduct may still express their feelings of pressure and the importance of achieving certain results in private communications. The fact that Lena wrote about the pressure and her need for the study to succeed is consistent with the kind of mindset that might lead someone to consider or engage in misconduct to achieve their goals.\n\n4. **Caution and awareness of being caught**: However, one might argue that someone committing misconduct might be cautious about expressing their true feelings or motivations in writing, to avoid leaving a paper trail. On the other hand, emails to a friend might be considered a relatively safe outlet for expressing true feelings.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still likely that she would express her feelings of pressure and the stakes involved in the study, as these feelings could be part of the motivation for her actions.

These criteria can be based on various factors such as the participants' performance in the task, demographic characteristics, or data quality issues.\n\n2. **Reasons for excluding participants**: Participants might be excluded due to failure to meet inclusion criteria, technical issues during data collection, poor data quality, or not completing the study as required.\n\n3. **Changes in analysis plans**: Researchers often refine their analysis plans as they examine their data.

This is done to enhance transparency and reduce the potential for biases such as HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) or p-hacking.\n\n2. **Modifying preregistration documents**: Ideally, a preregistered plan should not be altered after data collection has started or been completed. Modifications after data collection could undermine the purpose of preregistration by allowing the analysis to be influenced by the observed data.\n\n3. **Legitimate reasons for modification**: While the ideal is for preregistration plans to remain unchanged, there might be exceptional circumstances where changes are necessary, such as unforeseen issues with the data or methodology that become apparent only after data collection has begun. However, such changes should be transparently documented and justified.\n\n4. **Modifying after data collection**: Modifying the preregistration document after data collection without a compelling reason and transparent documentation could be seen as questionable.

This behavior is consistent with good research practices aimed at ensuring the robustness of findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

If this was a common practice, then Lena's actions, even if she committed misconduct, could still be consistent with this lab culture.\n\n2. **Misconduct and analysis practices**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it might involve selectively reporting or manipulating results. However, running multiple analyses with different exclusion criteria could be part of either a legitimate robustness check or an attempt to find a desirable result through multiple testing.\n\n3. **Similarity to other students' practices**: The fact that other students showed similar patterns suggests that running multiple analyses was a common practice. This makes it more plausible that Lena's actions were part of this culture, regardless of whether she committed misconduct.\n\n4. **Likelihood of showing multiple analysis scripts**: If Lena did commit misconduct by selectively analyzing or reporting data, she might still have run multiple analyses as part of her process. The fact that her logs show multiple scripts could be consistent with this behavior.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is still likely that the lab's data management logs would show her running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts, as this behavior is consistent with both legitimate robustness checks and potential misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

Running multiple analysis scripts is consistent with lab practices and not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\n5. **Previous good record**: Lena's previous studies were well-documented and passed an independent audit, suggesting a history of good research practices.\n\n6. **Lab culture and practices**: The lab's culture of exploring robustness through multiple analyses is a mitigating factor, as it provides a context in which running multiple scripts is a normal practice.\n\nConsidering these points, there are both indicators of potential misconduct (suspicious p-value distribution, modification of preregistration) and evidence suggesting that Lena followed good research practices (legitimate exclusion of participants, previous good record, consistent with lab culture). The presence of both types of evidence complicates the assessment.\n\nWhile there are red flags, there are also plausible explanations for many of the observations that do not involve misconduct. The probability of misconduct should consider the likelihood of these alternative explanations.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
