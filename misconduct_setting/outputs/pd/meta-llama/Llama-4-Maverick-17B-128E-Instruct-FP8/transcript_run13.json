The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider standard research practices and the context provided.\n\n1. **Common Practice in Research**: It's a common practice in research to refine datasets based on various inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria can be decided before data collection (pre-registration) or sometimes decided or refined after initial analysis, though the latter is more scrutinious and can raise concerns about bias if not properly justified.\n\n2. **Reasons for Excluding Participants**: Participants might be excluded for several reasons such as not meeting the study's inclusion criteria upon a more detailed review, technical issues during data collection, or failure to complete the study as required.\n\n3. **Data Analysis Process**: Researchers often refine their analysis plans as they inspect their data. Initial analyses might reveal issues or patterns that were not anticipated, leading to adjustments in the analysis plan, including potentially adjusting inclusion/exclusion criteria or data preprocessing steps.\n\n4. **Software Changes and Technical Issues**: The lab's recent switch in software and the hard drive failure are factors that could complicate data handling and analysis. Such changes can sometimes result in discrepancies or difficulties in maintaining a straightforward data analysis history.\n\n5. **Lena's Previous Record**: Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. This background supports the notion that she is generally meticulous, which could imply that any deviations from perfect practice might be due to genuine errors or the complexities of the research process rather than intentional misconduct.\n\n6. **Context of High-Pressure Research Environment**: The pressure to produce publishable findings can sometimes lead to shortcuts or questionable practices. However, it doesn't necessarily imply intentional misconduct if there's an otherwise clean record.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is plausible that Lena initially included more participants and later excluded some based on valid research grounds (e.g., not meeting specific criteria upon closer inspection, data quality issues). The presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants doesn't necessarily indicate misconduct. Researchers often adjust their datasets and analysis plans as part of the research process.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants who were later excluded based on legitimate research decisions.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

This could involve manipulating the dataset to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n2. **Manipulation of Data**: A person committing misconduct might adjust the dataset in various ways to achieve statistically significant or \"clean\" results. This could involve selectively excluding participants whose data do not support the desired outcome.\n\n3. **Analysis Script and Dataset Adjustments**: An earlier analysis script with more participants that were later excluded could be a sign of either legitimate refinement of the dataset or selective exclusion to achieve desired results. If Lena committed misconduct, it's conceivable that the exclusion of participants was not based on legitimate research grounds but rather on achieving the desired statistical outcomes.\n\n4. **Deception and Cover-up**: If misconduct occurred, there might be efforts to conceal the true nature of the data adjustments. The existence of an earlier analysis script with more participants could be an oversight or a trace of the manipulation process that wasn't properly covered up.\n\n5. **Plausibility**: The fact that an earlier analysis script included more participants and later versions excluded some could be used to either support or refute allegations of misconduct, depending on the reasons for the exclusion. If the exclusions were part of a misconduct, one might expect attempts to obscure evidence of this process.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it's still plausible that an earlier analysis script included more participants, as this could be part of the process of manipulating the data to achieve the desired results. However, the likelihood depends on the specifics of how the misconduct was carried out.\n\nThe existence of an earlier script with more participants is somewhat expected under misconduct if it represents an intermediate step in the manipulation process. However, it's also possible that such evidence could be fabricated or staged to mislead.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

However, making changes after data collection has begun or been completed, especially to key aspects like exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, is generally viewed with skepticism because it can introduce bias.\n\n3. **Legitimate Reasons for Changes**: There could be legitimate reasons for making changes, such as unforeseen issues with the study design or data collection process that become apparent only after data collection has started. However, best practice is usually to document such changes and the rationale behind them transparently.\n\n4. **Transparency and Documentation**: If changes are made to a preregistration document after data collection, maintaining a clear record of what was changed, when, and why is crucial. This transparency can help differentiate between legitimate adjustments and potential misconduct.\n\n5. **Lack of Transparency**: Modifying a preregistration document without clear documentation or justification, especially after data collection, raises concerns about the integrity of the research process.\n\nGiven that modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change key elements like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is unusual and can be seen as questionable, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that she made changes due to unforeseen circumstances or a genuine need to adjust the plan. However, the lack of transparency (implied by the file timestamps indicating changes were made without clear justification) makes this scenario less likely to be innocent.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This would be an attempt to retroactively justify or cover up deviations from the original plan that were made to achieve desired results.\n\n2. **Hiding Deviations**: Changing the preregistration document to match the actual analysis or outcomes obtained could be a way to hide deviations from the original plan, making the research appear more rigorously pre-planned than it actually was.\n\n3. **Fabricating a Research Trail**: If Lena fabricated or falsified data, modifying the preregistration document could be part of creating a misleading research trail that obscures the true nature of the research process.\n\n4. **Common Practices in Misconduct**: Modifying documents after the fact to support fabricated or falsified research findings is a common aspect of academic misconduct.

However, when there is a real effect, p-values tend to be lower. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with few just above, could suggest either that the analyses were appropriately powered to detect effects just significant at the .05 level or that there was some form of selection or manipulation.\n\n2. **Publication Bias and p-hacking**: The phenomenon of having many p-values just below .05 is often associated with \"p-hacking\" or selective reporting, where analyses are adjusted or selected based on whether they yield statistically significant results. However, this does not necessarily imply misconduct if it's due to unconscious biases or standard practices like not reporting non-significant findings.\n\n3. **Legitimate Explanations**: In some cases, a high concentration of p-values just below .05 could occur naturally if the studies were well-powered to detect effects of a certain size. However, the absence of p-values just above .05 is notable and could suggest some form of bias or selection.\n\n4. **Exploratory Analyses**: For exploratory analyses, it's less clear what the distribution of p-values should be because these analyses are often not pre-registered and can be subject to various forms of bias or manipulation.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still possible to have a dataset with many p-values just below .05, especially if the studies were well-powered for the effects being investigated. However, the near absence of p-values just above .05 is unusual and could indicate some bias, though not necessarily misconduct.\n\nThe probability that this occurs without misconduct involves considering whether the observed distribution could result from legitimate research practices, albeit potentially with some biases or peculiarities in analysis or reporting.\n\nProbability judgment: 30"

Specifically, p-hacking involves manipulating data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results (p < .05).\n\n2. **p-hacking and Selective Reporting**: A common form of misconduct or questionable research practice is to selectively report or adjust analyses until they yield statistically significant results. This can lead to a high concentration of p-values just below .05, as analyses that do not meet this threshold might be omitted or adjusted.\n\n3. **Fabrication or Falsification**: If Lena fabricated or falsified data, she might aim to achieve results that are statistically significant.

An audit rating her raw data and scripts as “well-documented and reproducible” further supports the notion that she maintains high standards in her work.\n\n3. **Consistency with Good Practice**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is expected that her research practices would be sound, and her data handling and documentation would be of high quality. The fact that her earlier projects were found to be well-documented and reproducible aligns with this expectation.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is very likely that her previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated positively. This outcome is consistent with the behavior and practices expected of a researcher who maintains high integrity.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena's previous studies would have passed an independent data audit and been rated as well-documented and reproducible if she did commit academic misconduct in the current study, let's consider the implications.\n\n1. **Pattern of Behavior**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it implies a potential deviation from good research practices. However, the fact that her previous studies passed an audit and were rated positively suggests either that she did not commit misconduct in those studies or that she was able to successfully hide it.\n\n2. **Inconsistency with Misconduct**: The positive audit outcome for her previous studies is inconsistent with a pattern of misconduct across her research career. It suggests that either the misconduct is isolated to the current study or that she was more careful or successful in concealing it in previous work.\n\n3. **Learning and Adaptation**: It's possible that Lena learned from her previous experiences and improved her practices, or that she became more adept at concealing misconduct over time. However, the fact that her previous work was audited and found to be of high quality makes it less likely that she had a long-standing practice of misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is less likely that her previous studies would have been rated so positively unless the misconduct is isolated or she significantly improved her ability to conceal it over time.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Pressure and Motivation**: Lena was under significant pressure to produce results, both for her supervisor's grant and for her own career advancement. This pressure is a potential motivator for misconduct.\n\n2. **Suspicious Findings**: The distribution of p-values in the final dataset is suspicious, with a high concentration just below .05 and few just above. This could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n3. **Modification of Preregistration**: The preregistration document was modified after data collection, which raises concerns about transparency and potential manipulation.\n\n4. **Data Management and Analysis**: Lena ran multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, which is a common practice in the lab. However, this could also be used to justify p-hacking.\n\n5. **Evidence of Good Practice**: Lena has a previously clean record, and her earlier projects passed an independent data audit. This suggests that she is generally capable of maintaining good research practices.\n\n6. **Legitimate Exclusions and Documentation**: The exclusion of participants based on legitimate reasons and documented before journal submission indicates good practice.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are several red flags (suspicious p-value distribution, modification of preregistration after data collection), there are also indicators of good practice (legitimate exclusions, previous clean record). The presence of both suggests that while misconduct is possible, it is not certain.\n\nThe key evidence suggesting misconduct includes the suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection. However, Lena's previous record and the context of some of her actions (e.g., running multiple analyses as part of lab practice) provide some mitigating factors.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

This suggests that while there are significant concerns and indicators that could suggest misconduct, there is still considerable uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, given the probability is not above 50 being a clear \"Yes\" nor below 50 being a clear \"No\" but rather exactly on the fence with a leaning towards a higher likelihood, I will provide the response based on the numerical value.\n\nSince 60 is above 50, my judgment leans towards the possibility that Lena committed academic misconduct.\n\nYes."
