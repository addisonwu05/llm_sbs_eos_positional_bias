The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider common practices in research data analysis and the context provided.\n\n1. **Common Practice in Data Analysis**: In research, it's a standard practice to refine datasets based on various criteria such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, data quality, outliers, etc., after initial data collection. This process often involves preliminary analyses to determine which data points or participants should be included in the final analysis to ensure the research question is addressed effectively.\n\n2. **Participant Exclusion**: Researchers often exclude participants based on predefined criteria (e.g., failure to complete the task, technical issues during data collection, not meeting the demographic criteria, etc.). The decision to exclude participants can occur at various stages, including during data preprocessing or after initial analyses if certain conditions or thresholds are not met.\n\n3. **Changes in Analysis Plans**: It's not uncommon for analysis plans to evolve as researchers delve deeper into their data. Initial analyses might reveal issues or suggest alternative approaches that better address the research hypothesis. Adjusting the analysis plan, including deciding to exclude certain participants based on new information or insights gained during the analysis process, is a part of the iterative process of research.\n\n4. **Use of Earlier Versions of Analysis Scripts**: The fact that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants and was later modified could simply reflect the normal evolution of data analysis in research projects. Researchers may initially analyze data with a broader set of participants and later refine this based on various checks (e.g., checking for outliers, assessing whether participants understood the task).\n\n5. **Lena’s Integrity**: The premise here is that Lena did not commit academic misconduct. Therefore, any changes to the dataset or analysis plan should be assumed to be based on legitimate research reasons rather than an intent to deceive or manipulate results.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that an earlier analysis script included more participants who were later excluded based on legitimate research criteria or methodological decisions. The presence of an earlier version of the analysis script with more participants is consistent with standard research practices, where initial analyses might include a broader dataset that is later refined.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we must consider the motivations and behaviors associated with academic misconduct, particularly in the context of data manipulation or fabrication.\n\n1. **Fabrication or Falsification**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it implies that she might have manipulated or fabricated data to achieve desired results. In such cases, the exclusion of certain participants could be part of a strategy to enhance the appearance of the results or to make the data fit the hypothesis more neatly.\n\n2. **Selective Reporting**: Academic misconduct can involve selectively reporting results or manipulating the dataset to exclude data points that contradict the desired outcome. An earlier analysis script with more participants that were later excluded could be indicative of this practice, especially if the exclusion was not based on pre-defined, legitimate criteria.\n\n3. **Evidence of Manipulation**: The existence of an earlier version of the analysis script with more participants could be seen as evidence that Lena was experimenting with different datasets or analysis strategies. If Lena was engaging in misconduct, this could be part of an effort to \"optimize\" the results.\n\n4. **Plausible Deniability**: However, if Lena was intentionally manipulating data, she might also be expected to cover her tracks. The presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants might not necessarily be a straightforward indication of misconduct, as it could be argued to be part of a legitimate analysis process. Nonetheless, the fact that such a script exists and shows differences from the final analysis could raise suspicions.\n\n5. **Investigative Context**: In the context of an investigation into academic misconduct, the existence of an earlier analysis script with more participants is a red flag that warrants scrutiny. It suggests that there was a process of refining or altering the dataset, which could be legitimate but also could be part of a larger pattern of misconduct.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants could still be consistent with various scenarios, including both legitimate analysis refinement and data manipulation. However, the likelihood that such a script existed as part of a legitimate process might be lower if misconduct occurred, as one might expect more efforts to conceal evidence of manipulation.\n\nProbability judgment: 60"

It's common for researchers to feel pressure to produce significant or publishable results, especially when their career advancement is tied to such outcomes.\n\n2. **Expression of Stress and Motivation**: Lena's statements could be seen as expressions of her stress and motivation. Researchers often share their concerns and pressures with friends or peers as a way of coping.\n\n3. **Career Concerns**: The mention of a null result affecting her postdoc chances is a realistic concern in the competitive environment of academic research. Early-career researchers often face significant pressure to publish impactful research to secure future positions.\n\n4. **Honest Expression of Feelings**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, her emails could be a genuine expression of her feelings and concerns about the study's outcome and its implications for her career. It reflects her investment in the project's success without necessarily implying any wrongdoing.\n\n5. **Behavior Consistent with Non-Misconduct**: Researchers under pressure might express frustration or determination without engaging in misconduct. The emails could indicate that Lena is highly invested in her work and concerned about its outcomes, which is consistent with a genuine, albeit stressed, researcher.\n\nConsidering these factors, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that she would express her concerns and the pressure she feels in emails to a friend. Such expressions are common among researchers facing high stakes and do not directly imply any wrongdoing.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This pressure could potentially motivate someone to engage in academic misconduct if they felt that a null result would have severe consequences for their career or the grant.\n\n2. **Awareness of Consequences**: Lena's statements indicate she is aware of the high stakes and that a failure could have significant consequences. This awareness could motivate misconduct as a means to avoid these consequences.\n\n3. **Lack of Caution**: If Lena did commit academic misconduct, one might expect her to be cautious in her communications, potentially avoiding explicit statements about the pressure she's under or her desire for the study to succeed. However, individuals committing misconduct are not always cautious or aware of the potential consequences of their communications.\n\n4. **Psychological Factors**: People under pressure may express their stress or concerns openly, even if they are engaging in misconduct. The act of committing misconduct doesn't necessarily mean someone will be cautious in all their communications.\n\n5. **Honesty in Private Communications**: It's possible for someone to be honest about their feelings and pressures in private communications, even if they are engaging in misconduct. This honesty doesn't necessarily correlate directly with their likelihood of committing misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it's still plausible that she would express her genuine feelings of pressure and concern in private emails. The act of expressing pressure or a desire for success doesn't directly imply guilt or innocence regarding misconduct, as both individuals who commit misconduct and those who do not can feel and express such sentiments.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

However, when the alternative hypothesis is true, p-values tend to be skewed towards 0.\n\n2. **Significance Level and p-value Distribution**: The concentration of p-values just below .05 could occur naturally if the effects being tested are real and the study is well-powered. However, an unusually high concentration just below .05, with a noticeable absence of values just above .05, is not typically expected under normal circumstances.\n\n3. **Publication Bias and the \"File Drawer Problem\"**: The phenomenon of having many p-values just below .05 is sometimes associated with publication bias, where studies or analyses with p-values above .05 are less likely to be reported or published. However, this doesn't directly apply to the distribution within a single dataset or study.\n\n4. **Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)**: Even without intentional misconduct, QRPs (such as selectively reporting analyses or outcomes) can lead to a biased distribution of p-values. However, the specific pattern described could also be indicative of more deliberate manipulation.\n\n5. **Statistical Fluctuations**: In a finite number of tests, statistical fluctuations can occur. However, an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is not typically a result of chance alone.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, one would generally expect the distribution of p-values to reflect the underlying effects and the statistical power of the study. While it's not impossible to observe a concentration of p-values just below .05 by chance or due to real effects, an unusually high concentration with a \"gap\" just above .05 might still raise suspicions.\n\nHowever, without strong evidence of manipulation, it's also possible to attribute such a distribution to other factors, including real effects being tested or chance, although the latter is less likely for an \"unusually high concentration.\"\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might have manipulated the data or analyses to achieve significant results.\n\n2. **p-hacking**: One form of misconduct or QRPs (Questionable Research Practices) is \"p-hacking,\" where researchers selectively report or manipulate analyses to achieve p-values below .05.

This is because the goal of such practices is often to achieve statistical significance.\n\n4. **Absence of p-values Just Above .05**: The absence of p-values just above .05, combined with a high concentration just below, is consistent with the practice of selectively stopping data analysis or reporting when the p-value is significant, or manipulating data to cross the .05 threshold.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is more likely that the final dataset would show an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05.

This is done to enhance transparency and reduce the potential for bias by pre-specifying the research plan.\n\n2. **Modifying Preregistration**: While the ideal practice is to finalize the preregistration before data collection, it's not uncommon for minor adjustments to be needed.

Independent audits are rigorous and designed to test the robustness and reproducibility of research.\n\n3. **Documentation and Reproducibility**: Being rated as \"well-documented and reproducible\" indicates that Lena's research methods and data were transparent and adhered to high standards. This is a hallmark of responsible and reliable research.\n\n4. **Consistency with Innocence**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is entirely consistent that her previous work would be found to be of high quality, well-documented, and reproducible. This aligns with the expectation that researchers who adhere to good practices will produce work that stands up to scrutiny.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is highly likely that her previous studies would have been found to be in good standing during an independent audit.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

However, the fact that her previous studies passed an audit suggests that either the misconduct is a recent development or it was not detectable in those previous studies.\n\n2. **Independence of Past Actions**: The outcome of previous audits and the quality of past research do not necessarily predict future behavior. Researchers can change their practices or behaviors over time.\n\n3. **Previous Good Practices**: The fact that Lena's previous studies were well-documented and reproducible indicates that, at the time, she was following good research practices. This does not directly inform us about her behavior in the current case but suggests that she was capable of and had previously engaged in proper research conduct.\n\n4. **Lack of Direct Correlation**: There is no direct correlation between committing misconduct in one study and the quality or integrity of previous work. Misconduct can be an isolated incident.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is still possible that her previous studies were of high quality and passed an independent audit, as these are separate instances.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena committed academic misconduct based on the given evidence, let's synthesize the key points.\n\n1. **Suspicious Patterns and Evidence**: Several pieces of evidence raise suspicions, such as the unusual distribution of p-values, the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and the initial concerns about the data \"looking too perfect.\" These could indicate potential misconduct.\n\n2. **Legitimate Explanations**: However, there are also plausible explanations for these observations that do not involve misconduct. The lab's practices, such as exploring robustness by running multiple analyses, and the occurrence of a hard drive failure, provide context that could mitigate some concerns.\n\n3. **Lena's Record**: Lena's previous studies have been audited and found to be well-documented and reproducible, suggesting a history of good research practices.\n\n4. **Pressure and Motivations**: Lena faced significant pressure due to the importance of the study for her career and the lab's grant. This pressure could potentially motivate misconduct, but it is also a common experience for many researchers.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there are suspicious circumstances and pressures that could have motivated misconduct, there are also legitimate explanations for many of the observed phenomena. The presence of a clean record and evidence of good practices in previous studies complicates the picture, suggesting that if misconduct occurred, it might not be part of a larger pattern.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
