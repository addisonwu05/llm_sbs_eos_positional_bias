The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given that the preregistration document was modified after data collection, we must consider the implications of such an action and alternative explanations.\n\nPreregistration is a process where researchers document their study design, hypotheses, and analysis plan before collecting data. This is done to enhance transparency and prevent practices like p-hacking or selectively reporting outcomes that are statistically significant. Modifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, any modifications to the preregistration document after data collection would likely be due to honest errors or misunderstandings rather than an intent to deceive. However, changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data could be seen as a form of data-dependent analysis, which preregistration is meant to prevent.\n\nThere are a few possible innocent explanations for modifying a preregistration document post-data collection:\n1. **Misunderstanding of the preregistration process:** Lena might not fully understand that the preregistration document should not be altered after data collection begins. However, this is a basic aspect of the preregistration process, and researchers are generally expected to be aware of it.\n\n2. **Technical or administrative reasons:** The change could be due to a technical issue or an administrative error not related to the data itself. However, changing the content related to exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is not typically something that would be done for such reasons.\n\n3. **Updating to reflect original intentions more accurately:** It's possible, though not a strong justification, that Lena might argue she was updating the document to better reflect the original analysis plan that was not perfectly captured initially.\n\nHowever, these explanations are not very plausible for changing key aspects like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, as these actions directly relate to how the data are analyzed and interpreted.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is relatively unlikely that she would modify the preregistration document in such a significant way after data collection without a compelling innocent reason.\n\nThe modification of a preregistration document to change key aspects like exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is not typical of standard, transparent research practice. The probability that this happened without any intent to manipulate the outcome (i.e., without academic misconduct) is low because such changes can significantly impact the interpretation and validity of the study findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 10"
