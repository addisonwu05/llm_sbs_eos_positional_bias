    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The observation that the final dataset shows an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 can be interpreted in several ways. \n\nFirst, let's consider the scenario where Lena did not commit academic misconduct. In this case, the data and analyses are assumed to be genuine and free from intentional manipulation.\n\nThe distribution of p-values is expected to be uniform under the null hypothesis (when there's no real effect). However, when there are real effects, p-values tend to be lower, and their distribution becomes skewed towards zero. The observed concentration of p-values just below .05 might initially suggest p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct.\n\nHowever, there are alternative explanations that do not involve misconduct. For instance, researchers might genuinely test multiple hypotheses that are informed by theory or prior evidence, and it is plausible that many of these hypotheses are correct, leading to a higher frequency of significant results. \n\nMoreover, if the analyses were pre-registered or if the researchers were transparent about their exploratory analyses, the concern about p-hacking would be mitigated. \n\nDespite these considerations, the unusual pattern of p-values could still occur by chance or due to factors like the specific research design or the underlying effect sizes.\n\nTo assess the likelihood of observing this pattern without misconduct, we can consider that the distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis (when there is a real effect) is not necessarily uniform and can be influenced by factors like the power of the study and the true effect sizes.\n\nStatistical simulations and research on p-value distributions suggest that when there are real effects, it's not uncommon to see a higher concentration of p-values below .05, and the absence of p-values just above .05 might not be extremely unusual, especially if the study is well-powered.\n\nGiven these considerations and assuming Lena did not commit misconduct, the likelihood that the dataset shows this pattern isn't negligible. However, quantifying this likelihood precisely requires more specific information about the study's design, the expected effect sizes, and the distribution of p-values under various hypotheses.\n\nWhile there's no straightforward statistical test to provide a definitive probability for this scenario, a qualitative judgment can be made.\n\nThe probability that the final dataset would show this pattern without misconduct is low to moderate because, although there are plausible explanations that don't involve misconduct, the observed pattern is still unusual and could be a red flag.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

    "content": "If Lena committed academic misconduct, such as p-hacking or selective reporting, it would likely result in a distribution of p-values that is biased towards being just significant (i.e., just below .05). This is because one common form of misconduct involves manipulating the data or analyses to achieve statistical significance.\n\nWhen researchers engage in p-hacking, they might continue to analyze the data in different ways until they achieve a p-value below .05. This can lead to an unusual concentration of p-values just below the significance threshold and a relative absence of p-values just above it, as analyses that yield non-significant results are not reported or are altered.\n\nThe described pattern in the p-values (many just below .05 and few just above) is consistent with what might be expected if someone had engaged in selective reporting or manipulation of analyses to achieve significant results.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that the final dataset would exhibit this pattern, as it aligns with common outcomes associated with such practices.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"
