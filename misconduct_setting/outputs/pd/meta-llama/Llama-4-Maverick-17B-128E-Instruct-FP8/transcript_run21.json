The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In research, it's common to adjust the inclusion criteria or exclude participants based on certain conditions such as data quality issues, failure to meet predefined inclusion criteria, or outliers that significantly affect the results. These adjustments can happen as the researcher inspects the data and refines the analysis plan.\n\nFor example, participants might be excluded if they didn't follow instructions correctly, if there were technical issues during data collection, or if their data contained outliers that could skew the results. Excluding participants based on predefined criteria, applied equally to all participants and transparently reported, is a standard practice in research to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings.\n\nThe fact that an earlier version of the analysis script included more participants who were later excluded doesn't necessarily indicate misconduct. It could indicate a normal part of the research process where initial broad inclusion is later refined based on emerging understanding of the data or application of exclusion criteria that were decided upon before analyzing the data.\n\nMoreover, the recovery of an earlier version of the analysis script that included more participants can actually be seen as a positive aspect of transparency and accountability in research practices, especially if the changes are documented and justified.\n\nTherefore, given that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that an earlier analysis script including more participants had certain participants excluded in the final dataset due to legitimate reasons.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

In cases of misconduct, researchers might manipulate the dataset to achieve desired results, which could involve selectively excluding participants to influence the outcome of the analysis.\n\nHowever, the act of excluding participants is not in itself indicative of misconduct; it's how and why participants were excluded that matters. If Lena committed misconduct, she might have excluded participants in a way that wasn't transparent, consistent, or based on predefined criteria, potentially to enhance the statistical significance or to make the results more aligned with the theory being tested.\n\nThe existence of an earlier analysis script with more participants could be used to fabricate a narrative of initial broad inclusion followed by legitimate exclusions. Alternatively, it could be a genuine remnant of an initial analysis that was later manipulated.\n\nThus, the likelihood of an earlier analysis including more participants who were later excluded, given that Lena committed academic misconduct, depends on the nature of the misconduct. If the misconduct involved manipulating the dataset, then it's possible that participants were excluded in a way that was not transparent or justified.\n\nGiven the scenario, it is still fairly likely that there would be evidence of earlier analyses or different participant inclusions due to either genuine changes in analysis plans or attempts to manipulate the data.\n\nProbability judgment: 70"

However, when there is a real effect, it's expected that more p-values will be below .05, but they should still be somewhat randomly distributed around the significant values.\n\nThe phenomenon described, where there's a high concentration of p-values just below .05 and a scarcity just above, is sometimes referred to as \"p-hacking\" or \"significance hacking\" when it's due to researcher manipulation. However, even without misconduct, various factors can lead to a non-uniform distribution of p-values.\n\nThat being said, it's not impossible for a genuine dataset to exhibit a somewhat unusual distribution of p-values due to the specific characteristics of the data or the analyses performed. However, an unusually high concentration just below .05 without corresponding values just above is suspicious and not typically expected under normal circumstances.\n\nResearchers often report a mix of significant and non-significant findings, and the distribution of p-values can be influenced by many factors including the effect size, sample size, and research practices. A perfectly clean distribution around the significance threshold is not usually observed in genuine research due to the inherent variability in data.\n\nGiven that the described pattern is somewhat suspicious and not typically expected in genuine research without any manipulation, if Lena did not commit misconduct, it's still possible but less likely to observe such a distribution.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

This pattern is a common indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting, where researchers might manipulate the data or analysis to achieve statistically significant results.\n\nWhen researchers engage in misconduct such as data manipulation or selective exclusion/inclusion of data points, they often aim to achieve significant results. A straightforward way to do this is by adjusting the analysis until the p-value drops below the .05 threshold, which can result in a clustering of p-values just below .05.\n\nThis behavior is sometimes referred to as \"p-hacking\" and can involve various tactics such as selectively excluding outliers, trying different analysis methods until one yields a significant result, or stopping data collection when the results become significant.\n\nThe described distribution of p-values is consistent with such practices.
