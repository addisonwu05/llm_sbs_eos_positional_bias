The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The emails in question reveal a high level of pressure and stakes associated with the study's outcome. Lena mentions that her supervisor is counting on the study to save the grant and that a null result would negatively impact her career prospects, specifically her chances at a postdoc.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies that she did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data. The pressure she felt, as expressed in the emails, could still be genuine. Researchers often face significant pressure to produce publishable results, especially when their career advancement is tied to such outcomes. The stakes can be high, with implications for funding, career progression, and the reputation of the research group.\n\nLena's emails reflect an awareness of these stakes and her personal investment in the study's success. The fact that she expresses a need for the study to \"work\" could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean she is under pressure to produce a valid, publishable result, not necessarily a falsified one. Researchers often have a strong desire for their hypotheses to be supported by data because it validates their theoretical contributions and the effort they put into designing and executing the study.\n\nGiven the context, it's plausible that Lena, even if she did not commit academic misconduct, would feel the pressure and express it in a personal email. Her statement doesn't directly imply an intention to falsify data but rather reflects her anxiety about meeting the expectations tied to the study.\n\nTherefore, considering the pressures and stakes involved in academic research, it is reasonable to believe that Lena could write such emails even if she hadn't committed misconduct. The language used suggests stress and a desire for success but doesn't directly indicate an intent to manipulate data.\n\nThe likelihood that Lena would write such emails if she did not commit academic misconduct is relatively high because it reflects genuine pressures and concerns common in academic research environments.\n\n90"

If Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is likely that this pressure contributed to her actions. Writing emails that express this pressure could be seen as a candid reflection of her situation, regardless of whether she ultimately decided to falsify or manipulate data.\n\nHowever, one might argue that if Lena had committed academic misconduct, she might be less likely to openly discuss her pressures and the stakes involved, as this could potentially incriminate her or raise suspicions about her integrity. On the other hand, it's also possible that she might not see these emails as potentially incriminating or might not be cautious about expressing her true feelings in a personal communication.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the content of the emails could be interpreted as evidence of motive. The fact that she felt such strong pressure and expressed it in writing doesn't necessarily mean she would avoid discussing it, even if she had taken steps to manipulate the data.\n\nTherefore, the act of writing these emails doesn't directly correlate with or rule out academic misconduct.

The concentration of p-values just below .05 can occur naturally, but an unusually high concentration with a sharp drop-off just above .05 is not typical under standard statistical practices without any form of selection or manipulation.\n\nThere are several potential explanations for this pattern that do not involve misconduct, such as the actual effect sizes being large enough that the study was well-powered to detect them, or that the analyses were planned a priori without flexibility that could lead to p-hacking.
