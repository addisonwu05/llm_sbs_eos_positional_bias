The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given that the preregistration document was modified after data collection, we need to consider the purpose and standard practice surrounding preregistration in research.\n\nPreregistration is a process where researchers publicly document their study design, hypotheses, and analysis plan before collecting data. This is done to distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analyses, enhance transparency, and reduce the likelihood of false positives by avoiding practices like p-hacking or selectively reporting outcomes that yield significant results.\n\nModifying a preregistration document after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, deviates from the intended purpose of preregistration. Such changes could be seen as an attempt to make the study's hypotheses or analysis plan align with the results obtained, rather than the other way around.\n\nThere are, however, situations where changes to a preregistration might be justified and not indicative of misconduct. For instance, if unforeseen circumstances or errors in the initial planning become apparent during data collection or analysis, researchers might argue that changes were necessary for the integrity of the research.\n\nHowever, making such changes without clear documentation of the reasons, transparency about when and why changes were made, and ideally, doing so in a way that is transparent and justifiable (e.g., updating the preregistration with clear rationales for changes), can raise suspicions.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it implies that any modifications to the preregistration document were made in good faith and for legitimate reasons. While it's possible that unforeseen circumstances necessitated changes, the lack of a clear, transparent record of why such significant changes were made post-data collection complicates this interpretation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the modification of a preregistration document after data collection, particularly to alter exclusion criteria or primary outcomes, is not standard practice and is generally viewed with skepticism. The act itself, without additional context or justification, leans towards raising concerns about the researcher's integrity.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given this specific action (modifying the preregistration document after data collection) is relatively low, because such an action is not typically considered acceptable practice without a clear, justified reason that is transparently documented.\n\n10"

By altering the preregistration document to match the analyses that yielded the desired or significant results, Lena could potentially mask or justify the deviation from the original plan.\n\nIf Lena's intention was to fabricate or falsify data, or to selectively report results in a way that misrepresents the true findings, modifying the preregistration document to fit the manipulated data or analyses would be a plausible step to avoid detection.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that she would modify the preregistration document after data collection to change some exclusion criteria and primary outcomes as part of her efforts to conceal the misconduct or to make the study's results appear more coherent or significant.\n\n90"
