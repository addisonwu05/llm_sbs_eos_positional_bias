  "Based on the analysis of the evidence, I conclude that the probability of Lena committing academic misconduct is 40. While there are some red flags and suspicious circumstances, there are also plausible explanations and evidence supporting her integrity. Given this mixed picture, I do not have sufficient confidence to definitively state that she committed academic misconduct.\n\nNo."
