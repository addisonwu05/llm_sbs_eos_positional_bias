The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that an earlier analysis script included more participants who were later excluded from the final dataset. There are several legitimate reasons why this could happen in the course of research.\n\n1. **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: Initially, the criteria for including participants in the analysis might not have been as refined or strictly applied. Later, upon further review or as a result of reviewer comments, the criteria might have been tightened, leading to the exclusion of some participants who did not meet the revised criteria.\n\n2. **Data Quality Issues**: It's common for researchers to inspect their data for quality issues such as outliers, missing values, or evidence of non-compliance with the study protocol. Participants with significant data quality issues might be excluded from the final analysis to ensure the integrity and reliability of the results.\n\n3. **Reviewer Comments**: The peer review process often leads to requests for additional analyses or changes in the analysis plan. This could result in excluding certain participants based on feedback from reviewers, which is a legitimate part of the scientific process.\n\n4. **Pre-registration vs. Exploratory Analyses**: If the study was pre-registered, the original analysis plan might have specified certain inclusion criteria or analyses that were later adjusted based on data inspection or reviewer feedback. Adjustments to the analysis plan, including excluding participants, can be legitimate as long as they are transparently reported.\n\n5. **Data Cleaning and Screening**: Researchers often perform data cleaning and screening to identify and potentially exclude participants with data that are not usable or that indicate non-compliance with study instructions.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's reasonable to expect that an earlier version of an analysis script might include more participants who were later excluded as part of the normal process of refining the analysis based on data quality, reviewer feedback, or adherence to the study protocol.\n\nTherefore, finding an earlier analysis script that includes more participants than the final dataset is not, by itself, strong evidence of misconduct. It could be part of a legitimate process of data refinement and analysis adjustment.\n\n90"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, such as fabricating or falsifying data, it is still possible that an earlier analysis script included more participants who were later excluded from the final dataset. A researcher engaging in misconduct might initially fabricate or falsify data for a larger group of participants but later adjust the dataset to exclude certain participants to better align with the desired outcomes or to make the data appear more \"reasonable\" or less suspicious.\n\nHowever, a person committing misconduct might also be expected to fabricate data in a way that directly supports their hypothesis without leaving a trail of earlier, different analyses. The presence of an earlier analysis with more participants could suggest either that the researcher was refining their analysis or that they were adjusting their fabrication.\n\nYet, it's also plausible that a researcher fabricating data might create an initial dataset and then adjust it, potentially excluding participants (fabricated or real) to fine-tune the results. The practice of excluding participants could be used to achieve the desired statistical significance or to remove \"outliers\" that don't fit the expected pattern, even if it involves fabricated data.\n\nThus, while the presence of an earlier analysis script with more participants might initially seem suspicious, it is still consistent with a range of behaviors, including misconduct where the perpetrator adjusts their fabricated dataset.\n\nThe likelihood that an earlier analysis script includes more participants when misconduct has occurred is plausible because it reflects potential adjustments in the dataset to achieve desired results.\n\n80"

However, there are several factors and potential explanations to consider.\n\n1. **Publication Bias and Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: While publication bias typically refers to the tendency to publish studies with significant results over those without, researchers' practices can influence the distribution of p-values. However, this doesn't directly explain an unusual concentration just below .05 without considering selective reporting or p-hacking.\n\n2. **P-hacking vs. Legitimate Analysis**: P-hacking refers to the manipulation of data or analyses to achieve a significant result (p < .05). An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 can be a sign of p-hacking. However, the question stipulates that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, implying that any such practices would be unintentional or not considered misconduct.\n\n3. **Distribution of P-values Under the Alternative Hypothesis**: If the alternative hypothesis is true, and there is a real effect, we might expect to see a higher concentration of significant p-values. However, the distribution of p-values under the alternative hypothesis can vary widely depending on factors like the true effect size and sample size.\n\n4. **Rounding or Reporting Practices**: Sometimes, the way p-values are reported or rounded can affect their distribution. However, this doesn't typically cause a clustering just below .05.\n\n5. **Genuine Patterns**: In some cases, if the theory being tested is correct and the effect sizes are substantial, one might see a number of significant results. However, the clustering just below .05 is still somewhat unusual and could raise eyebrows.\n\nGiven that we're considering a scenario where Lena did not commit academic misconduct, and assuming that the research was conducted with integrity, the observed pattern is still somewhat unexpected. It could happen due to a combination of factors such as the true effects being tested, the sample size, and the specific analyses conducted.\n\nHowever, without direct evidence of p-hacking or other forms of misconduct, and given that we're working under the assumption of no misconduct, we need to consider the possibility that the observed distribution could occur naturally or due to the specifics of the research design.\n\nThe probability that this occurs naturally under conditions of no misconduct, while not high, is still plausible due to various factors like the specifics of the data and the analyses performed.\n\n20"

This pattern is often cited as a potential indicator of p-hacking or other forms of statistical manipulation, as it suggests that analyses or data were adjusted until they yielded a statistically significant result.\n\nP-hacking involves selectively reporting or analyzing data until a significant p-value is obtained. A common strategy in p-hacking is to continue adjusting the analysis (e.g., by excluding certain data points, trying different statistical tests, or including/excluding covariates) until the p-value drops below .05. This can result in a distribution of p-values that is not what one would expect under normal circumstances, with an unusual concentration just below the .05 threshold.\n\nIf Lena engaged in such practices, either by manipulating the data directly or by selectively analyzing the data until significant results were found, we would expect to see patterns in the p-values that reflect this manipulation. An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 is a red flag for such behavior.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that the final dataset would exhibit this characteristic.\n\n80"
