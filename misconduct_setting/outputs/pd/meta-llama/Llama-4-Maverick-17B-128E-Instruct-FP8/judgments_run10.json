  "Based on the available evidence and the assessments made, I do not have conclusive evidence to definitively state that Lena committed academic misconduct. While there are some red flags, such as the suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, there are also indicators that suggest she has a history of good research practices. Therefore, my judgment is: No."
