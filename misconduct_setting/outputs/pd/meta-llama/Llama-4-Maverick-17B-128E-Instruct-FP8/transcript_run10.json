The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of observing an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 and very few just above .05 if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider what factors could lead to such a distribution of p-values.\n\n1. **Understanding p-values**: p-values represent the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. A p-value just below .05 is often considered statistically significant, as it is below the commonly used threshold of .05 for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n2. **Distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis**: When the null hypothesis is true, p-values are expected to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. This means that, theoretically, we would expect an equal number of p-values to fall into any given interval of the same width between 0 and 1.\n\n3. **Observed distribution**: The observed distribution shows a high concentration of p-values just below .05 and almost none just above .05. This pattern is not expected under the null hypothesis for a set of independent tests.\n\n4. **Possible explanations for the observed distribution**:\n    - **Manipulation or selective reporting**: One explanation is that the data or the analyses were manipulated to achieve significance, or that non-significant results were selectively not reported. However, we're considering the scenario where Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n    - **Honest analysis practices with some bias towards significant results**: Researchers might, without misconduct, conduct multiple analyses and choose to report those that are significant, a practice known as p-hacking when done in a way that exploits the flexibility in data analysis. However, the described pattern is quite extreme.\n    - **Real effects and genuine research practices**: If the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., there are real effects), p-values are expected to be lower. However, the specific pattern of p-values just below .05 without those just above .05 is unusual.\n\n5. **The role of chance and variability**: Even with honest practices, some datasets may by chance show an unusual distribution of p-values. However, a dataset showing a high concentration just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically unusual.\n\nGiven that the observed pattern is quite unusual and not what one would typically expect from genuine research findings without any form of bias or manipulation, we need to assess the likelihood of such a pattern occurring by chance or due to legitimate practices.\n\n**Assessment**:\nThe described pattern is indicative of potential p-hacking or selective reporting, but we're tasked with evaluating the likelihood under the assumption that Lena did not commit misconduct. While it's not impossible for genuine data to sometimes show unusual patterns, the specific distribution mentioned is suspicious and not typical.\n\nThe probability that the observed distribution occurs without misconduct is low because it suggests a level of 'rounding off' or 'tuning' that is hard to achieve through legitimate means alone, especially in a way that so sharply demarcates the .05 threshold.\n\nProbability judgment: 10"

If a researcher intentionally manipulates data or analyses, they may aim to achieve p-values below the .05 threshold.\n\n2. **Pattern consistent with misconduct**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, with very few just above, is a pattern that could result from such manipulation. For example, a researcher might selectively report or adjust analyses until they achieve significance.\n\n3. **Flexibility in analysis and reporting**: Researchers have various degrees of freedom in their analyses, such as choosing which analyses to run, how to handle outliers, and which results to report. Misconduct could involve exploiting these freedoms to achieve desired outcomes, like significant p-values.\n\n4. **Expected outcome of misconduct**: If Lena committed misconduct with the goal of achieving statistically significant results, it is plausible that she would end up with a dataset showing a suspiciously high number of p-values just below .05. This is because the manipulation could be aimed at crossing the .05 threshold.\n\n5. **Likelihood assessment**: The described pattern is consistent with what might be expected if a researcher manipulated their data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results. The concentration of p-values just below .05 is a red flag that could indicate such practices.\n\nGiven the above considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that the final dataset would show the described pattern.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

It is intended to enhance transparency and reduce the risk of researcher degrees of freedom being exploited to achieve desirable results.\n\n2. **Modifying preregistration documents**: While preregistration is meant to be a fixed record, there could be legitimate reasons for modifying a preregistration document. For example, unforeseen methodological issues might arise during data collection, or there might be a genuine need to adjust the analysis plan based on new information or unexpected data characteristics.\n\n3. **Innocent explanations for post-data collection modifications**: If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, potential innocent explanations for modifying the preregistration document after data collection could include honest mistakes or miscommunication. For instance, she might have forgotten that data collection was already completed, or there might have been an oversight in updating the document's timestamp.\n\nHowever, modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change key aspects such as exclusion criteria or primary outcomes raises significant concerns. Preregistration is valued for its ability to distinguish between planned and post-hoc analyses. Changing these details after seeing the data can undermine this distinction and is generally considered questionable practice.\n\n4. **Likelihood assessment**: While it's possible that Lena might have had a legitimate reason for modifying the preregistration document that was not related to misconduct (e.g., an honest mistake or a misunderstanding about the status of data collection), the fact that changes were made after data collection to elements as critical as exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly suspicious.\n\nGiven the potential for innocent explanations, but also considering the suspicious nature of the action, the likelihood is not extremely high but still plausible due to potential human error or procedural oversights.\n\nProbability judgment: 20"

Modifying a preregistration document to align with findings obtained after data collection could be a way to retroactively justify analyses that were not originally planned.\n\n2. **Modifying preregistration to conceal p-hacking or other misconduct**: If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration document after data collection to reflect the analyses that were actually performed (and perhaps adjusted to yield significant results) would be a way to make her actions appear more legitimate. This could involve changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes to match the analyses that yielded the most favorable results.\n\n3. **Likelihood of document modification in misconduct**: Given that modifying the preregistration document after data collection can help conceal the fact that analyses were chosen based on the data (a form of p-hacking), it is a plausible action for someone committing misconduct. It allows the researcher to present post-hoc analyses as if they were pre-planned, thus potentially misleading readers about the research process.\n\n4. **Assessment**: If Lena committed academic misconduct, it is reasonable to expect that she might modify the preregistration document to cover her tracks or to make her results appear more legitimate. This action aligns with the broader pattern of behavior associated with misconduct, such as manipulating data or analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nGiven the above considerations, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that she would modify the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes to better align with her actual analyses and findings.\n\nProbability judgment: 90"

This is entirely consistent with a scenario where she did not commit academic misconduct.\n\nThe scenario is plausible and aligns with good research practices, indicating that Lena's actions, as reflected in the data management logs, are likely a part of her legitimate research activities.\n\nProbability judgment: 95"

However, running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria can be a legitimate practice aimed at exploring the robustness of findings.\n\n2. **Pattern consistent with lab practices**: The fact that other students in the lab also ran multiple analysis scripts suggests that this is a common practice within the lab. If Lena committed misconduct, the presence of multiple scripts could either be part of her legitimate research or potentially used to mask selective reporting.\n\n3. **Distinguishing between legitimate practice and misconduct**: The key distinction lies in whether the multiple scripts were used to explore robustness in a transparent manner or to selectively report favorable results. The logs showing multiple scripts do not directly indicate misconduct; they could be part of a legitimate research process.\n\n4. **Likelihood assessment**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's still plausible that she would run and store multiple analysis scripts, as this is a practice encouraged within her lab. The existence of these scripts does not directly imply misconduct, and it's possible that she engaged in this practice as part of her research, regardless of any misconduct.\n\nThe behavior observed is consistent with the lab's culture and practices, and it is plausible that Lena would engage in it, regardless of any potential misconduct.\n\nProbability judgment: 80"

(Evidence suggesting low likelihood of misconduct)\n\nWhile there are some red flags, such as the suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection, there are also several indicators that suggest Lena is capable of and has a history of good research practices. The evidence is mixed and does not conclusively prove misconduct.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, it seems that while there are concerns, they are not conclusive. The probability that Lena committed academic misconduct is not negligible but is also not certain.\n\nProbability judgment: 40"
