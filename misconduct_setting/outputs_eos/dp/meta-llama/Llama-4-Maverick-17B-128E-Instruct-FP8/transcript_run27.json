    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's consider each piece of information and its implications.\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena ran and stored multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide effort to explore robustness suggests a legitimate research practice. This behavior is consistent with good research methodology and is not indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants**: The exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes in the raw data files that predated the journal submission is a standard practice if the exclusion criteria were predetermined and not influenced by the results. This action is justifiable and transparent.\n\n3. **Lab switched software and experienced a hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software and the loss of files due to a hard drive failure are plausible events that can happen in any research setting. The confirmation of a hardware failure by the IT department supports the authenticity of Lena's claim.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: Lena's history of well-documented and reproducible data in previous studies, which passed an independent audit, supports her credibility and suggests that she is capable of handling data appropriately.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have run multiple analysis scripts as part of exploring robustness, a practice consistent with good research practices and observed in other students.\n- Participants would be excluded based on valid, pre-defined criteria that were documented before the submission.\n- The lab would experience a software switch and a hardware failure, events that, while unfortunate, are not uncommon in research environments.\n- She would have a clean record from previous studies, indicating a history of proper data handling.\n\nTherefore, the scenario described is quite likely if Lena did not commit misconduct, as it aligns with expected practices and events in a research setting.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's consider the implications of each piece of information.\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, running multiple scripts could be a strategy to find favorable results, but it could also be a genuine attempt to test robustness. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this might be a lab practice, making it less indicative of misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants**: Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes is a standard practice. If Lena committed misconduct, she might have fabricated or manipulated these notes. However, the fact that the notes predate the journal submission complicates this, as it suggests the exclusions were decided before the results were known.\n\n3. **Lab switched software and experienced a hard drive failure**: These are events that can happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still experience hardware failures or software changes.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she had been careful or lucky enough in her previous studies to avoid detection or not felt the need to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, the events described could occur regardless of whether Lena committed misconduct or not. However, some aspects like having a prior clean record and the specific reasons for participant exclusion might be less expected if she had committed misconduct, as it suggests a level of transparency and adherence to good practices. Nonetheless, it's entirely possible for someone committing misconduct in one instance to have been clean in the past.\n\nThe presence of multiple analysis scripts and the software switch along with the hard drive failure are not directly related to whether or not she committed misconduct. The prior clean record and the exclusion based on pre-existing notes could be seen as less likely if she was inclined towards misconduct, but not implausibly so.\n\n20"

    "content": "Let's assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is suspicious and could indicate p-hacking or selective reporting, which is a form of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it's less likely to observe such a pattern by chance, as it suggests manipulation of the data or analyses to achieve significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to prevent exactly this kind of issue by locking in the analysis plan before seeing the data. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, is highly suspicious and indicative of potential misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in analysis plans or exclusion criteria based on data quality or other valid reasons. However, if the changes were made without a clear, justifiable reason related to the research question or data quality, it could be seen as suspicious.\n\n4. **Lena's emails expressing pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While these emails indicate that Lena felt pressure and had a personal interest in the study's outcome, they do not directly imply misconduct. Researchers often have stakes in their research, and expressing this does not necessarily mean they will engage in misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is unlikely without some form of manipulation or selective reporting.\n- Modifying the preregistration document after data collection is highly unlikely without misconduct, as it contradicts the purpose of preregistration.\n- Having an earlier analysis script with additional participants could happen for various reasons, not all of which imply misconduct.\n- Expressing pressure and personal stakes in emails is plausible and does not directly imply misconduct.\n\nConsidering these factors, the combination of these events is quite unlikely if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, particularly due to the suspicious pattern of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document.\n\n5"
