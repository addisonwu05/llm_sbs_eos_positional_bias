    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to evaluate the probability of each piece of evidence occurring under the assumption that she is innocent and then consider how these probabilities combine.\n\n1. **Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is consistent with good research practice, especially given the lab-wide push to explore robustness. It's plausible that she, like other students, explored different analysis paths. Likelihood: High\n\n2. **The lab switched statistical software and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate events that can happen in the course of research. The switch in software could be due to various reasons such as updates in methodology, availability of new tools, or lab-wide policy changes. A hard drive failure is a known risk in data management. Likelihood: Moderate to High (as these are not uncommon events)\n\n3. **Two participants were excluded based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. If the notes predate the journal submission, it suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome was known, which is appropriate. Likelihood: High\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This suggests that Lena is generally diligent with her data handling. Likelihood: High, given that she has been audited and found to have good practices.\n\nCombining these observations:\n- The actions described are largely consistent with good research practices or are explicable by common issues encountered in research (software change, hardware failure).\n- The fact that Lena has a clean record and that some of the 'suspicious' behaviors are common in the lab (running multiple analysis scripts) supports the notion that she did not commit misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that these events would occur if Lena did not commit academic misconduct seems relatively high because they are either consistent with good practice or are events that can reasonably occur in the course of research without implying misconduct.\n\n85"

However, storing multiple scripts could also be a genuine attempt to test robustness. A researcher committing misconduct might still do this to cover their tracks or as part of their manipulation process. Likelihood: Moderate\n\n2. **The lab switched statistical software and Lena's laptop suffered a hard drive failure**: These events are unrelated to Lena's actions directly. A researcher committing misconduct might benefit from a hard drive failure if it helped conceal manipulated data or analyses, but the occurrence of such events is largely outside of her control. Likelihood: Moderate (as these are events that can happen regardless of misconduct)\n\n3. **Two participants were excluded based on pre-existing notes**: If Lena committed misconduct, she might fabricate or alter data, including creating false notes to justify excluding participants. However, the fact that the notes predate the journal submission could indicate genuine exclusion criteria. A sophisticated misconduct might involve backdating or fabricating such notes, but it's also possible that genuine notes were made. Likelihood: Moderate to Low (because it requires either genuine behavior or sophisticated fabrication)\n\n4. **Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A researcher who commits misconduct might have a clean record beforehand if they were careful to hide their actions until then. It's not uncommon for individuals to have a history of good behavior before being caught for misconduct. Likelihood: Moderate\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed misconduct, the described events could still occur for various reasons, some of which might be part of her attempt to cover her tracks or appear diligent, while others are simply coincidental.\n\nThe combination of these factors doesn't strongly contradict the hypothesis of misconduct but also doesn't strongly support it due to the mixed nature of the evidence. The likelihood is not extremely low because some of these events can be seen as either unrelated to misconduct or potentially part of a strategy to commit and conceal it.\n\n40"

Likelihood: Low\n\n2. **Preregistration document modified after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to prevent exactly this kind of post-hoc adjustment. Modifying it after data collection is a significant red flag for potential misconduct.

Likelihood: Low\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script included additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that participants were excluded for legitimate or illegitimate reasons. If Lena did not commit misconduct, changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria might be due to genuine reasons (e.g., new information about participants). However, the fact that an earlier version existed and was changed could raise suspicions. Likelihood: Moderate\n\n4. **Emails expressing pressure and the need for the study to \"work\"**: These emails indicate that Lena felt pressure, which could be a motive for misconduct. However, feeling pressure doesn't necessarily lead to misconduct. Many researchers face similar pressures without compromising their integrity. Likelihood: Moderate to High (as it's plausible for researchers to feel such pressures)\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the probability of all these events occurring together is low because some of them are strongly indicative of questionable research practices or misconduct.\n\nThe combination of an unusually clean distribution of p-values, modification of the preregistration document after data collection, and changes in participant inclusion/exclusion alongside expressed pressure, makes the scenario unlikely under the assumption of no misconduct.\n\n10"
