    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the probability of each piece of evidence occurring under the assumption that she is innocent, and then assess how these probabilities collectively bear on the question.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is consistent with good research practice, especially given the context of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Labs often encourage such practices to ensure the robustness of their findings across different analytical approaches. The fact that other students show similar patterns supports that this is a common practice in the lab. Thus, this is likely under the assumption of innocence.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable and standard practice in research to ensure data quality. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome of the study was known, which is consistent with proper research practice. This is likely under the assumption of innocence.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Labs often update or change their software tools for various reasons, including better functionality or compatibility. Hardware failures are also common and can happen to anyone. The confirmation by the IT department adds credibility to the claim that a hardware failure occurred. Thus, these events are possible and not necessarily indicative of misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Having a history of well-documented and reproducible data that passes an independent audit is a strong indicator of good research practice. It suggests that Lena is capable of handling data properly and that any irregularities in the current study are not part of a larger pattern of misconduct. This history supports her innocence.\n\nConsidering these points, the scenario described is plausible under the assumption that Lena did not commit academic misconduct. Each of the elements described can be explained by factors unrelated to intentional fraud or misconduct, and they are consistent with good or at least acceptable research practices, or simply unfortunate events.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, we need to consider whether the evidence is consistent with or expected under the assumption of guilt.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: While this could be a genuine attempt to check robustness, it could also be used to retrospectively justify data manipulation by trying out different analyses until one yields the desired result. However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this might be standard lab practice rather than an attempt to hide misconduct.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes that predate the journal submission**: This could be seen as a genuine practice to ensure data quality, but a researcher committing misconduct might also fabricate or alter records to make their exclusion criteria seem pre-determined and thus legitimate. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission could be genuine or fabricated.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. However, a researcher committing misconduct might potentially use such events as a convenient explanation for discrepancies or missing data.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A person committing misconduct in one study might still have a history of good practice, as misconduct can be an exception rather than the rule. However, it might be less likely for someone with a history of careful data handling to suddenly engage in misconduct, though it's not impossible.\n\nThe evidence described doesn't strongly support or contradict the hypothesis of misconduct directly. However, the presence of alternative explanations for the observations (e.g., genuine research practice, unfortunate events) makes it somewhat plausible that these events could occur even if Lena committed misconduct, as they don't directly imply innocence or guilt.\n\n20"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we should consider each piece of evidence in the context of innocence.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a red flag for potential p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that are considered academic misconduct. The absence of p-values just above .05 is suspicious and suggests manipulation to achieve statistical significance. This is unlikely under the assumption of innocence.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and prevent post-hoc adjustments to analyses. Modifying it after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes without a valid reason (like correcting an error) is a form of academic misconduct. This action is not consistent with innocence.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to legitimate reasons such as applying exclusion criteria. However, if the exclusion criteria were decided post-hoc and were not properly justified or preregistered, this could be suspicious. The fact that an earlier version of the script included more participants could indicate that some were excluded based on criteria decided after seeing the data, which could be misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails suggest that Lena had a strong motivation to achieve certain results, they do not directly imply misconduct. Researchers often have personal stakes in their work, and expressing this to a friend is not unusual. However, the intensity of the motivation (\"I need this one to work\") could potentially lead to questionable decisions.\n\nConsidering these points, the scenario described is quite unlikely under the assumption of innocence, especially due to the suspicious statistical results and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection. These actions directly suggest potential academic misconduct.\n\n5"
