    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's break down the components and analyze them in the context of her innocence.\n\n1. **Lena's prior record**: Having a previously strong record of careful data handling and her earlier projects passing an independent data audit suggests that she is meticulous and adheres to good research practices. This background supports the notion that she is likely to continue this behavior in subsequent studies.\n\n2. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena, like other students, explored different analysis scripts as part of a lab-wide initiative to check robustness, indicates a transparent and systematic approach to data analysis. This practice is considered good research methodology and is in line with not committing misconduct.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the results were known or submitted for publication. This is a standard and justifiable practice in research to ensure data quality.\n\n4. **Lab software switch and laptop hard drive failure**: The lab switching software mid-project and Lena experiencing a hard drive failure are unfortunate coincidences that can happen in any research setting. These events can lead to complications in data management and analysis but are not indicative of misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is plausible that:\n- She would continue her past behavior of maintaining clean and well-documented data.\n- She would follow lab practices, such as exploring alternative analysis scripts.\n- She would have valid reasons for excluding certain participants, documented before the submission.\n- Unforeseen technical issues like a software switch and hardware failure could occur.\n\nAll these factors together suggest that if Lena is innocent, it is quite likely that these conditions would be met because they either reflect good research practice or are the result of circumstances beyond her control.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's consider the elements presented.\n\n1. **Multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she might still run multiple scripts to create an appearance of exploring different analyses, making her eventual choice seem more justified. However, this could also be a genuine practice.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants with predating notes**: If Lena committed misconduct, fabricating or altering data/notes to justify exclusions is possible. However, the fact that notes predate the journal submission could indicate either genuine documentation or careful falsification.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events that can happen regardless of Lena's actions. A researcher committing misconduct might not be deterred or directly affected by these events, but they could potentially complicate the investigation.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: A person committing misconduct in one study might have a clean record in previous studies. Misconduct can be a one-time event, and previous good behavior does not preclude future wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of these events happening is still relatively plausible because:\n- Running multiple scripts and excluding participants based on pre-existing notes could be part of either genuine research practice or a facade to hide misconduct.\n- The lab software switch and hardware failure are coincidental and not directly related to her actions.\n- Having a prior clean record is consistent with the idea that misconduct can occur at any time, even in individuals with previously good track records.\n\nHowever, the combination of these factors, especially the transparent and justifiable practices like running multiple analysis scripts and documenting participant exclusions before submission, might be less likely if she was trying to hide misconduct, as one might expect more evidence of tampering or less transparency.\n\n20"

Modifying it after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a red flag for academic misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be seen as suspicious if the exclusion of these participants was not justified or was done to alter the results. However, it could also be part of a legitimate process of data cleaning and participant exclusion based on predefined criteria.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: While these emails show that Lena felt pressure and had a personal stake in the study's success, they do not directly imply misconduct. Researchers often feel pressure to produce significant results, but this does not necessarily lead to misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is still possible, though less likely, for some of these conditions to be met due to other factors (e.g., genuine data issues leading to participant exclusion). However, the combination of a suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection are particularly indicative of potential misconduct.\n\nThe presence of these red flags together makes it less plausible that Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\n5"
