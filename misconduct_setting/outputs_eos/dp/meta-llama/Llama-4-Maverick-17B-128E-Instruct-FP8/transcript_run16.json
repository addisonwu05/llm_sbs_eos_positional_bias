    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is in line with the lab-wide push to explore robustness and is also seen in other students' practices. It's a good research practice to test the robustness of findings by using different analysis approaches. This action is consistent with honest and transparent research behavior.\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on pre-existing notes in the raw data files**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable and common practice in research to ensure data quality. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the outcome of the study was known or before any potential pressure to manipulate results.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Changes in software and hardware issues are not uncommon in research projects, especially those that span several years or involve multiple collaborators. These events can lead to file management issues and loss of some data or files. The confirmation by the IT department of a hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Passing an independent data audit and having \"well-documented and reproducible\" raw data and scripts in earlier projects indicate a history of good research practice. This history makes it more plausible that any irregularities in the current study are due to unintentional errors rather than misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, the described scenario is quite plausible if Lena did not commit academic misconduct. The behaviors and events described are consistent with good research practices, unfortunate but not uncommon technical issues, and a history of diligence in data management.\n\n80"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she ran multiple scripts to find a desirable outcome. However, the fact that this behavior is similar to other students and part of a lab-wide practice to explore robustness complicates this interpretation. It could be seen as either a genuine attempt to test robustness or as a way to \"fish\" for significant results. The latter could be consistent with misconduct, but it's not conclusive evidence.\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on pre-existing notes**: If Lena committed misconduct, it might be expected that she would fabricate reasons for excluding participants. However, the fact that the notes predate the journal submission complicates this, as it suggests the decision to exclude was made before the outcome was known. This could be seen as less likely if she were fabricating data or manipulating exclusions post-hoc.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still experience technical issues. However, one might argue that someone committing misconduct could potentially manipulate or fabricate explanations for lost files or changes in software.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Individuals who commit misconduct might have a history of doing so, but it's also possible for someone to start misconduct later in their career. A prior clean record does not necessarily preclude later misconduct.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it seems somewhat coincidental or potentially convenient that:\n- She had a plausible reason for running multiple analysis scripts (consistent with lab practices).\n- The reasons for excluding participants predated the journal submission.\n- Technical issues (software switch and hard drive failure) occurred, which could be seen as complicating or covering her actions.\n- She had a previously clean record.\n\nHowever, none of these directly prove or disprove misconduct. The presence of multiple analysis scripts and a prior clean record might be seen as slightly less likely if she committed misconduct, as one might expect more direct evidence of manipulation or a less transparent history.\n\nThe scenario is possible but slightly less likely under the assumption of misconduct due to the combination of factors that either suggest innocence or are neutral. However, it's still plausible that someone committing misconduct could have a prior clean record and experience technical issues.\n\n40"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze each piece of information:\n\n1. **P-values just below .05**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above could suggest p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be less likely to observe such a distribution by chance, as one would expect a more uniform distribution around .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to increase transparency by specifying analysis plans before seeing the data. Modifying it after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes without a valid reason could indicate an attempt to make the results look more significant or favorable. If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be unusual to modify the preregistration in such a manner without a clear, legitimate reason.\n\n3. **Exclusion of participants in the final dataset**: The exclusion of participants from an earlier version of the analysis script could be legitimate if there were valid reasons for their exclusion (e.g., not meeting inclusion criteria, data quality issues). However, the fact that they were included initially and then excluded later could raise suspicions if not properly justified.\n\n4. **Lena's emails expressing pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: These emails indicate that Lena felt pressure to produce a certain outcome, both from her supervisor's expectations and her own career prospects. While feeling pressure doesn't necessarily imply misconduct, it can be a risk factor.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct:\n- The distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection are suspicious and less likely under the assumption of no misconduct.\n- The exclusion of participants could be legitimate but needs justification.\n- The emails reveal pressure, which is a context that could potentially influence behavior.\n\nThe combination of these factors is somewhat unlikely if Lena did not commit misconduct, especially the suspicious distribution of p-values and the post-hoc modification of the preregistration.\n\n10"
