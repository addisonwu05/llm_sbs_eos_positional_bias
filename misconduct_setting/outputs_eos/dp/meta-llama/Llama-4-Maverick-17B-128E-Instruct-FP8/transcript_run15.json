    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider the various pieces of information provided and how they relate to her behavior and the circumstances surrounding the study in question.\n\n1. **Prior record of clean data handling**: Lena's earlier projects were audited and found to have well-documented and reproducible data and scripts. This suggests that she has a history of good research practices.\n\n2. **Lab's data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: The fact that Lena, like other students in the lab, ran and stored multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of exploring robustness, indicates a practice that is in line with good research methodology and the lab's culture. This behavior is expected and justified in the context of trying to understand the robustness of findings.\n\n3. **Exclusion of two participants**: The exclusion of participants based on notes that predate the journal submission and are related to the participants' self-reported issues (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) is a reasonable and transparent research practice. It indicates that decisions on participant exclusion were made before the submission and were based on legitimate criteria.\n\n4. **Lab software switch and laptop hard drive failure**: The switch in statistical software mid-project and the hard drive failure are external factors that could naturally lead to some irregularities or complications in data handling and analysis. These are plausible explanations for any inconsistencies or missing data.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the described events and findings are plausible and align with good or at least understandable research practices, given the context.\n\nThe described scenario includes a series of events and practices that are either neutral or positive in terms of research integrity (running multiple analyses for robustness, excluding participants based on pre-submission notes, having a history of good data handling practices). The lab's practices and external factors (software switch, hard drive failure) provide reasonable explanations for some of the observations that might initially seem suspicious.\n\n85"

However, the described behaviors and events are largely related to either standard research practices or external factors.\n\n1. **Running multiple analysis scripts**: This could be seen as either a genuine attempt to test the robustness of the findings or, if Lena was fabricating data, a way to create the appearance of having explored different analytical paths. However, committing misconduct doesn't directly imply that she would or wouldn't do this.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-submission notes**: If Lena was fabricating or manipulating data, it's plausible she might exclude participants in a way that supports her fabricated findings and document it in a way that appears legitimate. However, the fact that notes predate the journal submission could indicate either genuine practice or careful back-dating.\n\n3. **Lab software switch and hard drive failure**: These are external factors that aren't directly related to whether or not Lena committed misconduct. They could happen regardless of her actions.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: A history of good research practices could be used by someone committing misconduct to build a false sense of security or credibility.\n\nConsidering these points, the likelihood of these specific events occurring doesn't strongly correlate with whether or not Lena committed academic misconduct. Many of these factors are either unrelated to misconduct (like the software switch and hard drive failure) or could be consistent with either honest or dishonest behavior.\n\nThe described scenario, while not conclusive evidence against misconduct, doesn't strongly suggest it either. Someone committing misconduct might still follow some good practices to avoid detection or to make their actions seem more legitimate.\n\n20"

If Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be unusual to see such a distribution by chance alone, as one would expect a more uniform distribution around .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to be a record of the analysis plan before seeing the data. Modifying it after data collection, especially to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, undermines this purpose and can be seen as a sign of questionable research practices or worse.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate that decisions on participant exclusion were made post-hoc, which might be legitimate if based on pre-defined criteria but could also suggest p-hacking or data manipulation if those decisions were made based on the data.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails show that Lena had a personal and professional interest in the study's success, they don't directly imply misconduct. Researchers often have stakes in their work, but the presence of such stakes can sometimes correlate with the temptation to bend rules.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the combination of these factors is unlikely because:\n- The distribution of p-values is suspicious and not easily explained by innocent means.\n- The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is not in line with best practices and raises suspicions.\n- The change in included participants between analysis script versions could be legitimate but, combined with other factors, raises concerns.\n\nConsidering these points, the likelihood that all these events occurred without misconduct is low because several of the observed behaviors and outcomes are either directly indicative of questionable practices or are highly suspicious.\n\n5"
