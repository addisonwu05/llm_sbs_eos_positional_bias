    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood of the given scenario if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to assess the probability of each piece of evidence occurring under the assumption that she is innocent and then consider how these pieces collectively support or detract from that assumption.\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: This behavior is in line with best practices in research, especially given the lab-wide push to explore robustness. It's plausible and expected that Lena, like other students, would explore different analysis paths. This action is consistent with good research practice and does not directly imply misconduct.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes**: The exclusion of two participants due to reported issues (falling asleep or not understanding instructions) with notes predating the journal submission suggests that the decision to exclude these participants was made before the analysis was finalized or submitted for publication. This is a reasonable and transparent research practice, as it indicates that exclusions were based on predefined criteria or issues identified during data collection.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failing**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Labs often switch software or tools for various reasons, including updates in methodology or improvements in analysis capabilities. A hardware failure is a common risk in computing and can happen to anyone. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This history suggests that Lena is capable of handling data responsibly and following good research practices. It supports the notion that she is unlikely to suddenly engage in misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would have explored different analysis scripts as part of good research practice.\n- She would have excluded participants based on legitimate reasons documented before the analysis was finalized.\n- The lab might switch software, and she could experience a hardware failure.\n- She would have a clean record from previous audits, indicating a history of responsible data handling.\n\nAll these factors are consistent with the behavior of a researcher who is not committing misconduct but is instead following good research practices and facing typical challenges in research projects.\n\n85"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed evidence if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Running and storing multiple alternative analysis scripts**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she might still run multiple scripts to cover her tracks or to make her results appear more robust. However, the fact that she stored them could be seen as either an attempt to appear diligent or an actual practice of exploring different analyses. This behavior doesn't directly indicate guilt or innocence.\n\n2. **Excluding participants with notes predating journal submission**: If Lena was fabricating data or results, she might still exclude participants based on fabricated or real reasons to make her dataset appear cleaner. The fact that notes predate the journal submission could be part of fabricating a paper trail to appear legitimate.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that can happen regardless of Lena's integrity. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such events, and they could potentially use these as excuses for inconsistencies or missing data.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: A person committing misconduct might still have a clean record if this is their first instance of misconduct, or they might have been careful in previous studies. This does not strongly indicate either guilt or innocence in the current case.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the evidence presented doesn't strongly contradict this hypothesis, but some aspects (like having a prior clean record and the presence of notes predating the journal submission) could be seen as either consistent with misconduct (if she was careful or fabricating a trail) or innocence. However, the fact that she kept multiple analysis scripts and had legitimate reasons for excluding participants could be seen as less likely if she was trying to fabricate results, as one might expect a more straightforward falsification.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that these events would occur if Lena committed misconduct is not extremely low because many of these factors could be consistent with either scenario or are unrelated to her guilt.\n\n20"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the given evidence if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we need to consider each piece of information:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. However, it could also result from legitimate analysis practices, though it's less likely. The probability of this occurring by chance or due to other factors if Lena is innocent is low.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency. Modifying it after data collection could be a sign of trying to justify the analyses that were actually performed, potentially indicating misconduct. If Lena is innocent, it's still possible that changes were made for legitimate reasons, but transparency and good practice would typically involve clearly documenting such changes.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could indicate changes in analysis plans or data cleaning that are legitimate. However, it could also suggest that participants were selectively excluded to achieve desired results. If Lena is innocent, this could be due to a legitimate change in inclusion/exclusion criteria or data quality issues identified post-hoc.\n\n4. **Emails expressing pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: These emails indicate that Lena felt pressure to achieve certain results. While this pressure doesn't directly imply misconduct, it provides context. Researchers often feel pressure, but it doesn't necessarily lead to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, the combination of a suspicious pattern of p-values, changes to the preregistration document after data collection, and emails indicating a strong desire for positive results is concerning and could be seen as less likely under the assumption of innocence, primarily due to the suspicious pattern of p-values and the post-hoc changes to the preregistration.\n\n5"
