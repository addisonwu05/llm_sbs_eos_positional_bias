    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students - This is very common in legitimate research, especially when labs are encouraged to explore robustness. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this being normal practice.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with notes predating submission - This is standard research practice and the timing of the notes (before submission) supports legitimacy.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure - These are common, mundane technical issues that IT has independently verified.\n\n4. Prior clean record with data that passed independent audit - This establishes a baseline of trustworthy behavior and proper data handling practices.\n\nIf Lena is innocent, all of these pieces of evidence represent either normal research practices or unfortunate but common technical issues. The software switch and hard drive failure are independently verifiable facts. The exclusions follow standard protocols with proper documentation timing. The multiple analysis scripts align with lab-wide practices and good scientific exploration of robustness.\n\nThese observations would be highly expected in a scenario where no misconduct occurred - they represent the typical challenges and practices of legitimate research work.\n\n95"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students - If Lena committed misconduct, she might actually run MORE alternative analyses to find favorable results (p-hacking). The fact that other students show similar patterns could still occur as normal lab practice, providing cover for her misconduct.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with notes predating submission - If committing misconduct, Lena would likely be strategic about creating legitimate-looking documentation. Pre-dating notes or having some legitimate exclusions mixed with fraudulent data manipulation is plausible.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure - These are external, verifiable events that would occur regardless of Lena's conduct. Someone committing misconduct might even see these as convenient cover for any irregularities.\n\n4. Prior clean record with independent audit - Many cases of research misconduct involve people with previously good records who face new pressures. The current situation involves a high-stakes grant review and pressure from the supervisor, which could motivate someone to deviate from previously honest practices.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, most of these pieces of evidence could still reasonably occur - either as coincidental legitimate factors that provide cover, or as part of sophisticated misconduct that maintains plausible explanations. The technical issues are independent events, and the behavioral patterns could mask fraudulent activity.\n\n72"

While theoretically possible by chance, it's extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\n2. Preregistration modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes - This is a serious violation of research integrity principles. Even if done innocently, modifying preregistration after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\n3. Earlier analysis script with participants later excluded - While some legitimate exclusions can occur, combined with the other evidence, this suggests potential data manipulation to achieve desired results.\n\n4. Emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" - While researchers do face legitimate career pressures, the specific phrasing combined with the statistical irregularities is concerning.\n\nIf Lena is truly innocent, having ALL of these red flags appear together would be extraordinarily unlikely. The p-value distribution alone is a strong statistical indicator of manipulation. The post-hoc preregistration changes represent clear methodological problems even if unintentional. The combination of statistical anomalies, methodological irregularities, and expressed pressure to succeed creates a pattern that would be very improbable in legitimate research.\n\n8"
