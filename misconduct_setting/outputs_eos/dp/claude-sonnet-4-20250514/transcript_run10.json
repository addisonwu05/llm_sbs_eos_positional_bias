    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: This would be very likely (90-95%) given the lab-wide push to explore robustness and the fact that other students show identical patterns.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission: This would be quite likely (80-85%) as these are common, legitimate exclusion reasons that researchers would naturally document contemporaneously.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: The software switch would be moderately likely (60-70%) as labs do periodically update systems, and the hard drive failure would be moderately likely (70-80%) as IT-confirmed hardware failures are routine occurrences.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data passing independent audit: This would be very likely (95%+) to remain consistent if no misconduct occurred, as past good practices typically predict future good practices.\n\nThe combination of all four pieces of evidence occurring together, if no misconduct took place, represents multiple independent factors that are each individually plausible to highly likely. The convergence of legitimate explanations for suspicious patterns, combined with strong prior evidence of research integrity, creates a highly coherent scenario consistent with innocence.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: This would still be quite likely (70-80%) since someone committing misconduct would want their behavior to blend in with normal lab practices, and the lab-wide robustness exploration provides perfect cover.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with notes predating submission: This would be moderately likely (60-70%) as someone planning misconduct might preemptively create legitimate-looking exclusions to provide cover, or these could be genuinely legitimate exclusions unrelated to the misconduct.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure: The software switch would still be moderately likely (60-70%) as it's a lab-wide change unrelated to individual misconduct. The hard drive failure would be somewhat likely (50-60%) - while hardware failures do happen randomly, the timing is suspiciously convenient for destroying evidence.\n\n4. Prior record of clean data passing audit: This would be moderately likely (60-70%) since many cases of research misconduct involve individuals with previously clean records who face new pressures, and someone capable of sophisticated data manipulation might have been careful enough in earlier work to pass audits.\n\nThe combination represents a mix of genuinely coincidental factors, normal lab practices that provide cover, and potentially suspicious timing. While each element individually could occur with misconduct, the convergence of so many exonerating factors creates a scenario that would require either remarkable coincidence or very sophisticated planning.\n\n35"
