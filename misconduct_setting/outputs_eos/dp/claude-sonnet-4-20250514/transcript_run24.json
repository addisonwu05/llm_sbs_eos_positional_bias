    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria being common lab practice - this is quite typical in research environments focused on robustness testing. Given it was a \"lab-wide push\" and other students showed similar patterns, this would be expected behavior.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions with pre-submission documentation - this is standard research practice. These are legitimate, common exclusion criteria, and the pre-submission timing supports proper methodology.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hardware failure - both are routine occurrences in academic labs. The IT department confirmation of the hardware failure adds credibility.\n\n4. Prior clean record with documented, reproducible data that passed independent audit - this establishes a baseline of proper research conduct and competence.\n\nEach of these elements individually represents normal academic research conditions and practices. The combination, while creating some complexity in the investigation, consists entirely of plausible, documented events that would be expected in a legitimate research environment.\n\nThe key factors supporting this assessment are: institutional confirmation of technical issues, consistency with lab-wide practices, proper documentation timing, and established track record of good research practices.\n\n85"

    "content": "Looking at this scenario where Lena did commit misconduct, I need to assess how likely these specific pieces of evidence would still occur.\n\nThe multiple analysis scripts being similar to other students suggests this was genuine lab practice, not cover for misconduct. If Lena were fabricating data, she likely wouldn't need or want multiple different analysis approaches - she could simply create data that worked with one approach.\n\nThe participant exclusions with pre-submission notes are standard practice and would likely occur regardless of misconduct, as these represent legitimate methodological decisions that any researcher would make.\n\nThe software switch and hardware failure are external events confirmed by IT department - these would occur independently of any misconduct and actually create complications that someone committing fraud might want to avoid, as they create inconsistencies and missing files that could draw scrutiny.\n\nThe strong prior record of clean, well-documented research that passed independent audit is perhaps the most significant factor. Someone with an established pattern of proper research conduct would be less likely to suddenly engage in misconduct, and if they did, they would likely try to maintain their established standards of documentation to avoid suspicion.\n\nWhile it's possible for someone to commit misconduct despite having these characteristics, the combination of externally verified technical issues, lab-wide practices, proper documentation timing, and established good track record creates a scenario that would be somewhat unlikely if misconduct had actually occurred.\n\n25"

This undermines the fundamental purpose of preregistration.\n\nAn earlier analysis script containing participants later excluded, combined with the preregistration changes, suggests decisions were made based on how they affected results rather than methodological grounds.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several analyses is statistically very suspicious.

This pattern strongly suggests selective reporting, data manipulation, or \"p-hacking.\"\n\nWhile pressure and anxiety are normal, and some analytical exploration might be defensible, the combination of post-hoc preregistration changes, suspicious exclusions, and the highly unlikely p-value distribution creates a pattern that would be extremely improbable to occur through honest research practices and innocent mistakes alone.\n\nThese elements together represent systematic departures from research integrity that would be very unlikely to occur coincidentally in legitimate research.\n\n15"
