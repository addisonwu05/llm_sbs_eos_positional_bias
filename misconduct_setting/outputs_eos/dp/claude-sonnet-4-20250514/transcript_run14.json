    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence individually:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is standard practice in modern research for robustness checking, especially when it's part of a lab-wide initiative. Other students showing similar patterns strongly supports this being normal procedure.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions: These are common, legitimate exclusion reasons in cognitive studies. The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission indicates these were real-time decisions during data collection, not post-hoc manipulations.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and hard drive failure: Both events are independently documented by IT department and represent common technical issues in research labs. The timing and documentation make these credible mundane explanations for missing files.\n\n4. Clean prior record with independent audit: A previously clean record that passed independent scrutiny suggests consistent ethical research practices and competent data management skills.\n\nEach of these observations has reasonable, innocent explanations that are well-documented and consistent with normal research practices. The combination of all four occurring together, while perhaps creating an unfortunate appearance when viewed suspiciously, represents a plausible sequence of legitimate research activities and common technical problems.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts similar to other students: If Lena was fabricating data or results, she would likely try to make her practices appear normal.

Participant exclusions with pre-dating notes: A sophisticated fabricator could create backdated documentation or selectively exclude real participants to improve results while maintaining plausible documentation.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These genuine external events, if they occurred, would actually provide convenient cover for someone committing misconduct - explaining away missing files and inconsistencies that might otherwise raise suspicions.\n\n4. Clean prior record: Someone planning misconduct might specifically choose to be very careful in earlier work to establish credibility before attempting fraud on a high-stakes project. The pressure from the grant review could represent a motive for first-time misconduct.\n\nEven if committing misconduct, a careful perpetrator would try to maintain the appearance of normal research practices and could exploit genuine technical problems as cover. The documented external events (IT failure, lab-wide practices) would still occur regardless of Lena's intentions, and someone engaging in sophisticated data manipulation would likely try to work within existing legitimate frameworks.\n\n65"

Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05: This pattern is extremely difficult to explain through legitimate means. Natural data distributions should show p-values both above and below significance thresholds. This stark asymmetry strongly suggests p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2.
