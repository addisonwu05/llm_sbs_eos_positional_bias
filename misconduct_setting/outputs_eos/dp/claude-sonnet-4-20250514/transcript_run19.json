    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: This is very likely (90-95%) as it reflects standard exploratory data analysis practices, especially given the lab-wide push to explore robustness.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with pre-submission notes: This is quite likely (80-85%) as these are common issues in cognitive studies and the documentation predates submission.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: Software switches happen regularly in academic labs (70-80% likelihood), and hard drive failures are common technical issues (20-30% chance in any given timeframe). The IT confirmation adds credibility.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data passing independent audit: This strongly supports Lena's integrity and careful research practices (95%+ consistency with no misconduct).\n\nThe combination of all these factors occurring together if Lena is innocent involves some coincidental timing (particularly the hard drive failure during an investigation), but each element individually represents normal academic research circumstances. The prior clean audit record is particularly supportive of her integrity.\n\nConsidering the individual likelihoods and their intersection, while accounting for the somewhat coincidental timing of some events:\n\n82"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: If committing misconduct, she might create multiple scripts to find favorable results (p-hacking), and the lab-wide pattern provides cover. This could still occur (70-80%).\n\n2. Participant exclusions with pre-submission notes: If fabricating data, she could easily create backdated documentation or genuinely exclude problematic participants while still manipulating other aspects. Quite likely (75-85%).\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: The software switch is independent of her actions (80-90% likely regardless). However, a convenient hard drive failure that destroys potentially incriminating evidence during misconduct is highly suspicious - this would be extremely fortunate timing for someone trying to hide evidence (10-20% as genuine coincidence, though she couldn't control the IT confirmation).\n\n4. Prior clean audit record: This is the most problematic element for the misconduct scenario. Someone willing to fabricate data would likely have shown earlier signs or patterns. A completely clean prior record followed by sudden major misconduct is less common, though pressure situations can trigger first-time offenses (30-40%).\n\nThe combination presents mixed signals - some elements provide good cover for misconduct, but the clean prior record and the very convenient timing of evidence-destroying hardware failure create significant contradictions.\n\n25"
