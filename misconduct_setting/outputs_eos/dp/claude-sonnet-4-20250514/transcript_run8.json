    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students: This would be very likely in a legitimate research environment where the lab was systematically exploring robustness of findings. The fact that other students show similar patterns strongly supports this being standard lab practice.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission: This would be extremely likely in honest research. These are common, legitimate reasons for exclusion, and the pre-dating notes indicate proper documentation rather than post-hoc justification.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: These are mundane technical issues that happen regularly in research settings. The IT department confirmation adds credibility.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit: This would be expected if Lena maintains consistent honest research practices.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only plausible but would be quite typical in legitimate research conducted by a careful researcher. The combination of systematic lab practices, proper documentation, routine technical issues with third-party verification, and consistent past performance creates a coherent picture of honest research work.\n\n85"

Creating notes that predate submission would be a sophisticated way to make exclusions appear legitimate and pre-planned.\n\n3.

A hard drive failure especially could obscure evidence of improper data handling.\n\n4. Prior clean record and passed audit: Someone committing misconduct might specifically choose to do so on a high-stakes project (major grant review pressure) even with a previously clean record. Past good behavior doesn't preclude future misconduct, especially under increased pressure.\n\nThe timing of technical issues that obscure data trails, combined with pressure for results and the \"too perfect\" data patterns noted by the whistleblower, could indicate sophisticated misconduct disguised by legitimate-seeming circumstances.\n\n45"
