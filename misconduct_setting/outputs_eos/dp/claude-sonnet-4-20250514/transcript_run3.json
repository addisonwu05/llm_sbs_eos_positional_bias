    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students in the lab during a lab-wide robustness exploration - this is very common in legitimate research practice and matches the broader lab culture.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission - this is standard exclusion practice with proper documentation timing.\n\n3. Lab switching statistical software mid-project - software transitions happen regularly in research labs for various legitimate reasons.\n\n4. Confirmed hard drive failure leading to file loss - hardware failures are common occurrences that IT departments routinely document.\n\n5. Prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit - this establishes a baseline of good research practices.\n\nEach of these events individually has a high probability of occurring in legitimate research. The combination, while perhaps creating an unfortunate appearance when viewed through the lens of misconduct allegations, represents a plausible set of circumstances that would naturally co-occur in a functioning research environment where no misconduct took place.\n\nThe documentation trail (predating notes, IT confirmation, audit records, lab-wide practices) supports the authenticity of these explanations.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - this is standard practice that would exist regardless of misconduct, especially since other students show similar patterns and it was part of a lab-wide initiative.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with predating notes - legitimate exclusions would still occur even if other data were manipulated, and these notes genuinely predate submission.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure - these are external events confirmed by IT that would occur independently of any misconduct.\n\n4. Prior clean audit record - someone who later commits misconduct could easily have been conducting legitimate research previously, especially early in their career.\n\nThe key insight is that misconduct typically involves subtle manipulation or fabrication alongside legitimate research practices. Most of the research process would still follow normal procedures - the misconduct would likely be targeted manipulation of specific results rather than wholesale fabrication of the entire research environment and history.\n\nThese background elements (software issues, hardware problems, standard lab practices, legitimate exclusions) would provide convenient cover for misconduct while still being genuine aspects of the research process.\n\n75"
