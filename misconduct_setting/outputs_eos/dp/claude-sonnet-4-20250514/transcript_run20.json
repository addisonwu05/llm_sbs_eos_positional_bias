    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is very common in legitimate research, especially with a lab-wide push for robustness testing. Other students showing similar patterns strongly supports this being normal practice.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions: This is routine in cognitive studies. The fact that exclusion notes predate journal submission is important evidence of proper procedure.\n\n3. Software switch mid-project and confirmed hard drive failure: The IT department confirmation makes this verifiable. Software transitions are common in academic labs, and hardware failures happen regularly.\n\n4. Prior clean record with independent audit: This establishes a baseline of proper research conduct and careful data management practices.\n\n5. Well-documented previous work: This reinforces her track record of legitimate research practices.\n\nIf Lena is innocent, these elements would be expected or at least very plausible:\n- Good researchers typically do have clean prior records\n- Robustness testing with multiple scripts is standard practice\n- Participant exclusions for valid reasons are routine\n- Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are common\n- Documentation that predates submission suggests proper planning rather than post-hoc manipulation\n\nThe combination of her established track record, normal research practices, verifiable technical issues, and proper documentation timeline creates a coherent picture that would be quite likely if she committed no misconduct.\n\n85"

    "content": "Looking at this scenario from the perspective that Lena did commit misconduct, I need to assess how likely these specific pieces of evidence would still occur.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, several of these elements would still be quite likely:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: Someone committing misconduct might actually be MORE likely to run multiple analyses to find favorable results (p-hacking). The fact that other students show similar patterns provides cover and makes this behavior appear normal.\n\n2. Prior clean record and independent audit: Many cases of academic misconduct involve researchers with previously good records who face pressure. The prior clean record doesn't prevent later misconduct - it might even make someone feel they can get away with it.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These are external, verifiable events that would occur regardless of misconduct. The timing could even be convenient for someone wanting to obscure evidence or claim confusion.\n\n4. Participant exclusions with predated notes: If someone is sophisticated enough to commit misconduct, they might also be careful enough to create proper documentation that appears legitimate. Excluding participants for plausible reasons with backdated notes is not particularly difficult.\n\nThe combination suggests either genuine research practices OR relatively sophisticated misconduct where someone took care to maintain plausible explanations and documentation. The verified technical issues and lab-wide practices provide good cover for misconduct.\n\nMost of these elements would still occur even with misconduct, and some might even facilitate it.\n\n70"

Someone engaging in research fraud would very likely do this to legitimize their manipulated findings.\n\n3.
