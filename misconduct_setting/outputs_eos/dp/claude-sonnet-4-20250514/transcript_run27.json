    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence individually if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students in the lab during a lab-wide robustness exploration - this would be very common and expected behavior in legitimate research practice.\n\n2. Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions, with pre-submission documentation - this is standard practice for legitimate data quality control.\n\n3. Lab switching software mid-project and confirmed hardware failure causing file loss - these are routine technical issues that occur regularly in research environments.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit - this strongly supports a pattern of legitimate research conduct.\n\nEach of these individual events is quite plausible in normal research operations. The combination of all four occurring together, while perhaps somewhat coincidental, still represents a very reasonable scenario for legitimate research. The evidence collectively paints a picture consistent with standard research practices, technical difficulties that commonly occur in lab environments, and a researcher with an established track record of proper conduct.\n\n85"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students - If Lena committed misconduct, this pattern would still likely exist since it reflects lab-wide practices that are independent of her individual actions. The misconduct could have occurred within this normal framework.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with pre-submission notes - If committing misconduct, Lena would likely still follow standard practices for obvious exclusions to maintain plausibility. These exclusions appear legitimate and would be expected even with misconduct.\n\n3. Software switch and confirmed hardware failure - These are external, verifiable events independent of Lena's actions. A software switch is a lab decision, and the hardware failure is IT-confirmed. These would occur regardless of misconduct.\n\n4. Prior record of clean data from independent audit - This is the most challenging element. However, misconduct often develops over time due to increasing pressure. A previously clean record doesn't preclude later misconduct, especially under the described pressures of grant reviews and high-stakes publications.\n\nSomeone committing misconduct would likely try to embed it within normal-appearing research practices and could take advantage of legitimate disruptions (software changes, hardware failures) as cover for irregularities.\n\n70"
