    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to analyze how likely this set of events is if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe data management logs showing multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria is not unusual - this is described as part of a lab-wide practice for robustness testing, with other students showing similar patterns. This is consistent with good scientific practice.\n\nThe exclusion of two participants with notes predating submission is strong evidence of proper procedure - these exclusions were documented before any submission, suggesting they weren't post-hoc adjustments.\n\nThe software switch mid-project is a common occurrence in labs. The hard drive failure, while unfortunate, is confirmed by the IT department, providing independent verification of this explanation for missing files.\n\nMost significantly, Lena has a documented history of proper data management, with her previous work passing an independent audit where her data was rated as \"well-documented and reproducible.\"\n\nNone of these events is particularly unlikely, and they align with normal research challenges and good scientific practices. If Lena did not commit misconduct, all these events would be quite expected in the normal course of research.\n\n70"

This practice exists in labs but could be exploited for misconduct.\n\nThe excluded participants with notes predating submission is interesting - if she committed fraud, she might have created these exclusion notes strategically, knowing documentation is important. However, fabricating such notes requires foresight.\n\nThe software switch mid-project and hard drive failure would be convenient explanations for missing files or inconsistencies if misconduct occurred. These events happened (confirmed by IT), but their timing could be opportunistically used to cover manipulation.\n\nHer prior record of clean data handling is the most inconsistent element with misconduct. People typically don't suddenly begin misconduct without prior issues, though the pressure of a high-profile study with a supervisor needing results for a grant could create unusual circumstances.\n\nOverall, while possible, these circumstances seem somewhat less likely if she committed misconduct.\n\n40"
