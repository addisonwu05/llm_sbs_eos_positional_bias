    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

This practice is legitimate in scientific research.\n\nThe exclusion of two participants with documented issues (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with pre-submission notes is standard practice and highly expected in a properly run study.\n\nSoftware changes mid-project are common in academic settings, and hard drive failures are random events that happen to researchers regardless of their ethical standing. The IT confirmation makes this particularly credible.\n\nHaving a prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed an independent audit strongly suggests Lena follows good research practices consistently.\n\nNone of these events seem unusual or suspicious; in fact, they paint a picture of normal research challenges and proper documentation practices. The combination of these factors would be quite likely for an honest researcher.\n\n75"

Many researchers who commit misconduct have previously published legitimate work.\n\nConsidering all factors together - some support misconduct (like multiple analyses) while others make misconduct less likely (like pre-dated exclusion notes) - the overall probability is moderate.\n\n45"

This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation and is extremely rare in unmanipulated datasets.\n\nModifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes violates fundamental principles of preregistration and is considered a serious breach of research integrity. While innocent mistakes in preregistration can happen, changing key elements like exclusion criteria after seeing the data strongly suggests outcome-driven decisions.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with additional participants who were later excluded is not inherently problematic if there were legitimate reasons for exclusion, but combined with the modified preregistration, it raises concerns.\n\nThe emails about needing the study \"to work\" and concerns about career implications show clear motivation for misconduct. While pressure and career concerns are common, explicitly connecting study outcomes to career prospects in writing suggests a concerning mindset.\n\nGiven this combination of factors - especially the p-value distribution and changed preregistration - if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability is very low.\n\n10"
