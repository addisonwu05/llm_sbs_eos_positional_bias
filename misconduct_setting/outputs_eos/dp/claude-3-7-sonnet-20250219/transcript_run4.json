    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to consider how likely the various pieces of evidence would be if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nFor the data management logs showing multiple analysis scripts: This is actually quite common in research, especially when exploring robustness of findings. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this is standard lab practice, not suspicious behavior.\n\nThe excluded participants with notes predating submission: This is standard practice in research - excluding participants based on clear criteria (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) and documenting it contemporaneously.\n\nSoftware switch and hard drive failure: Technical issues and software transitions happen regularly in research environments. The IT department's confirmation adds credibility to this explanation.\n\nPrior record of clean, well-documented data: This establishes a pattern of good research practices, making it more likely that current practices are also legitimate.\n\nNone of these things are particularly unusual in research settings. Multiple analysis approaches are common in exploratory research. Participant exclusions with proper documentation are standard. Technical issues are frequent. And having a good track record is consistent with continued good practices.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, it would be quite likely to observe this constellation of events, as they represent typical research practices and common technical challenges.\n\n80"

If she was trying different analyses until finding significant results, this evidence could be expected.\n\nThe excluded participants with predated notes is interesting - if she committed misconduct, she might have carefully documented legitimate exclusions while manipulating other data. This wouldn't necessarily be unlikely.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure could potentially be convenient explanations for missing files that might have shown evidence of data manipulation. While the IT department confirmed the hardware failure, if Lena committed misconduct, she might have taken advantage of this legitimate incident.\n\nHer prior clean record doesn't align well with misconduct, unless this is her first time engaging in it due to increased pressure from her professor for publishable results.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, some of these observations would be expected (multiple analyses), some might be opportunistically used (hardware failure), and some would be somewhat contradictory (clean prior record). Overall, the combination isn't impossible but isn't highly likely either if misconduct occurred.\n\n40"
