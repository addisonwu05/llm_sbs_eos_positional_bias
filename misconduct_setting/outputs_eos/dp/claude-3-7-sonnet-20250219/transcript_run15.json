    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of these events occurring if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, I'll examine each piece of information:\n\n1. Multiple alternative analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria: This seems highly probable in honest research, especially since it was part of a lab-wide initiative and other students showed similar patterns. Robustness checks are good scientific practice.\n\n2. Two participants excluded based on documented issues (falling asleep/not understanding instructions): These are standard, legitimate exclusion criteria, and importantly, the documentation predates the submission, suggesting they weren't post-hoc exclusions to get desired results.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: Both are independently confirmed events. Software transitions happen in labs, and hardware failures are common enough occurrences.\n\n4. Prior record of clean, well-documented data: This establishes a pattern of good scientific conduct by Lena in the past.\n\nNone of these events is particularly unusual, and together they present a coherent picture of normal research processes with some typical technical challenges. The pattern doesn't suggest misconduct - rather, it shows documentation of legitimate research decisions and some unfortunate but common technical issues.\n\n85"

The technical issues in particular could create opportunities to hide evidence. However, the pre-existing documentation for exclusions and her clean prior record do reduce the overall probability somewhat.\n\n65"

    "content": "Examining these new details:\n\n1. Emails expressing pressure and career concerns: While concerning, researchers often feel pressure for positive results. These statements show motive but don't directly prove misconduct.\n\n2. Concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above: This is a major statistical red flag. In genuine research, p-values typically distribute more evenly around the threshold. This pattern strongly suggests p-hacking.\n\n3. Preregistration modified after data collection: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is a serious violation of research integrity.\n\n4. Additional participants excluded from final dataset compared to earlier analysis: This suggests selective reporting of data to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these patterns would be extremely unlikely to occur together by chance. The p-value distribution alone is highly suspicious, and when combined with post-data preregistration changes and selective participant exclusion, the probability becomes exceptionally low.\n\n5"
