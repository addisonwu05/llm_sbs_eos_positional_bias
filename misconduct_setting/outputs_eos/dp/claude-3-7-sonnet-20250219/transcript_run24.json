    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to assess the likelihood of all these events occurring together if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nLet's examine each point:\n\n1) Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is actually a good research practice, especially for robustness checks. The fact that other students did the same thing suggests this was standard lab protocol, not suspicious behavior.\n\n2) Excluding two participants with documented reasons predating submission: This is standard research practice and the documentation timing supports legitimate exclusion.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These technical issues happen in research environments. The IT department confirmed the hardware failure, giving this credibility.\n\n4) Prior clean record with well-documented data: This establishes a pattern of good research conduct before the current study.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these events are all reasonably likely to occur. Multiple analysis scripts are common in thorough research. Participant exclusions with documentation are standard practice. Technical issues like software changes and hardware failures are common in research settings. And her prior clean record is consistent with someone who conducts research properly.\n\nNone of these elements are particularly unusual in research contexts, and they align with normal research practices and challenges.\n\n70"

The similarity to other students' practices provides good cover for potentially questionable research practices.\n\n2) The documented exclusions predating submission: These could be legitimate even if misconduct occurred elsewhere in the analysis. Misconduct doesn't mean every research decision was fraudulent.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These events could provide convenient explanations for missing files or analysis inconsistencies that might otherwise raise red flags. However, the IT confirmation makes the hard drive failure likely genuine.\n\n4) Prior clean record: People who commit misconduct often have clean records before their first violation. Past good behavior doesn't preclude current misconduct, especially under pressure from a supervisor needing results for a grant review.\n\nIf misconduct occurred, most of these circumstances could either be coincidental, part of the deception, or convenient explanations for irregularities. The software switch and participant exclusions could happen regardless of misconduct, and the hard drive failure appears genuine based on IT confirmation.\n\n55"

In legitimate research, we would expect a more even distribution of p-values on both sides of .05.\n\n2) Modifying preregistration after data collection: This fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to document hypotheses and methods before seeing the data. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection is a serious breach of research integrity.\n\n3) Earlier analysis script with additional participants: This suggests selective exclusion of participants, potentially to achieve desired results.\n\n4) Emails about needing the study to \"work\": While pressure is common in academia, the language suggests Lena felt a need for specific outcomes rather than accurate results.\n\nFor all these circumstances to exist without misconduct would be extremely unlikely. The p-value distribution alone is highly suspicious. Combined with post-data preregistration changes and the excluded participants, the evidence strongly suggests intentional manipulation of analyses to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n5"
