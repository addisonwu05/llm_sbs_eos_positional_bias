    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely the observed evidence would be if Lena did NOT commit misconduct.\n\nLet's analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1) Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is consistent with the lab's practices for testing robustness, and other students show similar patterns. This would be fairly likely under the hypothesis of innocence.\n\n2) Two participants excluded with notes predating submission: Excluding participants who fall asleep or don't understand instructions is standard practice, and the documentation predates submission. This is very likely under innocence.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These technological issues are independently confirmed by IT. While unfortunate timing, such issues are common in research and not particularly unlikely.\n\n4) Prior record of clean data handling: Her previous work passed an independent audit and was rated well-documented. This strongly suggests she has good data practices.\n\nNone of these observations are particularly surprising for an honest researcher. The software switch and hard drive failure might be somewhat unlucky, but they're independently verified. The multiple analysis scripts are actually expected in robust research, and proper exclusion documentation is good practice.\n\nConsidering all factors together, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this collection of evidence would be quite high.\n\n75"

This would be fairly likely for someone committing misconduct.\n\nTwo participants excluded with predated notes: Even someone committing fraud would likely follow standard exclusion practices. These exclusions appear legitimate with appropriate documentation.\n\nSoftware switch and hard drive failure: These events are independently verified by IT. While they could potentially serve as a convenient excuse to hide manipulation, they're genuine occurrences that would happen regardless of misconduct.\n\nPrior clean record: This is the most challenging to reconcile with misconduct. If Lena did commit fraud in this study, it would be somewhat surprising that she had a previously clean record with well-documented work that passed an audit. This suggests this would be her first instance of misconduct, possibly due to the pressure of the high-profile study.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, the technological issues and multiple analyses would still be likely to occur, the exclusions appear legitimate regardless, but her prior clean record makes this scenario somewhat less likely.\n\n40"
