    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "The lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to assess the likelihood of all these events occurring together if Lena didn't commit misconduct.\n\n1) Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is described as part of a lab-wide practice to test robustness, with other students showing similar patterns. This would be very likely in an innocent scenario, as exploring different exclusion criteria is good scientific practice.\n\n2) The two participants excluded with notes predating submission: This represents proper documentation and legitimate exclusion, which would be expected in rigorous research.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These technical issues are independently confirmed (IT department verified the hardware failure). Such technical problems are fairly common in research.\n\n4) Prior record of clean, well-documented data: If Lena is honest and careful, her prior work would naturally reflect this.\n\nNone of these observations seems particularly unlikely in the absence of misconduct. In fact, they collectively paint a picture of normal research challenges (technical issues) alongside good research practices (proper exclusion documentation, multiple analysis approaches for robustness, and a history of good data management).\n\nThe probability that all these events would occur if Lena did not commit misconduct is: 80"

This pattern being lab-wide doesn't exclude her misusing this practice.\n\nThe excluded participants with notes predating submission is still plausible even with misconduct - proper documentation of exclusions could exist alongside other manipulations not captured in these particular notes.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure could potentially provide convenient cover for missing files that might have revealed inconsistencies. While the hardware failure was confirmed, the timing might be opportunistic.\n\nHer prior clean record doesn't strongly argue against current misconduct - researchers with previously solid work can still engage in questionable practices, especially under pressure for significant findings in a high-profile study.\n\nThese circumstances don't prevent misconduct and some might even facilitate it, though they don't directly prove it either.\n\n65"
