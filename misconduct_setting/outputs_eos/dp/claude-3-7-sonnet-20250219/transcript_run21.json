    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely it is to observe this combination of events if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nLet's examine each piece of information:\n\n1. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be standard practice in the lab (\"lab-wide push to explore robustness\"), and other students show similar patterns. This would be very common if she did not commit misconduct.\n\n2. Two participants excluded with pre-submission documentation: This is proper scientific procedure - excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is legitimate, especially when documented before submission.\n\n3. Software switch and hard drive failure: These are verified external events confirmed by IT. Technical issues happen in research regardless of researcher integrity.\n\n4. Prior clean record with well-documented data: This establishes a pattern of ethical behavior in previous work. The independent audit provides strong evidence of her normal adherence to good practices.\n\nAll of these circumstances are quite common in research settings and would be entirely consistent with honest research practices. None of them indicate misconduct, and in fact, proper documentation of exclusions and multiple analysis approaches often indicate transparency rather than fraud.\n\nGiven all these factors, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this constellation of events would be quite high.\n\n75"

A person committing fraud might not bother with legitimate documentation of exclusions.\n\nThe software switch and hard drive failure are externally verified events that would happen regardless of misconduct, but could potentially be used as cover for missing data if misconduct occurred.\n\nHer prior clean record passing an audit is significant - people who commit misconduct often don't have spotless prior records, though first-time misconduct is certainly possible, especially under pressure.\n\nIf Lena did commit misconduct, some of these observations (like proper exclusion documentation and clean prior record) would be somewhat unexpected, while others (multiple analysis versions) could be consistent with misconduct.\n\nGiven the complete constellation of observations, if she did commit misconduct, the probability of seeing all these specific circumstances together would be relatively low.\n\n30"

In honest research, p-values typically distribute more evenly around the significance threshold. This pattern strongly suggests p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nChanging preregistration documents after data collection to modify exclusion criteria and primary outcomes violates fundamental principles of preregistration, which is designed specifically to prevent researcher degrees of freedom. This is a serious methodological violation.\n\nHaving earlier scripts with additional participants who were later excluded could be legitimate if there were valid reasons, but combined with the other factors, raises concerns about selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\nThe emails indicate strong motivation and pressure to find significant results, which creates a concerning conflict of interest. While feeling pressure isn't misconduct itself, it establishes a clear motive.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, this combination of statistical anomalies (unusual p-value distribution), procedural violations (changing preregistration post-data collection), and documented motivation to produce significant results would be extremely unlikely to occur together by chance or through honest errors.\n\n10"
