    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To assess the probability that Lena did not commit misconduct given these observations, I'll analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1) Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This appears to be standard practice in the lab as part of robustness testing, with other students showing similar patterns. This is consistent with thorough scientific practice rather than misconduct.\n\n2) The exclusion of two participants with documented issues: The exclusion notes predate the journal submission, suggesting legitimate exclusion rather than post-hoc manipulation.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These events were independently confirmed by IT, providing a plausible explanation for missing files that might otherwise seem suspicious.\n\n4) Clean prior record: Lena has demonstrated good data management practices in the past, with her previous work passing an independent audit.\n\nAll these observations are compatible with honest research practices and explanations for any irregularities. While the whistleblower's concerns and the \"too perfect\" results raise some questions, the documented evidence strongly supports Lena's explanation of honest mistakes or miscommunication rather than fraud.\n\nThe probability that these circumstances would exist if Lena did not commit misconduct is quite high.\n\n85"

However, the IT department did confirm these events happened.\n\nHer prior clean record is certainly possible even if she committed misconduct in this case - past performance doesn't guarantee future behavior, especially under pressure from a supervisor needing publishable results before a grant review.\n\nOverall, while some of these circumstances might be leveraged by someone committing misconduct, the combination of all these factors still occurring if misconduct happened is moderately likely.\n\n60"

    "content": "I need to assess how likely these new pieces of evidence would be observed if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\n1) The emails showing pressure and career concerns: While concerning, researchers often feel pressure for significant results. This alone doesn't prove misconduct, though it establishes motive.\n\n2) Earlier scripts including participants later excluded: This could indicate legitimate refinement of exclusion criteria or p-hacking. Without knowing the justification for these exclusions, this is concerning.\n\n3) Unusual concentration of p-values just below .05 and almost none just above: This pattern is a classic statistical red flag for p-hacking or data manipulation, as it's highly unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses.\n\n4) Modifying preregistration after data collection: Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data severely undermines the purpose of preregistration and strongly suggests result-driven decisions.\n\nCombined with the previous evidence, these new findings significantly reduce the probability of innocence. The modified preregistration and suspicious p-value distribution in particular are extremely difficult to explain through honest research practices.\n\n15"
