    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nLena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "To determine the likelihood of all these events occurring if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, I'll analyze each piece of evidence:\n\n1) Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria: This is described as part of a lab-wide practice of exploring robustness, with other students showing similar patterns. This is actually common practice in scientific research and represents good thoroughness rather than misconduct.\n\n2) Two excluded participants with documentation predating submission: This is standard scientific practice. The fact that the exclusion notes predate the journal submission strongly suggests legitimate exclusions rather than post-hoc manipulation.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure: These technical issues have independent confirmation from IT, making them credible explanations for any file inconsistencies.\n\n4) Prior clean record with well-documented data: Lena's previous work passed an independent audit and was rated as \"well-documented and reproducible,\" suggesting she has established good scientific practices.\n\nIf Lena is innocent, all these events represent normal scientific work and ordinary technical challenges. None are particularly unusual in research settings. The multiple analyses represent thoroughness, the exclusions appear properly documented, the technical issues were confirmed, and her history suggests integrity.\n\n85"

This pattern is highly improbable through chance alone.\n\n2) Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes defeats the entire purpose of preregistration, which is to commit to analytical decisions before seeing the data. This is a serious deviation from scientific best practices.\n\n3) The earlier script with additional participants who were later excluded suggests potential selective removal of participants to achieve desired results, especially when combined with the modified preregistration.\n\n4) The emails reveal clear motivation for misconduct - career pressure, grant funding concerns, and explicit statements about needing positive results.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, this combination of evidence would be extremely unlikely.
