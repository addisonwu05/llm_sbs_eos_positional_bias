    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "I need to assess how likely the given observations would be if Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1) Having multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria - This is actually common practice in exploratory data analysis and robustness checking. The fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this is standard in the lab.\n\n2) Excluding two participants with documented issues - Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is standard practice. The key point is that the notes predate the journal submission, suggesting this was done according to proper protocol.\n\n3) Software switch and hard drive failure - Technical issues and software transitions happen in research settings. The IT department confirmed the hard drive failure, providing independent verification.\n\n4) Prior record of clean data practices - Lena's previous work passed an independent audit, showing a history of proper research conduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, all of these observations are quite consistent with normal research practices combined with some typical technical challenges. The multiple analyses could reflect thoroughness rather than p-hacking, the exclusions appear properly documented, the technical issues are independently verified, and her prior record supports her credibility.\n\n75"

However, since other students show similar patterns, this appears to be lab practice rather than individual misconduct.\n\n2) The excluded participants with documentation predating submission is harder to explain as misconduct, as falsifying these records would require foresight.\n\n3) The software switch and hard drive failure could potentially provide cover for manipulated data, but the hard drive failure was independently verified by IT.\n\n4) Her prior clean record makes a sudden shift to misconduct less likely, though not impossible. People with previously clean records can still commit misconduct under pressure.\n\nIf she did commit misconduct, these circumstances combine both potentially suspicious elements (multiple analyses) with elements that would be difficult to explain as part of misconduct (pre-dated exclusion notes, independently verified hard drive failure, and her previously clean record).\n\n40"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these observations would be if Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct.\n\nLooking at each piece of evidence:\n\n1) The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 is statistically very unusual and strongly suggests p-hacking or selective reporting. This pattern rarely occurs naturally in data.\n\n2) Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes violates fundamental principles of preregistration. This directly undermines the purpose of preregistration.\n\n3) The earlier analysis script including participants later excluded suggests changing criteria to achieve desired results.\n\n4) The emails show strong motivation and pressure to find significant results, creating a clear incentive for misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, these findings would be extremely unlikely to appear together. The p-value distribution alone is highly suspicious, and when combined with modified preregistration, changed participant inclusion, and explicit statements about needing positive results, the pattern strongly suggests intentional manipulation.\n\n5"
