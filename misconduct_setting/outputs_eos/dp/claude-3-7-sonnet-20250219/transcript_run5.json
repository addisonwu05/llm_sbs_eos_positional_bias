    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Lena has no prior record of data irregularities in previous studies. Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Running multiple analysis scripts with varying exclusion criteria is standard practice in robust research, especially in a lab that explicitly encourages exploring robustness. This is not suspicious but reflects good scientific practice.\n\n2. The two excluded participants were documented properly before submission, which indicates transparent documentation rather than post-hoc manipulation.\n\n3. Software changes and hardware failures are common in academic settings. The hard drive failure was independently confirmed by IT.\n\n4. Most importantly, Lena has a documented history of good data practices that passed an independent audit. Past behavior is generally predictive of future behavior.\n\nThese circumstances would be expected in the normal course of academic research. While they could potentially provide cover for misconduct, there's nothing in these specific elements that suggests wrongdoing. The coincidence of all these factors occurring simultaneously is not particularly suspicious, as these are common events in research labs.\n\nBased on these considerations, if Lena did not commit misconduct, the probability of observing this constellation of facts is quite high.\n\n75"

Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria could actually be consistent with p-hacking or searching for significant results. This practice, while potentially legitimate, could also enable selective reporting of favorable outcomes.\n\n2. The proper documentation of excluded participants doesn't rule out misconduct elsewhere in the analysis or with other participants.\n\n3. The software switch and hard drive failure, while independently confirmed, could conveniently explain missing files that might have contained evidence of data manipulation.\n\n4. Having a prior clean record is common even among researchers who later commit misconduct - many cases of scientific fraud involve previously respected researchers.\n\nThese circumstances could provide both opportunity and plausible deniability for misconduct. The multiple analysis versions in particular might be concerning in this context. However, the pre-dated exclusion notes and previously clean audit do make widespread fabrication somewhat less likely.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Lena did commit misconduct, the probability of observing this specific constellation of factors is moderate.\n\n50"

    "content": "I need to evaluate how likely these observations would be if Lena did NOT commit misconduct.\n\nThe new evidence presents several concerning patterns:\n\n1. The clustering of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is a statistical anomaly that strongly suggests p-hacking or selective reporting, as this pattern rarely occurs naturally in genuine data.\n\n2. Modifying a preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent researcher degrees of freedom.\n\n3. The excluded participants in earlier analyses that don't appear in the final dataset, without clear documentation for their removal, suggests potential data selection to achieve desired results.\n\n4. Lena's emails reveal strong outcome-dependent motivations and pressure, which while not direct evidence of misconduct, establish a clear motive.\n\nThese patterns together represent multiple red flags that would be extremely unlikely to occur innocently. While any single element might have an innocent explanation (career concerns are common, and some post-hoc exclusions can be legitimate), the combination of altered preregistration, suspicious p-value distribution, and unexplained participant exclusions would be highly improbable without some form of data manipulation.\n\nIf Lena did NOT commit misconduct, the probability of observing all these patterns is very low.\n\n10"
