    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider the probability of these events occurring without misconduct. \n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This can occur due to various factors including p-hacking, which is a form of academic misconduct. However, it can also occur by chance or due to other non-malicious practices, though the latter are less likely to result in such a concentrated pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to align with the results obtained can be seen as a form of academic misconduct if not properly disclosed. It's possible that this was an honest mistake or miscommunication, but it still raises suspicions.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants later excluded**: Excluding participants post-hoc can be legitimate if based on pre-defined criteria. However, if these exclusions were not preregistered or were done in a way that significantly impacts the results, it could be considered questionable. \n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails suggest that Lena had a motive to manipulate the data (due to the pressure from her supervisor and the impact on her career), they do not directly imply misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect the data and analysis decisions to be less influenced by the outcomes. The concentration of p-values just below .05 is unusual under innocence. Modifying the preregistration document after data collection and excluding participants not in line with the initial plan (as suggested by the difference in the analysis scripts) are practices that, while potentially justifiable, are suspicious without clear, innocent explanations.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it's not impossible that all these events happened without misconduct (e.g., due to a series of honest mistakes or unforeseen circumstances), the combination and nature of the findings make it quite improbable.\n\nGiven the combination of evidence, the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct and that all these observations occurred by chance or due to innocent reasons is very low.\n\n18"

If Lena manipulated the data or analyses to achieve significant results, this pattern would be expected.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration after seeing the data to match the results obtained is a form of misconduct.

It suggests transparency and an attempt to understand the data fully.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions is a reasonable practice if the decision was made based on pre-defined criteria and documented before the analysis outcomes were known. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports this interpretation.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are plausible events that can happen in the course of research. They provide a mundane explanation for some of the irregularities or discrepancies observed (e.g., file loss, changes in analysis scripts).\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: Lena's history of maintaining well-documented and reproducible data in earlier projects that passed an independent audit supports the notion that she is capable of conducting research with integrity.\n\nGiven that Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the evidence described is quite plausible. Running multiple analysis scripts is a sign of thoroughness, excluding participants based on documented issues is standard practice, switching software and experiencing a hard drive failure are unfortunate but possible events, and having a clean record in the past supports her integrity.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of observing this evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct is relatively high.\n\n82"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might still have run multiple scripts to appear diligent.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on pre-existing notes**: This action is justifiable and not necessarily indicative of misconduct.
