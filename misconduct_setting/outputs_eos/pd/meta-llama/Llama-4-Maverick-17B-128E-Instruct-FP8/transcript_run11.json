    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider how plausible it is for the described events and data patterns to occur without any intentional manipulation or fabrication.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting. However, it could also occur by chance or due to other factors. The probability of this happening by chance is low, especially if it occurs across multiple analyses.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a process meant to increase transparency by documenting the study's methodology and analysis plan before data collection. Changing the preregistration document after data collection, especially to alter exclusion criteria and primary outcomes, raises suspicions of adjusting the plan to fit the results. This action, while not definitively indicating misconduct, is highly irregular and not in line with best practices.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: The exclusion of participants can be a legitimate part of data analysis, but doing so in a way that significantly alters the results or was not preregistered can be problematic. The presence of an earlier script with more participants suggests that decisions about who to include or exclude were made post-data collection.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure to produce a certain result**: Lena's emails to a friend highlight the pressure she was under to achieve a certain outcome, both for her career and for her supervisor's grant. While this pressure is real and significant, it doesn't directly imply misconduct. However, it provides a motive.\n\nGiven these observations, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we are left to consider whether these factors could plausibly occur through innocent means. \n\n- The pressure to publish and the emails expressing that pressure are common in academia and don't necessarily imply misconduct.\n- The other factors (p-value distribution, modification of preregistration, and changes in participant inclusion) are more directly related to the integrity of the research process.\n\nWhile it's possible to concoct innocent explanations for each of these (e.g., the p-value distribution could be a fluke, the preregistration modification could be a genuine correction of an oversight, and participants could have been legitimately excluded based on criteria decided before seeing the data), the combination of all these factors strains credulity.\n\nThe likelihood that all these events occurred without misconduct, given their cumulative improbability and the context provided, is very low.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it would be plausible that she manipulated data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration to fit the data is a suspicious behavior that could be indicative of misconduct, as it allows for post-hoc adjustments that can bias the results towards significance or the desired outcome.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible that she selectively excluded participants to achieve the desired results or to make the data \"cleaner.\"\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a need for the study to \"work\"**: While these emails provide motive rather than direct evidence of misconduct, they suggest that Lena had a strong incentive to produce certain results.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the described evidence becomes more plausible:\n- Manipulating data or analyses could result in an unusual distribution of p-values.\n- Modifying the preregistration document post-data collection could be part of adjusting the study's plan to fit the manipulated results.\n- Excluding certain participants in the final analysis could be a part of the manipulation to achieve desired outcomes.\n- The emails provide a context where such actions might be considered or undertaken under pressure.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would see the patterns and behaviors described.\n\n85"

The fact that other students in the lab did the same supports that this was part of a lab culture or policy, making it plausible.\n\n2. **Excluding two participants based on notes in the raw data files that predate journal submission**: Excluding participants based on valid criteria (e.g., not understanding instructions or falling asleep) is a standard practice. The notes predating the journal submission suggest that this decision was made before the outcome was known, supporting its legitimacy.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: Technical issues and changes in software are common in research environments. The IT department's confirmation of a hardware failure supports the plausibility of file loss due to a hard drive failure.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean and well-documented data**: Having a history of well-documented and reproducible research practices, as verified by an independent audit, supports the notion that Lena is capable of conducting research without misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would explore different analysis scripts as part of a lab-wide practice.\n- She would exclude participants based on legitimate reasons documented before the journal submission.\n- The lab would experience technical issues such as software changes and hardware failures.\n- She would have a history of good research practices.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to a narrative that is consistent with innocent behavior and standard research practices.\n\n85"

However, the fact that it's similar to what other students did suggests it might be a lab practice rather than misconduct-specific behavior.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on valid criteria with notes predating journal submission**: This action is legitimate and suggests that the exclusion was not done to manipulate the results post-hoc. If Lena committed misconduct, it's still possible she followed proper exclusion procedures for some participants.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and hardware failure**: These are external factors that could happen regardless of misconduct. A researcher committing misconduct might still be affected by such issues.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data and passing an independent audit**: If Lena committed misconduct in the case at hand, it's plausible she had been careful or lucky enough in her previous work to avoid detection or not to have engaged in misconduct then.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the described behaviors and circumstances could still occur. The actions that are clearly innocent or unrelated to misconduct (like the lab switching software, hardware failure, and having a prior clean record) would likely still happen. Even the act of running multiple scripts could be part of a misconduct strategy or simply a legitimate practice.\n\nThus, the evidence described doesn't necessarily contradict the possibility of misconduct but doesn't strongly support it either, as many of these factors are neutral or can be explained by innocent means.\n\n70"
