    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the evidence, we need to consider the probability of the observed events occurring without misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which is a form of academic misconduct. However, it could also occur by chance or due to other factors. The probability of this happening by chance, without any misconduct, is low because the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis should be uniform.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after seeing the data can be a sign of questionable research practices. If Lena didn't commit misconduct, this could be an honest mistake or miscommunication. However, preregistration is meant to be a safeguard against post-hoc changes that can introduce bias.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be due to various reasons such as changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria based on data inspection, which again raises concerns about research practices.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails show that Lena had a strong desire for the study to succeed, they don't directly imply misconduct. However, they do suggest a motive.\n\nConsidering these points together, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect the data and analysis practices to reflect standard, transparent research practices without the suspicious patterns observed.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially the unusual distribution of p-values and the post-data collection changes to preregistration—being coincidental or due to innocent reasons is quite low. The described patterns are more likely to occur in the presence of some form of research misconduct or at least questionable research practices.\n\nGiven the multiple indicators that suggest potential misconduct or at least sloppy or biased research practices, and considering that these need to occur together without misconduct, the likelihood is very low.\n\nThe observed patterns collectively suggest a low probability of innocence regarding the accusations.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistered plan after seeing the data can be a sign of misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration document could be part of manipulating the study's outcomes.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena committed misconduct, it's possible she selectively excluded participants to achieve the desired results, which aligns with manipulating data or analyses.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: These emails suggest a motive for misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, the pressure and personal stake could have driven her actions.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the probability of observing the described patterns is relatively high because they are consistent with behaviors associated with misconduct, such as manipulating data or analyses to achieve desired outcomes, selectively reporting results, and altering research plans post-hoc.\n\nThe evidence collectively supports a high likelihood of the observed patterns occurring if Lena did commit misconduct.\n\n85"
