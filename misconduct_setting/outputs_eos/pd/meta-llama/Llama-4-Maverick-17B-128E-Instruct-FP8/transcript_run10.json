    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed events if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. However, it could also result from genuine analyses where the effects are real and significant. The probability of this occurring by chance, without misconduct, is low because the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis should be uniform.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency by specifying the analysis plan before seeing the data. Changing the preregistration after data collection could indicate an attempt to make the analysis fit the data, which raises suspicions of misconduct. However, there could be innocent reasons for such changes (e.g., correcting an oversight or updating based on new information not available at preregistration). The likelihood of making changes that just so happen to align with significant results (without misconduct) is lower if the changes were genuinely unrelated to the results.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: Differences between an earlier analysis script and the final dataset could be due to various reasons, including legitimate decisions to exclude participants based on criteria that were decided upon before seeing the final results, or due to errors. The presence of an earlier version with different participants doesn't directly imply misconduct unless the exclusion criteria were decided upon in a way that was influenced by the data (contrary to preregistration or good practice).\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails suggest that Lena had a personal and professional interest in the study's success, they do not directly prove misconduct. However, they do set a context where the temptation to manipulate data might be higher.\n\nGiven these observations, the key question is whether these events are likely to occur together without misconduct. \n\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious and less likely under innocence.\n- The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is also suspicious.\n- The inclusion of additional participants in an earlier analysis script could be innocent or not, depending on the reasons for their exclusion.\n- The emails reveal pressure and motivation but do not directly indicate misconduct.\n\nCombining these factors, while each piece of evidence can be argued to have potential innocent explanations, together they paint a suspicious picture. The probability that all these events occur together without any misconduct is low because some of the observations (like the p-value distribution and the post-hoc changes to preregistration) are not easily explained by innocence.\n\n5"

If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she would ensure that p-values were significant.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: If Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration document post-data collection to align with significant findings or to exclude participants that lead to non-significant results would be a likely action. This action would be consistent with trying to make the study's results appear more significant or supportive of the hypothesis.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants who were later excluded from the final dataset**: If misconduct occurred, it's plausible that these exclusions were made to improve the results. Excluding certain participants could be a way to achieve more significant or desirable outcomes.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: The emails suggest Lena had a strong motivation to succeed, which could drive someone to commit misconduct.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the observed events become more plausible:\n- Manipulating or selectively reporting data (resulting in p-values just below .05) is consistent with misconduct.\n- Changing preregistration details post-data collection to fit the desired outcome is also consistent with misconduct.\n- Excluding participants to achieve a more desirable result aligns with misconduct.\n- The emails provide a motive for such actions.\n\nTherefore, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would see the patterns and behaviors described.\n\n80"

If Lena committed misconduct, she might still run multiple scripts, but the intention behind it would be different.\n\n2. **Excluding participants based on legitimate reasons**: Excluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions is a reasonable practice.

In fact, some (like excluding participants based on pre-existing notes and having a prior clean record) are more indicative of good practice. However, if Lena did commit misconduct, it's still plausible that:\n- She could have run multiple analysis scripts (potentially to find the most favorable outcome).\n- She could have legitimately excluded certain participants.\n- The lab and technical issues could have occurred independently of her actions.\n- Her past record could be genuinely clean.\n\nThe likelihood of these events under the assumption of misconduct isn't necessarily lower than under innocence because many of these actions or events are not directly indicative of misconduct. However, the presence of a clean past record and legitimate exclusions might be less expected if she had a habit of misconduct.\n\n20 is too low because some of these events (like the lab switching software, laptop failure, and legitimate exclusions) are plausible regardless of misconduct.

Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results.\n\nThese factors suggested potential misconduct. However, further investigation revealed:\n1.

Lena has a prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed an independent audit.\n\nThe additional information provides plausible explanations for some of the initial concerns and suggests that not all irregularities are indicative of misconduct. The presence of multiple analysis scripts can be seen as part of good practice, and the exclusion of participants was based on pre-existing notes. The technical issues (software switch and hard drive failure) offer explanations for some discrepancies.\n\nHowever, the concentration of p-values just below .05 and the modification of the preregistration document after data collection remain concerning. While these could be coincidental or due to other factors, they are not fully explained by the additional information.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, we must weigh the likelihood of misconduct against the possibility of innocent explanations. The suspicious patterns (p-value distribution and post-hoc changes to preregistration) are concerning but not definitive proof. Lena's history of good practice and the presence of plausible alternative explanations for some findings complicate the picture.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, a moderate to high probability of misconduct seems reasonable due to the suspicious patterns that are not fully explained by the additional information.\n\n60"
