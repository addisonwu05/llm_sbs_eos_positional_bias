    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the evidence, we need to consider the probability of the observed events under the assumption that she is innocent (i.e., did not intentionally manipulate or fabricate data).\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena did not manipulate the data, it's unlikely to see such a concentration of p-values just below .05 by chance, as one would expect a more uniform distribution around .05 under the null hypothesis. However, this alone isn't conclusive evidence of misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is meant to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency. Modifying it after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is highly suspicious and suggests potential misconduct, as it could be used to make the results appear more significant than they are.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could be due to various reasons, including legitimate changes in the analysis plan based on unforeseen issues with some participants' data. However, without a clear justification, it raises suspicions.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While these emails show that Lena had a motive to manipulate the data or was under pressure to produce certain results, they do not directly imply misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her data and analysis practices to be transparent, consistent, and free from suspicious patterns that could indicate manipulation. The combination of a suspicious distribution of p-values, modifications to the preregistration after data collection, discrepancies in participant inclusion across analysis versions, and personal emails indicating a high stake in the study's success is highly unlikely to occur together by chance if she were innocent.\n\nHowever, assessing the exact probability requires weighing the likelihood of these events occurring innocently. Some factors, like the suspicious distribution of p-values and the modification of the preregistration document, are particularly unusual under the assumption of innocence.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's highly improbable that all these conditions would be met without some form of misconduct.\n\n5"

This behavior is consistent with p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration to align with favorable outcomes or exclusion criteria is a common form of misconduct that can make results appear more significant.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants later excluded**: If Lena was manipulating the data or analysis plan, excluding certain participants post-hoc could be a way to improve the results, making this scenario plausible under misconduct.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a motive**: The emails suggest Lena had a motive and was under pressure, which could drive someone to commit misconduct.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is very plausible that:\n- She would manipulate data or analyses to achieve significant p-values.\n- She would modify the preregistration to justify her findings or exclude inconvenient data.\n- She would exclude certain participants if it helped achieve the desired outcome.\n- Her emails reflect a pressure and motive that could lead to such actions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the combination of these factors is quite likely if Lena committed misconduct.\n\n85"
