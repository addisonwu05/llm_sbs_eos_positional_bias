    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

While this indicates motivation, it doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration after seeing the data can be a sign of questionable research practices, but it could also be due to genuine misunderstandings or the need to correct initial mistakes.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants later excluded**: The exclusion of participants can be legitimate if based on predefined criteria. However, changing or adjusting these criteria after data collection (as indicated by the modification of the preregistration document) can raise suspicions.\n\n4. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, practices that are considered academic misconduct. The absence of p-values just above .05 suggests that some analyses or data points might have been selectively excluded or manipulated.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her to adhere to good research practices, such as preregistering her analyses without later modification based on the data, not selectively excluding participants or analyses to achieve certain results, and not manipulating data to achieve statistical significance.\n\nThe combination of these factors—especially the suspicious pattern of p-values and the post-hoc changes to the preregistration—suggests behavior that is unlikely under the assumption of no academic misconduct. While each factor alone could potentially have an innocent explanation, their combination is more difficult to justify without invoking some form of misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices.\n\nConsidering the cumulative effect of these observations and assuming Lena did not commit academic misconduct, the likelihood of observing all these factors together is low.\n\n5"
