    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To determine the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed circumstances, let's analyze the provided information step by step.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena did not commit misconduct, we would expect a more uniform distribution of p-values around the significance threshold.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analyses. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after data collection could indicate that the changes were made to make the results appear more significant or supportive of the hypothesis than they originally were, suggesting misconduct.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This discrepancy could be due to honest mistakes or methodological adjustments. However, without a clear rationale for the exclusion that is not related to the results, it raises suspicions.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the study's success**: While having a stake in a study's success is common, expressing that \"I need this one to work\" could imply a level of desperation or bias that might lead to corner-cutting or more severe misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is unusual under normal research practices without misconduct.\n- The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is a red flag for potential misconduct.\n- The discrepancy in the analysis script could have innocent explanations but also raises suspicions without clear justification.\n- Lena's expressed pressure and need for the study to succeed could motivate misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect her research practices to be beyond reproach, or any irregularities to have plausible, innocent explanations. The accumulation of these specific irregularities and red flags makes it less likely that all of them are due to innocent causes.\n\nGiven the multiple indicators that suggest potential misconduct or, at the very least, questionable research practices, the probability that Lena did not commit academic misconduct and that all these observations occurred by chance or due to innocent reasons is low.\n\n5"

The p-hacking or data manipulation could explain the unusual distribution of p-values. The post-hoc modification of the preregistration and selective exclusion of participants are consistent with misconduct aimed at achieving significant or favorable results. The emails provide a motive.\n\nThe accumulation of these factors is more likely if Lena committed misconduct because they are either direct results of such actions (e.g., p-values distribution, altering preregistration) or provide a plausible motive (emails).\n\n90"

Running and storing multiple scripts could be seen as an attempt to appear thorough or to explore robustness, but it could also be part of a strategy to selectively report favorable results. However, the fact that it's similar to other students suggests it might be a genuine practice.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants for valid reasons with predating notes**: This action is consistent with proper research practice.

They provide plausible explanations for some irregularities or missing data.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data handling**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, her past record of clean data handling suggests that this might not be a habitual behavior for her, making the misconduct potentially an anomaly rather than a pattern.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the observed evidence includes a mix of factors that are either unrelated to the misconduct (lab software switch, hard drive failure), potentially indicative of good practice or attempts to cover tracks (multiple analysis scripts, valid exclusions), or contradictory to the idea of habitual misconduct (prior clean record).\n\nWhile some of these factors are consistent with or neutral to misconduct, others (like having a prior clean record) might suggest that the misconduct, if it occurred, was not part of a larger pattern of behavior.\n\n40"
