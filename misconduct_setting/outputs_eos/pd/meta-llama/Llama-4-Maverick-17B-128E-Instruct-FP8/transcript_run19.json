    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to consider the probability of the evidence occurring under the assumption of no misconduct. The evidence includes: an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05, modification of the preregistration document after data collection, an earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset, and certain statements made by Lena in emails.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting, which is a form of academic misconduct. However, it could also occur by chance or due to other factors not related to misconduct. The probability of observing this by chance is low, but not impossible.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to ensure transparency and reduce the potential for data manipulation or outcome switching. Modifying it after data collection could be seen as suspicious and might indicate an attempt to make the analysis fit the data. However, it could also be due to genuine oversight or the need for adjustments based on unforeseen issues with the data.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants**: The presence of participants in an earlier analysis script who were later excluded could indicate changes in the analysis plan or data handling practices. While this could raise suspicions, it might also be due to legitimate reasons such as applying exclusion criteria that were not perfectly clear at the outset.\n\n4. **Lena's statements in emails**: Lena's expressions of pressure and the importance of the study's success for her career and her supervisor's grant could indicate a motive for misconduct. However, acknowledging pressure or desire for success is not in itself misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit academic misconduct, we would expect the data and analysis practices to be free from patterns that suggest manipulation. \n\nThe combination of these pieces of evidence (especially the first two) under the assumption of no misconduct is unlikely because they all suggest some form of manipulation or at least raise significant suspicions. \n\nThe key here is understanding that some of these elements could occur without misconduct but together they paint a concerning picture.\n\n5\n\nThis is an extremely low probability, indicating that if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it would be highly unlikely to observe the combination of evidence described.\n\n0"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of the observed evidence if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's break down the key elements of the evidence and relate them to potential misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This is a classic sign of p-hacking or selective reporting, both of which are forms of academic misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she might manipulate data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing exclusion criteria or primary outcomes after seeing the data can be a form of outcome switching or data manipulation, which is considered misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, modifying the preregistration document to fit the data she had would be a likely action.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants who were later excluded**: Excluding participants post-hoc can be a legitimate practice if done according to pre-specified criteria. However, if those exclusions are done in a way that manipulates the results, it constitutes misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, she might exclude participants to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n4. **Lena's statements in emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: These statements suggest a motive for misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, it's likely she was under pressure and felt a strong need for the study to succeed, which aligns with her statements.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, the observed evidence becomes more plausible:\n- The high concentration of p-values just below .05 could be due to p-hacking or data manipulation.\n- The modification of the preregistration document could be an attempt to justify the analyses post-hoc.\n- The exclusion of participants from the earlier analysis script could be part of manipulating the data to achieve the desired results.\n- Lena's statements suggest she had a motive to manipulate the results.\n\nThus, if Lena did commit academic misconduct, it is quite likely that we would observe the patterns and evidence described.\n\n80"

The fact that other students in the lab show similar patterns supports this interpretation.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on notes predating journal submission**: Excluding participants based on valid reasons (like falling asleep or not understanding instructions) and having documentation that predates the journal submission suggests that the exclusions were not done to manipulate the results for publication.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are plausible explanations for some of the irregularities observed, such as file loss or changes in analysis scripts.

However, showing multiple scripts similar to other students could be a way to create a veneer of legitimacy or to actually explore robustness genuinely. This action alone doesn't directly indicate misconduct.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants with valid reasons and documentation predating journal submission**: This is a legitimate practice and doesn't directly suggest misconduct. If Lena committed misconduct, she might still exclude participants for valid reasons, as this doesn't necessarily imply manipulation.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are events outside of Lena's control and can happen regardless of whether she committed misconduct. They provide plausible explanations for some discrepancies or file handling issues.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's possible she had been careful or lucky in her previous studies, or that she hadn't been under similar pressure before.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, the likelihood of observing the specific evidence mentioned is not directly influenced by the misconduct in a straightforward manner. The evidence mentioned (running multiple scripts, valid exclusions, lab software switch, hard drive failure, and a clean prior record) is not necessarily indicative of misconduct and could occur regardless of whether misconduct occurred. Some elements (like having a clean prior record) might even be seen as less likely if she had a history of misconduct, but the absence of past misconduct doesn't directly inform the likelihood of current misconduct.\n\nThe fact that some of these elements (like running multiple analysis scripts) are common practices and others (like the lab switching software and hard drive failure) are external factors, means that observing these wouldn't be particularly surprising or unlikely even if Lena did commit misconduct.\n\nHowever, the fact that the exclusions were based on valid reasons and predated the journal submission, and that she had a clean prior record, might be considered less likely if she was willing to engage in misconduct, as it suggests some level of adherence to proper practices.\n\n20"
