    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed circumstances, we need to examine the probability of these events occurring innocently.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of p-hacking or selective reporting. However, it could also occur by chance, although the probability decreases as the number of analyses showing this pattern increases. The occurrence of this pattern across several analyses is less likely to be coincidental.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency. Changing the preregistration document after data collection to fit the results could indicate an attempt to make the analysis post-hoc appear as if it were planned. An innocent explanation could involve genuine mistakes or misunderstandings about the process, but this is less likely given the clear implications of such actions.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: Excluding participants can be legitimate if based on predefined criteria. However, doing so in a way that isn't transparent or justified could indicate manipulation. There could be innocent reasons for excluding participants (e.g., failure to meet inclusion criteria, technical issues), but the fact that an earlier version of the script included them suggests potential selective exclusion.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While this doesn't directly imply misconduct, it suggests a motive. Researchers often have stakes in their studies, but this doesn't necessarily lead to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, while it's possible that all these events could occur without misconduct (e.g., due to a combination of honest mistakes, sloppiness, or unforeseen circumstances), the cumulative probability of all these specific events happening innocently is low.\n\nThe presence of multiple indicators that collectively suggest questionable research practices or potential misconduct (even if not definitively proven) makes it improbable that all observed issues are innocent.\n\nGiven these observations, it is highly unlikely (though not impossible) that all these events would occur without any misconduct.\n\n5"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that the observed evidence would occur if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's consider the implications of such misconduct on the evidence presented:\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena committed misconduct, this could involve p-hacking or manipulation of data/analyses to achieve statistically significant results. This behavior would directly lead to an unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Misconduct could involve altering the preregistration to match the actual analyses performed or to justify the exclusion criteria and primary outcomes that were decided upon after seeing the data. This action is consistent with an attempt to conceal or justify post-hoc decisions.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, she might selectively exclude participants to achieve desired results or to remove outliers that don't fit the hypothesis. The existence of an earlier script with more participants suggests that some were excluded, which could be part of the misconduct.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure and a personal stake in the results**: While not direct evidence of misconduct, these emails suggest a motive. Researchers under pressure might be more inclined to engage in misconduct to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nIf Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly plausible that:\n- She would manipulate analyses to achieve significant p-values.\n- She would alter the preregistration document to fit her actions post-hoc.\n- She might exclude certain participants to achieve the desired outcome, which would be reflected in differences between earlier and later analysis scripts.\n\nThe observed evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of misconduct, as it suggests potential manipulation of data/analyses and a motive for doing so.\n\n90"

If Lena was following lab practices and exploring different exclusion criteria as part of her analyses, this behavior is expected and innocent.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a reasonable and justifiable practice. The fact that the notes predate the journal submission supports the legitimacy of these exclusions.\n\n3. **Lab switching statistical software and Lena's laptop hard drive failure**: These are plausible events that could happen in any research setting. They provide a potential innocent explanation for some of the irregularities or missing files observed.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean and well-documented data**: This history supports the notion that Lena is capable of handling data properly and suggests that any issues in the current study might not be due to intentional misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would run multiple analyses as part of exploring robustness, similar to her peers.\n- She would exclude participants based on valid reasons documented before the journal submission.\n- The lab would experience technical issues such as software changes and hardware failures.\n\nThese factors collectively paint a picture that is consistent with innocent practices and events.\n\n80"

However, if Lena committed misconduct, it's plausible she would still run multiple scripts, either as a genuine practice or to create a veneer of legitimacy.\n\n2. **Excluding participants for valid reasons with pre-existing notes**: This action is justifiable and not necessarily indicative of misconduct. Even if Lena committed misconduct elsewhere, excluding participants for valid, documented reasons doesn't directly imply misconduct.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are events that could happen regardless of Lena's actions.

The actions described (running multiple scripts, excluding participants for valid reasons, lab and technical issues, and her past record) are either neutral or could be seen as part of normal or justifiable research practices.\n\nTherefore, these factors don't strongly indicate or rule out misconduct directly but suggest that even if misconduct occurred, these aspects could still happen for innocent or unrelated reasons.\n\n70"
