    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the evidence, we need to consider how plausible it is for the observed phenomena to occur without misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern can be indicative of \"p-hacking,\" a form of research misconduct where data analysis is manipulated to yield statistically significant results. However, it could also occur by chance or due to genuine effects being tested. The probability of this happening naturally across multiple analyses without any manipulation is low, as one would expect a more uniform distribution around .05 if the true effects were near zero or if analyses were conducted without bias towards significance.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Preregistration is a method to increase research transparency by specifying analysis plans before data is collected. Changing the preregistration after data collection can indicate an attempt to align the planned analyses with the results obtained, potentially making non-significant results significant. While there could be innocent reasons for such changes (e.g., correcting errors), doing so after data collection is viewed with skepticism.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants not in the final dataset**: This could be an innocent occurrence if the initial inclusion criteria were later refined based on a valid methodological reason. However, unexplained exclusions can also be a red flag.\n\n4. **Lena's emails indicating pressure to produce a certain result**: While her statements show she felt pressure and had a vested interest in the outcome, they don't directly imply misconduct.\n\nTo assess the probability that Lena did not commit misconduct given these observations, we consider how likely these events are to co-occur without misconduct.\n\n- The concentration of p-values just below .05 is suspicious.\n- The modification of the preregistration document after data collection is suspicious.\n- The inclusion of additional participants in an earlier analysis script could be innocent but is suspicious if not explained.\n- Lena's expressed pressure and desire for the study to \"work\" indicate motivation but don't directly imply misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors, particularly the suspicious patterns in the data and analysis (p-value distribution and preregistration changes), makes it unlikely that all these observations occurred without any misconduct.\n\nGiven the evidence, it is improbable that all these events would naturally occur together without some form of academic misconduct.\n\n5"

    "content": "To evaluate the likelihood that the described events would occur if Lena committed academic misconduct, let's examine each piece of evidence in the context of misconduct.\n\n1. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena committed misconduct, such as p-hacking or selective reporting, it's highly plausible that she would end up with a distribution of p-values that clusters just below .05. Misconduct could involve manipulating analyses to achieve significant results, leading to this pattern.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes**: Changing the preregistration after seeing the data is a form of misconduct that can make non-significant results appear significant. If Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration to fit the data she obtained is a plausible action.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including participants later excluded from the final dataset**: If Lena engaged in misconduct, she might have excluded participants in a way that was not pre-specified to improve the results. This could involve excluding participants to make the results more significant.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to \"work\"**: While these emails show motivation and pressure, they don't directly imply misconduct. However, they provide context suggesting that Lena had a strong interest in obtaining certain results, which could motivate misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed academic misconduct:\n\n- It's plausible she would manipulate analyses to get significant p-values, resulting in the observed distribution.\n- She might modify the preregistration to align with the analyses that yielded significant results.\n- She could exclude participants in a non-pre-specified manner to improve the results.\n- Her emails show she had a motivation to do so.\n\nThus, if Lena committed misconduct, it's quite likely that we would observe the patterns and evidence described.\n\n90"

The fact that other students show similar patterns supports this, suggesting a lab-wide practice.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on notes predating journal submission**: This is a reasonable and transparent practice. Excluding participants who didn't understand the task or fell asleep is justified, and doing so based on notes that predate the journal submission indicates that the decision wasn't made post-hoc to manipulate results.\n\n3. **Lab switching software mid-project and Lena's laptop suffering a hard drive failure**: These are unfortunate but plausible events. Labs often change software or tools as new versions or alternatives become available. A hardware failure is also an unfortunate but possible occurrence.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean, well-documented data**: This suggests a history of good research practice, making it more plausible that any issues in the current study are not due to misconduct.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it's quite plausible that we would observe these events. The behaviors and circumstances described are consistent with good or at least innocent research practices. The presence of multiple analysis scripts and the exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes are practices that could occur without misconduct, especially in the context of a lab that apparently values robustness checks. The hardware failure and software switch are external events that could happen to any researcher.\n\n80"

However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this could be a standard lab practice. A researcher committing misconduct might still engage in this practice, as it could be part of their usual workflow or an attempt to justify their eventual choice of analysis.\n\n2. **Exclusion of participants based on pre-existing notes**: This is a legitimate practice and doesn't directly relate to misconduct. Even if Lena committed misconduct elsewhere, excluding participants for valid reasons (like not understanding instructions or falling asleep) based on pre-existing notes doesn't necessarily indicate misconduct in this specific instance.\n\n3. **Lab switching software and laptop hard drive failure**: These are external events unrelated to Lena's behavior or misconduct. The likelihood of these occurring doesn't depend on whether Lena committed misconduct.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean data**: If Lena committed misconduct in the current study, it's plausible she had a prior clean record. Misconduct can be a one-time occurrence, and past behavior doesn't guarantee future actions.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena committed academic misconduct, the described events are still plausible. The presence of multiple analysis scripts could be part of her process, even if she eventually manipulated results. The exclusion of participants and the lab and laptop issues are unrelated to her potential misconduct, and a prior clean record is consistent with misconduct being a one-time lapse.\n\nThus, the likelihood of observing these events if Lena committed misconduct is relatively high because many of these factors are either unrelated to misconduct or could coexist with it.\n\n75"
