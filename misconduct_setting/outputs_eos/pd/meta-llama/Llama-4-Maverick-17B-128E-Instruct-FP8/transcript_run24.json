    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To determine the likelihood that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the observed evidence, we need to analyze each piece of evidence and its implications.\n\n1. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: Lena's emails to her friend suggest she felt pressure to produce significant results due to the potential impact on her career and her supervisor's grant. While this indicates motivation, it doesn't directly imply misconduct. However, it sets a context where the desire for positive results could potentially lead to questionable practices.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: Changing the preregistration document after data collection to alter exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a significant deviation from best practices. Preregistration is meant to prevent p-hacking and ensure transparency. Modifying it post-hoc suggests that the changes might have been made to achieve significant results. If Lena did not commit misconduct, this could be an honest mistake, but it's a serious one.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants later excluded**: The fact that earlier versions of the analysis script included more participants who were later excluded could suggest that the exclusion criteria were adjusted post-hoc to fit the desired outcome. This, combined with the modification of the preregistration document, raises concerns about data handling and analysis decisions being driven by the results.\n\n4. **Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05**: This pattern is often associated with p-hacking or selective reporting, where analyses are adjusted or reported in a way that maximizes the number of statistically significant results.\n\nTo assess the likelihood that Lena did not commit misconduct given these observations, we consider the alternative explanations for these findings:\n- The patterns in p-values could be due to chance or genuine effects.\n- The changes in preregistration and analysis scripts could be due to honest mistakes or miscommunication.\n- The emails reflect pressure but not necessarily an intention to cheat.\n\nHowever, the accumulation of these factors (especially the suspicious patterns in p-values and the alterations to the preregistration and analysis scripts) makes it increasingly unlikely that all these observations are due to innocent causes.\n\nThe probability that Lena did not commit academic misconduct given the evidence is quite low due to the combination of suspicious circumstances.\n\n5"

    "content": "To assess the likelihood of observing the given evidence if Lena did commit academic misconduct, let's analyze the evidence in the context of misconduct.\n\n1. **High concentration of p-values just below .05**: If Lena committed misconduct, such as p-hacking or selective reporting, it would be expected that the final dataset shows a suspiciously high number of p-values just below the .05 threshold. This is because one of the goals of such misconduct is to achieve statistically significant results.\n\n2. **Modification of the preregistration document after data collection**: If Lena committed misconduct, altering the preregistration document post-hoc to fit the obtained results would be a plausible action to avoid detection of p-hacking or to justify the results she wanted.\n\n3. **Earlier analysis script including additional participants later excluded**: If Lena was engaging in misconduct, excluding certain participants or data points to achieve desired results or to remove outliers that didn't fit the hypothesis would be consistent with such behavior.\n\n4. **Emails indicating pressure and a desire for the study to succeed**: These emails show that Lena had a motive to manipulate the results, as she felt her career and her supervisor's grant were at stake.\n\nGiven that Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly plausible that:\n- She would manipulate or selectively report analyses to achieve significant p-values, explaining the unusual distribution of p-values.\n- She would modify the preregistration document to justify her actions or to avoid detection.\n- She would adjust the dataset (e.g., by excluding certain participants) to fit her desired outcomes.\n\nTherefore, if Lena committed academic misconduct, it is highly likely that we would observe the patterns and evidence described.\n\n90"

The fact that other students show similar patterns supports this interpretation.\n\n2. **Exclusion of two participants based on pre-existing notes**: Excluding participants who reported falling asleep or not understanding instructions is a reasonable practice if the notes were made before any potential bias from knowing the results.

They provide a mundane explanation for some of the irregularities or missing files.\n\n4. **Lena's prior record of clean and well-documented data**: This history suggests that Lena is capable of handling data responsibly and that her past work has been considered reliable.\n\nConsidering these points, if Lena did not commit academic misconduct, it is quite plausible that:\n- She would explore multiple analysis scripts as part of good practice, aligning with lab-wide efforts.\n- She would exclude participants based on legitimate reasons that were documented before any potential influence from the results.\n- The lab would experience technical issues like software changes and hardware failures, which are common in research environments.\n- Her past data handling would be clean and well-documented, as evidenced by passing an independent audit.\n\nTherefore, given that Lena did not commit misconduct, it is fairly likely that we would observe these pieces of evidence.\n\n80"
