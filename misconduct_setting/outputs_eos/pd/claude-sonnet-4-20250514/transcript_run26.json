    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several analyses\n2. Preregistration modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and outcomes\n3. Earlier analysis script showing additional participants later excluded\n4. Emails expressing pressure and need for positive results\n\nIf no misconduct occurred, each piece of evidence would need an innocent explanation:\n\nThe p-value distribution is particularly damning - having multiple analyses cluster just below .05 with virtually none just above is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nThe post-hoc modification of preregistration after seeing the data directly violates research integrity principles, even if not technically \"misconduct\" in Lena's mind.\n\nThe exclusion of participants from earlier versions could have legitimate reasons, but combined with the other evidence suggests selective reporting.\n\nThe emails, while showing motive rather than action, demonstrate the psychological pressure that often precedes research misconduct.\n\nWhile individual pieces might have innocent explanations, the combination of all these red flags occurring together in one study is extremely improbable if conducted with complete integrity. The statistical pattern alone is nearly impossible to achieve through honest means across multiple analyses.\n\n15"
