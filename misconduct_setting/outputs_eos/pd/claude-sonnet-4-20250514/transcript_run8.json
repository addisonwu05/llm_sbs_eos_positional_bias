    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

In legitimate research, p-values should be more uniformly distributed around the significance threshold. This pattern strongly suggests selective reporting or data manipulation.\n\nThe modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious red flag. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent post-hoc changes that capitalize on chance findings. Legitimate modifications after data collection are extremely rare and would require compelling methodological justifications.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were excluded from the final dataset could have innocent explanations (quality control, meeting inclusion criteria), but combined with the modified preregistration, it suggests the exclusions may have been driven by their impact on results rather than legitimate methodological reasons.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" demonstrate motive and pressure, but by themselves don't prove misconduct - many researchers face similar pressures and express similar concerns without engaging in fraud.\n\nHowever, when all four pieces of evidence are considered together, they form a highly coherent pattern that would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance if no misconduct took place. The statistical anomalies combined with the procedural irregularities and documented pressure create a confluence of evidence that would be very improbable under honest research practices.\n\n15"

This is a classic hallmark of research fraud - the \"too good to be true\" statistical pattern that results from selective data manipulation.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a common form of misconduct known as \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known). If someone is fabricating or manipulating results, they would very likely need to adjust their preregistered plans to match their manufactured findings.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of post-hoc data manipulation. Someone committing misconduct would likely try different combinations of participants and exclusions until they achieved the desired statistical results.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" provide clear motive for misconduct. While not all researchers under pressure commit fraud, these statements show the psychological state that typically precedes research misconduct - desperation and strong motivation to produce positive results regardless of what the data actually show.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are highly consistent with and would be very likely consequences of deliberate academic misconduct. Each element supports and reinforces the others in a pattern that would be expected if someone systematically manipulated their research to produce falsely positive results.\n\n92"
