    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

The statistical evidence in particular - the p-value clustering - is extremely difficult to explain through normal research processes, as genuine effects typically produce more varied p-value distributions.\n\nThe probability that all four of these concerning patterns would occur together in the absence of misconduct is very low.\n\n15"

Graduate students facing such pressures are at higher risk for research integrity violations.\n\nThe p-value clustering just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several analyses is a classic signature of data manipulation or p-hacking. If someone were fabricating or falsifying data, this pattern would be highly expected as they would aim for \"significant\" results.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes would be very likely if someone were trying to make their analyses appear more legitimate post-hoc. This is a common form of research misconduct.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of data manipulation - trying different combinations of participants until finding a dataset that produces the desired results, then excluding inconvenient data points.\n\nAll four pieces of evidence are not only consistent with academic misconduct, but are actually textbook examples of the types of behaviors and statistical patterns that research integrity investigations specifically look for. The combination creates a coherent narrative of someone under pressure who engaged in data manipulation to achieve publishable results.\n\n92"

While people can change their behavior under pressure, research integrity violations often show patterns over time. Someone who previously demonstrated meticulous data handling and passed audits would be somewhat less likely to suddenly engage in fabrication or falsification.\n\nThe first three pieces of evidence are quite compatible with misconduct, but the clean audit history provides some contradiction to a misconduct scenario, though pressure and career stakes could potentially explain a departure from previous ethical behavior.\n\n68"
