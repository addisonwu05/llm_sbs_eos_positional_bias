    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Legitimate researchers occasionally make post-hoc changes but would typically acknowledge them transparently rather than silently modifying the preregistration.\n\nThe earlier analysis script with different participants could have innocent explanations - quality control processes, discovery of protocol violations, or legitimate data cleaning decisions made during analysis.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above is statistically very unusual if occurring naturally. While possible through selective reporting of exploratory analyses or analytical flexibility, this pattern is a strong indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\nThe email comments about pressure, while showing concerning motivations, are relatively common expressions of academic stress and career anxiety. Many graduate students express similar sentiments without committing misconduct.\n\nThe combination of the preregistration modification and the suspicious p-value distribution together creates a pattern that would be quite unlikely to occur innocently. While individual pieces might have mundane explanations, their co-occurrence significantly reduces the probability of an innocent explanation.\n\n25"

The preregistration changes and p-value patterns are nearly inevitable outcomes of data manipulation, while the excluded participants and pressure emails fit perfectly with the typical misconduct scenario.\n\n92"

Having other students show similar patterns provides perfect cover for illegitimate data manipulation.\n\nTwo participants excluded for legitimate reasons with pre-existing notes would be moderately likely. Even researchers engaging in misconduct often have some genuinely valid exclusions mixed in with questionable ones. The legitimate exclusions don't preclude additional inappropriate manipulations.\n\nThe software switch and confirmed hardware failure would be moderately likely - these are common enough occurrences that someone committing misconduct could easily experience them coincidentally. The timing might even be convenient for obscuring evidence trails.\n\nA prior record of clean, well-documented research would be somewhat likely. Many cases of research misconduct involve researchers with previously good records who face unprecedented pressure or circumstances. Career desperation can drive previously ethical researchers to cross lines they never crossed before.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, these mitigating factors could still plausibly co-occur. The lab practices provide cover, some legitimate exclusions are normal, technical issues happen regardless of intent, and good past behavior doesn't prevent future misconduct under extreme pressure.\n\n65"
