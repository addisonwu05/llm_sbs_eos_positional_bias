    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern is a classic red flag for p-hacking or selective reporting, as genuine results would show a more uniform distribution around the 0.05 threshold.\n\nThe modification of preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of scientific protocol. While technical errors could explain some documentation issues, deliberately changing preregistration after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the scientific process and would be very unlikely to happen innocently.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were excluded from the final dataset could have innocent explanations (quality control, protocol violations, etc.), but combined with the other evidence, it suggests potential selective exclusion to improve results.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and that she \"needs this one to work\" show concerning motivation and mindset, though by themselves don't prove misconduct.\n\nWhen considered together, this combination of evidence - particularly the suspicious p-value distribution and post-hoc preregistration changes - would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur if no misconduct took place. The probability that all these red flags would align coincidentally while maintaining scientific integrity is extremely low.\n\n5"

This pattern is a hallmark of research misconduct where results are artificially pushed below the significance threshold.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a common form of misconduct that allows researchers to retroactively justify their analytical choices and make their results appear more legitimate and planned.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded from the final dataset fits perfectly with selective data exclusion - a form of misconduct where researchers remove inconvenient data points that weaken their desired results.\n\nThe emails expressing intense pressure that she \"needs this one to work\" and concerns about career consequences provide strong motivation for misconduct. These statements demonstrate the psychological pressure that often drives researchers to engage in questionable or fraudulent practices.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not only consistent with academic misconduct, but are actually typical indicators that investigators look for when misconduct has occurred. The p-value manipulation, post-hoc preregistration changes, selective data exclusion, and documented motivation form a coherent pattern that would be highly expected if misconduct took place.\n\n95"

This is exactly what responsible researchers should do, and the contemporaneous documentation supports legitimate exclusions.\n\nA lab switching statistical software mid-project and experiencing hardware failures with confirmed IT records are mundane technical issues that occur regularly in research environments. These have straightforward explanations unrelated to misconduct.\n\nHaving no prior record of irregularities and passing an independent audit the previous year with well-documented, reproducible data strongly supports a pattern of research integrity. Past behavior is often predictive of future conduct.\n\nRunning multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness exploration, with similar patterns among other students, indicates this was standard lab practice rather than individual misconduct. This suggests a systematic approach to sensitivity analysis rather than p-hacking.\n\nAll of these elements - legitimate participant exclusions with proper documentation, routine technical issues with verification, a clean prior record, and participation in standard lab practices - would be very likely to occur in the normal course of ethical research conduct. These factors provide reasonable alternative explanations for what initially appeared suspicious and are consistent with standard research practices.\n\n85"

The fact that other students had similar patterns could provide plausible deniability.\n\nExcluding participants who fell asleep or didn't understand instructions with predating notes represents legitimate exclusions that any researcher, including one committing misconduct, would make. These exclusions don't contradict misconduct - someone could exclude obviously problematic participants while still manipulating other aspects of the data or analysis.\n\nLab software switches and hardware failures are common occurrences that happen regardless of researcher conduct. These technical issues could actually be convenient for someone committing misconduct as they provide explanations for missing files or inconsistencies.\n\nHaving a clean prior record is actually quite common among researchers who later commit misconduct. Career pressure, increased stakes, and specific circumstances often drive previously ethical researchers to engage in misconduct for the first time. The pressure described in her emails suggests this study had unusually high stakes compared to her earlier work.\n\nAll of these factors could easily coexist with misconduct. The legitimate exclusions, technical problems, standard lab practices, and clean history don't prevent or contradict fraudulent behavior - they could actually provide cover for it while the researcher responds to unprecedented pressure.\n\n75"
