    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

Earlier analysis script with additional participants later excluded\n4. Preregistration modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and outcomes\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, each piece of evidence would need an innocent explanation:\n\n- The emails could reflect normal academic pressure and poor word choice\n- The p-value distribution could be due to selective reporting or p-hacking rather than fabrication\n- Participant exclusions could have legitimate methodological reasons\n- The preregistration changes could be honest mistakes or documentation errors\n\nHowever, the combination of all these factors together is highly suspicious. The p-value clustering pattern is particularly damaging evidence, as it's extremely unlikely to occur naturally across multiple analyses. When combined with the pressure-revealing emails and the procedural irregularities (modified preregistration, excluded participants), this creates a coherent pattern that strongly suggests intentional manipulation.\n\nWhile individual pieces might have innocent explanations, the probability that all of these suspicious elements would co-occur without misconduct is very low.\n\n15"

The emails expressing pressure and need for results to \"work\" would be very expected - they establish clear motive for misconduct\n\n2. The unusual concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above would be highly likely - this is a classic signature of data manipulation, as someone fabricating results would naturally aim for \"significant\" p-values while avoiding the suspicious exactly 0.05 threshold\n\n3. Modifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and outcomes would be very likely - this allows post-hoc justification for data manipulation decisions\n\n4. Having an earlier analysis script with additional participants who were later excluded would be highly expected - this represents the natural process of manipulating the dataset by removing inconvenient data points that didn't support the desired outcome\n\n5. The excluded participants would very likely be those whose data made the results less favorable to the hypothesis\n\nAll of these elements form a coherent pattern that would be highly expected if misconduct occurred. The evidence aligns almost perfectly with typical patterns seen in research fraud cases - motive, opportunity, suspicious statistical patterns, and procedural irregularities that favor the desired outcome.\n\n92"
