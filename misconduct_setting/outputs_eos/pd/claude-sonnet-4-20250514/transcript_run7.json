    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\n1. **Earlier script with additional participants**: This is actually quite common in research - participants are routinely excluded for legitimate reasons like technical failures, not meeting inclusion criteria, or protocol violations. This alone is not suspicious.\n\n2. **High concentration of p-values just below 0.05**: This pattern is highly unusual in legitimate research. P-values should be roughly uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, and clustering just below significance thresholds is a classic sign of p-hacking or data manipulation. While possible through chance, it's statistically very unlikely across multiple analyses.\n\n3. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: This is a serious violation of research integrity standards even if done innocently. Preregistrations exist specifically to prevent post-hoc changes that could bias results. Modifying exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data, even if unintentional, fundamentally undermines the scientific process.\n\n4. **Emails about pressure and needing results**: While researchers often face pressure and express concerns privately, the specific phrasing \"I need this one to work\" combined with the other evidence suggests possible motivation for misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors - particularly the suspicious p-value distribution and post-hoc preregistration changes - would be extremely unlikely to occur together in legitimate research, even under significant pressure.\n\n15"

The IT department confirmation provides independent verification of the hardware failure, making this very plausible.\n\n3. **Multiple analysis scripts as part of lab-wide robustness testing**: This is actually good research practice - testing robustness with different exclusion criteria is encouraged.

However, the key would be which scripts she ultimately chose to report - misconduct could involve selectively using the most favorable legitimate analyses.\n\n2. **Two participants excluded for legitimate reasons with pre-submission notes**: Even someone committing misconduct would likely exclude participants for genuinely valid reasons when they exist. These exclusions appear completely legitimate and wouldn't conflict with other forms of data manipulation.\n\n3. **Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure**: These technical issues are independent events that could easily occur regardless of misconduct. Hardware failures and software transitions happen routinely. Someone committing misconduct might even see missing files as convenient cover.\n\n4. **Clean prior record with independent audit**: This is more challenging to reconcile with misconduct. However, academic misconduct often emerges under specific pressures - someone could have a clean history but engage in misconduct when facing career-threatening circumstances for the first time.\n\nWhile the clean prior record and legitimate exclusions somewhat reduce the likelihood, most of these factors could reasonably co-exist with misconduct, especially given the intense pressure described.\n\n65"
