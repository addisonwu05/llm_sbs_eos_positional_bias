    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\nThe modified preregistration after data collection is highly suspicious and very difficult to explain innocently. Legitimate preregistration modifications should occur before seeing results, and changing exclusion criteria post-hoc is a serious methodological violation even if unintentional.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation. While some clustering below 0.05 can happen by chance, the described pattern across multiple analyses is extremely improbable without selective reporting or manipulation.\n\nThe excluded participants from earlier analysis scripts could have innocent explanations (data quality issues, protocol violations, technical problems), but combined with the other evidence, this becomes more concerning.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and need for positive results, while showing clear motivation and awareness of consequences, don't necessarily prove misconduct - many researchers face similar pressures and express such concerns without fabricating data.\n\nHowever, the combination of the preregistration modifications, the highly suspicious p-value distribution, and the participant exclusions creates a pattern that would be extremely unlikely to occur innocently. The preregistration changes alone represent a serious deviation from proper research practice that's very hard to explain as an honest mistake.\n\nThe probability that all these elements would occur together without intentional misconduct is very low.\n\n15"

Someone engaging in misconduct would specifically target getting results below the significance threshold while avoiding the \"failure\" of results just above 0.05.\n\nModifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a direct method of misconduct - retrofitting the planned analysis to match what actually produced significant results. This would be a very likely step for someone trying to make their results appear pre-planned and legitimate.\n\nHaving earlier analysis scripts with additional participants who were later excluded fits perfectly with a pattern of trying different approaches until finding one that works. The exclusion of participants could be part of iterative analysis until achieving desired results.\n\nThe emails expressing that the supervisor was counting on the study, that null results would hurt career prospects, and that she \"needs this one to work\" establish both clear motive and awareness of the stakes. While not proof of misconduct alone, these demonstrate exactly the kind of pressure that leads to research fraud.\n\nAll of these elements together form a coherent pattern that would be very likely to emerge if someone was deliberately manipulating their research to produce publishable positive results.\n\n92"

Such exclusions are common and expected in cognitive studies, and the pre-submission documentation supports legitimacy.\n\nThe confirmed hardware failure and software switch provide plausible explanations for missing files and inconsistencies that might otherwise appear suspicious. IT department confirmation of the hardware issue adds credibility to these technical explanations.\n\nHer clean prior record with well-documented data that passed independent audit strongly supports a pattern of proper research conduct. Researchers don't typically shift from exemplary practices to serious misconduct without warning signs.\n\nThe lab-wide pattern of running multiple analysis scripts to explore robustness normalizes what could otherwise appear suspicious. If other students show similar analytical patterns as part of standard lab practice, this reduces the likelihood that Lena's multiple scripts indicate misconduct.\n\nThese elements collectively provide reasonable innocent explanations for many of the concerning patterns. The legitimate participant exclusions, technical problems causing file issues, strong prior record, and normal lab practices for robustness checking all align well with a scenario where irregularities resulted from standard research challenges rather than intentional fraud.\n\nThis evidence significantly strengthens the case for innocent explanations of the suspicious patterns.\n\n75"

Someone committing misconduct would benefit from having legitimate-appearing reasons to run multiple analyses and choose the most favorable results.\n\nThe two participants excluded for falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with pre-submission notes, represents standard practice that would occur regardless of misconduct.

Academic fraud often emerges under specific pressures (like grant deadlines or career stakes) even among previously honest researchers. The pressure described in Lena's emails represents exactly the kind of circumstances that can lead to first-time misconduct.\n\nThese mitigating factors provide plausible cover and don't necessarily contradict misconduct - they could coexist with manipulated analyses.
