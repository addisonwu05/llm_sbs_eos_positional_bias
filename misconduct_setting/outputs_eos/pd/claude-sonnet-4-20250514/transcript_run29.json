    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This is a classic signature of research misconduct where results are artificially pushed into the \"significant\" range.\n\nModifying the preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a common form of research misconduct that allows researchers to retroactively justify their analytical choices and present exploratory analyses as confirmatory.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded, combined with the post-hoc preregistration changes, strongly suggests selective data inclusion/exclusion to achieve desired results - a hallmark of data manipulation.\n\nThe emails expressing intense pressure and that she \"needs this one to work\" provide clear motivation for misconduct and align perfectly with someone who might resort to data manipulation when facing career pressures.\n\nAll of these elements together form an extremely coherent pattern consistent with research misconduct. Each piece of evidence not only fits with intentional wrongdoing but represents textbook examples of how academic misconduct typically manifests. The combination of statistical anomalies, procedural irregularities, and documented motivation creates a nearly perfect profile of research fraud.\n\n95"

However, this evidence actually works against the misconduct hypothesis since it shows her behavior was consistent with lab norms.\n\nTwo participants excluded for legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with notes predating submission would be very likely even if misconduct occurred, as researchers typically do have some legitimate exclusions alongside any improper ones.\n\nThe lab switching software mid-project and confirmed hardware failure would be coincidental timing if misconduct occurred. While possible, having such convenient technical explanations available when committing fraud would be quite fortunate for covering tracks.\n\nHaving a prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit is somewhat inconsistent with someone who would commit misconduct, though people can change behavior under pressure.\n\nThe combination of all these factors - especially the documented technical issues providing convenient explanations, the pattern matching other students, and the strong prior track record - would be quite coincidental if misconduct actually occurred.
