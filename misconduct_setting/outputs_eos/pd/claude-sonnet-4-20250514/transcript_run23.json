    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally.\n\n2. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: Modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious violation of research integrity practices. While honest mistakes in documentation can happen, changing these key elements after seeing the data strongly suggests intentional manipulation.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions**: Having earlier analysis scripts with participants who were later excluded could potentially have innocent explanations (data quality issues, protocol violations), but combined with the other evidence, it suggests selective exclusion to achieve desired results.\n\n4. **Pressure communications**: While expressing career pressure and hope for positive results is normal, the specific phrasing \"I need this one to work\" in the context of the other evidence suggests possible motivation for misconduct.\n\nIf Lena were innocent, we would need:\n- The suspicious p-value distribution to be a remarkable coincidence\n- The preregistration changes to be honest documentation errors\n- The participant exclusions to be legitimate and properly justified\n- The pressure she felt to not have influenced her data handling\n\nThe combination of all these factors occurring together without misconduct would be extraordinarily unlikely. The p-hacking pattern alone is a very strong statistical indicator of manipulation.\n\n15"

This is the classic signature of someone manipulating analyses until they get the desired statistical significance.\n\n2. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: If committing misconduct, changing preregistration documents after data collection to make the analyses appear planned rather than exploratory is exactly what someone would do to cover their tracks and make the results appear more legitimate.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions**: If manipulating data, selectively excluding participants who don't support the hypothesis while keeping those who do is a common form of data manipulation. The existence of earlier scripts with more participants followed by strategic exclusions fits this pattern perfectly.\n\n4. **Pressure communications**: The emails expressing intense pressure and stating \"I need this one to work\" provide clear motivation for misconduct. Someone under this pressure might rationalize data manipulation as necessary for their career survival.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, all of these observations are not just likely but are exactly what we would predict:\n- The statistical manipulation would produce the suspicious p-value pattern\n- She would modify documentation to cover her tracks\n- She would exclude unfavorable data points\n- Her communications would reflect the pressure driving her actions\n\nThese pieces of evidence are highly consistent with and predictable consequences of academic misconduct in this context.\n\n92"

Academic misconduct often occurs due to specific circumstances (career pressure, high-stakes situations) rather than being a consistent pattern. Many documented cases of research misconduct involved researchers with previously good reputations.\n\n2. **Lab-wide analysis patterns**: If Lena was manipulating data, the fact that other students also run multiple analysis scripts would actually provide perfect cover for her misconduct. She could hide selective reporting and p-hacking within what appears to be normal lab practice of robustness checking.\n\n3. **Technical issues**: The hardware failure and software switch, while legitimately documented, could be coincidentally timed or potentially exploited to obscure evidence of manipulation. These technical issues could provide convenient explanations for missing files that might have contained evidence of misconduct.\n\n4. **Legitimate participant exclusions**: Even if committing misconduct, Lena would likely still exclude participants for legitimate reasons when they exist. Having some valid exclusions doesn't preclude also having invalid ones. The notes predating submission could reflect standard practice she follows for legitimate exclusions while still manipulating other aspects.\n\nIf Lena committed misconduct, these observations are still reasonably likely because:\n- Misconduct often occurs against a background of otherwise normal practices\n- Lab practices could provide cover for manipulation\n- Technical issues could obscure evidence\n- Some legitimate practices would continue alongside misconduct\n\n45"
