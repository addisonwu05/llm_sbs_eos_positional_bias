    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence under the assumption that Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns are quite common in academic settings - many graduate students feel this pressure and express it privately, regardless of whether they would act unethically. This could reasonably occur even without misconduct.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who weren't in the final dataset could have innocent explanations - normal data cleaning, technical issues, or legitimate exclusions based on pre-existing criteria.\n\nHowever, two pieces of evidence are much harder to explain innocently:\n\n1) Modifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious methodological violation. While there could be rare legitimate reasons (like discovering a fundamental error in the original plan), this is generally considered unacceptable practice and strongly suggests post-hoc adjustments to improve results.\n\n2) The unusual concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above 0.05 across several analyses is statistically very suspicious. Under normal circumstances, p-values should be more randomly distributed around the 0.05 threshold. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence might have an innocent explanation, the combination - especially the p-value distribution pattern and post-hoc preregistration changes - creates a highly improbable scenario if no misconduct occurred.\n\n15"

When people are under significant pressure and feel their career depends on specific results, this creates the psychological conditions that often lead to research fraud.\n\nThe modification of the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a classic form of academic misconduct. This allows researchers to retroactively adjust their hypotheses and methods to match whatever patterns emerged in the data, which is exactly what someone engaging in misconduct would do.\n\nHaving participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded fits perfectly with misconduct - this suggests selective exclusion of participants whose data didn't support the desired results. This is a common form of data manipulation.\n\nThe unusual concentration of p-values just below 0.05 with almost none just above 0.05 across several analyses is a textbook signature of p-hacking, selective reporting, or other forms of result manipulation. This pattern is extremely characteristic of academic misconduct and would be highly expected if someone were manipulating their analyses to achieve significant results.\n\nAll of these pieces of evidence are not just consistent with academic misconduct - they are the exact types of evidence that researchers who study academic integrity look for as indicators of fraudulent behavior. Each piece supports and reinforces the others in a pattern that would be very typical if misconduct occurred.\n\n95"

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nTwo participants in the original dataset reported falling asleep during the task or not understanding the instructions; both were excluded based on notes in the raw data files, and those notes predate any journal submission.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\nThe lab switched from one statistical software package to another halfway through the project, and several files were lost when Lena’s laptop hard drive failed. The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

The participant exclusions now have clear justification with contemporaneous notes. The multiple analysis scripts appear to be standard lab practice. The technical issues explain file inconsistencies.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't fully explain the suspicious p-value distribution pattern or the post-hoc preregistration modifications, though the technical issues could potentially contribute to some irregularities.\n\n75"

Many cases of research misconduct involve people who previously had good records but succumbed to pressure in a particular situation. Career pressure can cause even previously ethical researchers to cross lines.\n\nTwo participants being excluded for falling asleep or not understanding instructions, with notes predating submission, would be quite likely even with misconduct. Someone engaging in data manipulation would still make legitimate exclusions where clearly justified - this provides cover and reduces suspicion. Mixed legitimate and illegitimate practices are common in misconduct cases.\n\nThe lab-wide pattern of running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria actually provides perfect cover for misconduct. If everyone is running multiple analyses, it becomes much easier to hide selective reporting or p-hacking among the legitimate robustness testing. This environment might even enable or encourage questionable practices.\n\nThe confirmed hardware failure and software switch provide excellent cover stories for missing files, inconsistent timestamps, and other technical irregularities that might otherwise raise flags. Someone committing misconduct would benefit greatly from having legitimate technical explanations for file inconsistencies.\n\nThese factors don't prevent misconduct - they actually create an environment where misconduct would be easier to hide and explain away.
