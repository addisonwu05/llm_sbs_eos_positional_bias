    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and career concerns could occur innocently - graduate students often feel and discuss such pressures without engaging in misconduct.\n\nHowever, the other evidence points are much harder to explain without misconduct:\n\n- An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several analyses is statistically very unlikely to occur by chance. This pattern is a classic indicator of p-hacking or data manipulation.\n\n- Modifying a preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a clear violation of research protocols that serves no legitimate purpose if the research was conducted honestly.\n\n- Having excluded participants in an earlier analysis script that don't appear in the final dataset, combined with the modified preregistration, suggests post-hoc decisions to improve results.\n\nWhile each individual piece of evidence might have an innocent explanation, the combination of all these factors occurring together in the same study makes an innocent explanation highly improbable. The p-value distribution alone is extremely suspicious, and when combined with the preregistration modifications and participant exclusions, it creates a pattern strongly indicative of data manipulation.\n\n15"
