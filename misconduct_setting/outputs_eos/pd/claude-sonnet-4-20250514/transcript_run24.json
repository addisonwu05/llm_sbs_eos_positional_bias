    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence individually:\n\nThe emails expressing pressure and need for results could occur in many academic contexts without misconduct, as career pressures are common and researchers often discuss stakes openly.\n\nHowever, the combination of the other three pieces of evidence creates a highly suspicious pattern:\n\n1. Modifying preregistration after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of research integrity principles, even if done unconsciously.\n\n2. The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across multiple analyses is statistically very unlikely to occur naturally and suggests p-hacking or selective reporting.\n\n3. An earlier analysis script containing additional participants who were later excluded, combined with the modified preregistration changing exclusion criteria, suggests systematic removal of data that didn't support the hypothesis.\n\nWhile each individual element might have innocent explanations, their co-occurrence - particularly the statistical pattern of p-values combined with post-hoc changes to preregistration and participant exclusions - creates a constellation of evidence that would be extremely unlikely to arise through honest mistakes or coincidence alone.\n\nThe probability that all these elements would occur together without intentional manipulation is very low.\n\n15"

This type of exclusion with proper documentation would be expected in legitimate research.\n\nA lab switching statistical software mid-project and experiencing hardware failures are common occurrences in academic settings. The IT department confirmation of the hardware failure provides independent verification of a mundane technical issue.\n\nRunning multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness exploration, with similar patterns shown by other students, indicates this was standard practice and methodology in the lab rather than individual misconduct.\n\nA clean prior record with well-documented, reproducible data that passed independent audit strongly supports a pattern of research integrity and proper methodology.\n\nThese elements all align with normal research practices and create a coherent picture of someone following established lab protocols and maintaining proper research standards. The technical issues (software switch, hardware failure) are independently verifiable mundane explanations for file inconsistencies.\n\n85"

However, the fact that other students show similar patterns suggests this was standard lab practice rather than individual misconduct behavior.\n\nThe two participants excluded for legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with pre-dating notes would be expected regardless of misconduct, as these represent appropriate exclusions that even someone manipulating data would make.\n\nThe software switch and confirmed hardware failure are independent, verifiable events that would occur regardless of any individual's intentions regarding data manipulation.\n\nThe strong prior record of clean, well-documented data that passed independent audit creates a significant inconsistency with misconduct behavior.
