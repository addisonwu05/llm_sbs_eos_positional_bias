    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at each piece of evidence if Lena did not commit misconduct:\n\n1. **P-hacking pattern**: An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above .05 across several exploratory analyses is a classic statistical red flag. While this could theoretically occur by chance, it's highly improbable across multiple analyses without deliberate manipulation.\n\n2. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: Modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious breach of scientific protocol. Even if done innocently, this fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration and is extremely difficult to justify as an honest mistake.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions**: Having participants in earlier analysis scripts who were later excluded could have legitimate explanations (data quality issues, protocol violations, etc.), but combined with the other evidence, this becomes more suspicious.\n\n4. **Pressure emails**: While expressing career pressure is normal and doesn't constitute misconduct by itself, the specific phrasing \"I need this one to work\" in context suggests a mindset that could lead to questionable research practices.\n\nThe combination of these factors - particularly the p-hacking pattern and post-hoc preregistration changes - would be extremely unlikely to occur together innocently. The statistical manipulation pattern alone has a very low probability of occurring naturally, and when combined with the procedural irregularities, the likelihood of all these occurring without intentional misconduct becomes vanishingly small.\n\n15"

This pattern of p-values clustering just below .05 with few above .05 is exactly what we would expect from someone selectively reporting analyses or manipulating data to achieve significance.\n\n2. **Post-hoc preregistration changes**: If committing misconduct, changing preregistration documents after data collection would be a logical step to make questionable research practices appear legitimate. This allows retroactively justifying exclusions or analysis choices that were actually made to improve results.\n\n3. **Participant exclusions**: If engaging in misconduct, selectively excluding participants whose data don't support the hypothesis would be a common strategy. Having earlier versions with more participants who were later excluded fits this pattern perfectly.\n\n4. **Pressure emails**: These emails establish clear motive for misconduct - career pressure and supervisor expectations. Someone committing research fraud would very likely be experiencing and expressing exactly these sentiments about needing the study to succeed.\n\nIf Lena was indeed committing academic misconduct, all of these pieces of evidence would be highly expected consequences of that behavior. The p-hacking pattern and preregistration modifications are classic hallmarks of research fraud. The participant exclusions provide a mechanism for the manipulation. The emails establish motive and mindset.\n\nThis constellation of evidence is almost exactly what investigators would expect to find in a clear case of research misconduct.\n\n92"

This would be very common in cognitive studies.\n\n2. **Multiple analysis scripts**: Running alternative analyses with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness exploration is good scientific practice, especially when other students show similar patterns. This demonstrates systematic methodology rather than fishing for results.\n\n3. **Technical issues**: Software transitions and hardware failures are routine occurrences in research labs. The IT-confirmed hard drive failure provides legitimate explanation for missing files, and software switches often happen due to licensing, feature needs, or lab policy changes.\n\n4. **Clean prior record**: A history of well-documented, reproducible data that passed independent audit strongly supports a pattern of ethical research conduct. This prior record weighs heavily in favor of honest research practices.\n\nThese pieces of evidence are all highly consistent with normal, ethical research practices. Participant exclusions for attention/comprehension issues are standard. Running robustness checks is encouraged. Technical problems are commonplace. A clean audit history indicates established good practices.\n\nIf Lena was conducting honest research, we would expect exactly these types of documentation, standard exclusions, methodological thoroughness, and occasional technical setbacks.\n\n85"

However, research misconduct often emerges under specific pressure situations even among previously ethical researchers. Career pressure, supervisor expectations, and high-stakes situations can lead to first-time ethical lapses.\n\nWhile some of this evidence (particularly the clean audit history) works against the misconduct hypothesis, none of it is fundamentally incompatible with someone who decided to engage in questionable practices under extreme pressure.
