    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

While p-hacking or selective reporting could explain some clustering, the described pattern (almost NO p-values just above 0.05) suggests active manipulation rather than natural variation.\n\nThe preregistration being modified after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes is a serious red flag. While honest researchers might make minor clarifications, changing exclusion criteria post-hoc specifically suggests tailoring the analysis to achieve desired results.\n\nAn earlier analysis script showing additional participants later excluded could have innocent explanations (quality control, legitimate exclusions), but combined with the modified preregistration, it suggests post-hoc data manipulation.\n\nThe pressure emails, while showing concerning motivation and pressure, could reflect normal academic stress without implying misconduct.\n\nThe combination of these factors - particularly the statistical pattern that defies natural probability distributions and the post-hoc preregistration changes - makes an innocent explanation highly unlikely. The probability that all these suspicious elements would occur together without intentional manipulation is very low.\n\n15"

Someone committing misconduct might exploit this normal practice.\n\nThe two participants excluded for legitimate reasons (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with pre-submission notes would be quite likely even if misconduct occurred - these represent genuine quality control that would happen regardless, and could provide cover for other questionable exclusions.\n\nThe software switch and confirmed hard drive failure would be moderately likely to occur by coincidence even during misconduct - these are external events independent of research integrity. However, someone committing misconduct might exploit these circumstances to obscure evidence.\n\nA prior clean record with well-documented data that passed independent audit would be less expected if someone were inclined toward misconduct, but not impossible. Academic misconduct often emerges under specific pressures even among previously ethical researchers, and the emails showed unusual career pressure.\n\nWhile some of these factors could coincidentally occur or be exploited during misconduct, the combination of legitimate procedural explanations, external technical issues, and especially the strong prior ethical track record makes this particular pattern somewhat less likely in a misconduct scenario.\n\n35"
