    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "Looking at this scenario, I need to assess the likelihood of all these pieces of evidence occurring together if Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct.\n\nLet me consider each piece of evidence:\n\n1. **Email statements about pressure**: While concerning, expressing career pressure and hoping for positive results is unfortunately common in academia. Graduate students often feel this way legitimately. This alone wouldn't be that unusual.\n\n2. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: This is a serious red flag. Legitimate researchers sometimes need to make protocol changes, but doing so after seeing the data and not transparently reporting it as a deviation is highly problematic and goes against research integrity principles.\n\n3. **Excluded participants from earlier analysis script**: Some participant exclusions can be legitimate (protocol violations, technical issues, etc.), but combined with the other evidence, this becomes more suspicious.\n\n4. **P-hacking pattern (many p-values just below .05, almost none just above)**: This is perhaps the strongest statistical red flag. In legitimate research, p-values should be roughly uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. Having many values clustered just below .05 with very few just above is a classic signature of data manipulation or selective reporting.\n\nThe combination of ALL these factors occurring together by chance, while Lena remained completely honest, would require:\n- Legitimate reasons for all participant exclusions\n- Innocent reasons for post-hoc preregistration changes\n- An extremely unlikely statistical coincidence in p-value distribution\n- All of this happening under intense pressure where she explicitly stated she \"needs this one to work\"\n\nWhile each individual piece might have an innocent explanation, the convergence of all these red flags simultaneously makes the innocent explanation highly improbable.\n\n15"

Someone fabricating data would almost certainly be feeling and expressing this kind of career pressure.\n\n2. **Modified preregistration after data collection**: This would be extremely likely as a deliberate strategy. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data is a classic form of misconduct called \"HARKing\" (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) and post-hoc protocol manipulation.\n\n3. **Excluded participants from earlier analysis**: This would be very likely if someone was manipulating data. Selectively removing participants whose data don't support the desired hypothesis is a common form of data falsification.\n\n4. **P-hacking pattern**: This would be extremely likely. The concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none above is a nearly perfect signature of deliberate data manipulation - either through selective analysis, data fabrication, or \"fishing\" until getting desired results.\n\nAll of these behaviors are textbook examples of research misconduct patterns. They represent the exact types of evidence one would expect to find if someone was systematically manipulating their research. The emails show motive, the modified preregistration shows post-hoc rationalization, the excluded participants show selective data use, and the p-value distribution shows statistical manipulation.\n\nThese pieces of evidence form a coherent pattern that would be highly expected if misconduct occurred.\n\n92"

The IT department confirms that a hardware failure was reported and repaired around that time.\n\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness. Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

    "content": "Looking at this new evidence assuming Lena did NOT commit academic misconduct:\n\n1. **Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria**: If this was part of a lab-wide robustness exploration and other students show similar patterns, this would be quite likely in legitimate research. Robustness checks are a standard practice.\n\n2. **Two participants excluded for falling asleep/not understanding instructions**: This would be very likely in honest research. These are completely legitimate exclusion reasons, and having contemporaneous notes that predate submission is exactly what you'd expect from proper documentation.\n\n3. **Software switch and hard drive failure**: These technical issues would be moderately likely to occur during any research project. The IT department confirmation of the hardware failure adds credibility to this explanation for missing files.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented research**: This would be very likely if Lena is an honest researcher. People who fabricate data rarely do so for the first time on a high-stakes project - there are usually prior warning signs. A clean audit history strongly supports honest research practices.\n\nThese pieces of evidence are all quite consistent with normal, legitimate research practices. Labs do explore robustness, participants do need to be excluded for valid reasons, technical problems do occur, and honest researchers typically have consistent patterns of good practices across studies.\n\nUnlike the previous suspicious evidence, these factors represent exactly what you would expect to see in honest research conducted under normal academic conditions.\n\n78"

She might be more selective or secretive about her manipulations.\n\n2. **Two participants excluded for legitimate reasons with predating notes**: Even if committing misconduct, Lena would likely still exclude obviously problematic participants for valid reasons. Someone fabricating data doesn't necessarily fabricate everything - they often mix legitimate practices with manipulated elements to avoid detection.\n\n3. **Software switch and confirmed hard drive failure**: These technical issues would still occur regardless of whether someone is committing misconduct. Hardware failures and software transitions happen independently of researcher behavior. However, someone committing misconduct might be relieved that missing files make their manipulation harder to detect.\n\n4. **Prior record of clean, well-documented research that passed audit**: This is the most challenging factor. While not impossible, it's less common for someone with a strong track record of research integrity to suddenly engage in serious misconduct. However, intense career pressure can sometimes cause even previously honest researchers to compromise their standards.\n\nThe technical issues and some legitimate exclusions would still occur, but the clean prior record and normal lab practices make this combination somewhat less likely if misconduct was occurring.\n\n35"
