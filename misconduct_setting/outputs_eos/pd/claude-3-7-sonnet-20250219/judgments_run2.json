  "Based on the evidence presented, I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer. The unusual concentration of p-values just below .05, modified preregistration, excluded participants, and concerning emails suggest potential misconduct. However, there are also mitigating factors like documented legitimate exclusions, confirmed technical issues, lab-wide exploration of different analyses, and her previously clean record.\n\nThe evidence presents a mixed picture with concerning patterns but also plausible explanations for some irregularities. Without additional investigation, such as statistical analysis of the raw data or interviews with other lab members, I cannot make a conclusive determination.\n\nThis case represents a gray area where further investigation would be needed before making a definitive judgment about misconduct."
