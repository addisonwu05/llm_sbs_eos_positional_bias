    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "I need to assess the likelihood that all these suspicious patterns would occur innocently if Lena did not commit misconduct.\n\nThe concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically improbable without some form of p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern is widely recognized in research integrity literature as a red flag.\n\nModifying preregistration documents after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes directly contradicts research integrity principles. Preregistration exists specifically to prevent researchers from adjusting analyses after seeing results.\n\nThe excluded participants from an earlier script suggests potential selective reporting.\n\nThe emails demonstrate clear motivation and pressure to produce significant results, though expressing career concerns doesn't automatically prove misconduct.\n\nIf Lena did not commit misconduct, all of these issues would need innocent explanations simultaneously:\n- The p-value distribution would need to occur by chance (extremely unlikely)\n- The preregistration modification would be an administrative error\n- The participant exclusion would be scientifically justified\n- The emails would merely express normal career anxiety\n\nThe combination of statistical anomalies, documented procedural violations, and expressed motivation makes innocent explanations for all these issues occurring together highly implausible.\n\n5"

This pattern would be a natural consequence of trying different analyses until finding significant results.\n\nModifying the preregistration document after data collection to change exclusion criteria and primary outcomes aligns with misconduct aimed at producing desired outcomes. This represents an attempt to make the analysis plan match already-known favorable results.\n\nThe existence of an earlier analysis script with participants who were later excluded is consistent with selectively removing data points to achieve significance.\n\nThe emails expressing pressure about the study needing to \"work\" provide clear motivation for misconduct. While not evidence of misconduct itself, these statements establish context that makes deliberate manipulation more plausible.\n\nIf misconduct occurred, these patterns aren't just possible - they're exactly the kind of evidence we would expect to see. These indicators frequently co-occur in confirmed cases of research fraud.\n\n95"

This is consistent with thorough research practices, especially since other students show similar patterns.\n\nA software switch mid-project and hardware failure are common technical challenges in research. The IT department's confirmation of the reported hard drive failure provides independent verification of this explanation.\n\nThe exclusion of two participants based on documented issues (falling asleep, not understanding instructions) with notes predating journal submission is consistent with legitimate data cleaning practices. These exclusions appear properly documented rather than post-hoc manipulation.\n\nLena's prior clean record with well-documented data that passed an independent audit establishes a pattern of research integrity. This is meaningful context about her typical approach to data management.\n\nThese contextual factors represent normal research challenges and appropriate scientific practices that would be expected in many legitimate research projects.\n\n95"
