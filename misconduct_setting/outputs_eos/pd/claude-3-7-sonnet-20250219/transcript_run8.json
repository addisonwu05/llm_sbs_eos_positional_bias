    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

An unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with very few just above is a statistical anomaly that strongly suggests p-hacking or data manipulation. This pattern is extremely unlikely to occur naturally and is a well-known indicator of questionable research practices.\n\nWhen combining all these elements - especially the modified preregistration with changed outcomes and the suspicious p-value distribution - the probability that all these observations would occur without academic misconduct is very low.\n\n5"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, these observations align strongly with typical patterns of data manipulation. The clustering of p-values just below .05 with few just above is a classic signature of p-hacking or selective reporting. Modifying the preregistration after data collection to change criteria and outcomes is exactly what someone might do to ensure significant results. Excluding participants found in earlier analyses is consistent with removing data points that don't support desired outcomes. The emails provide clear motive for misconduct - career pressure and grant considerations. All these elements are highly consistent with intentional manipulation rather than coincidence or honest error. While no probability can be 100% without direct confession or proof of fabrication, the consistency of these indicators with known patterns of academic misconduct is extremely high.\n\n95"

Other students in the lab show similar patterns in their scripts.\n\n\n If Lena did not commit academic misconduct, how likely is it that the lab’s data management logs would show that she ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria, similar to other students, two participants would be excluded because they reported falling asleep or not understanding the instructions, with notes that predate the journal submission, the lab would have switched software mid-project and her laptop would suffer a confirmed hard drive failure leading to some file loss, and she would have a prior record of clean, well-documented data in earlier studies that passed an independent audit?\nPlease ***ONLY*** output a probability judgment which is an integer between 0 and 100, where 100 denotes certainty.

Having multiple analysis scripts with varying criteria is consistent with both legitimate robustness testing and selective reporting. The legitimate exclusion of two participants with documented issues doesn't preclude other improper manipulations. Software transitions and hard drive failures occur regardless of misconduct and could potentially provide convenient cover. Previous clean research records are common among researchers who later commit misconduct - many start with proper practices before facing pressure that leads to misconduct. The probability that all these elements would exist even if misconduct occurred is moderately high, as they represent a mix of normal lab conditions, legitimate practices, and circumstances that could either be coincidental or potentially exploited to obscure misconduct.\n\n65"
