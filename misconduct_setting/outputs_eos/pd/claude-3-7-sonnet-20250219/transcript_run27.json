    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

This directly contradicts the purpose of preregistration.\n\nThe earlier analysis script containing excluded participants, combined with the modified preregistration changing exclusion criteria, suggests potential selective reporting to achieve desired results.\n\nLena's emails reveal strong motivation to produce positive results, with explicit statements about needing the study \"to work\" and concerns about career implications of null results.\n\nWhile honest mistakes can occur in research, this combination of factors - especially the unusual p-value distribution and post-data collection changes to preregistration - would be extremely unlikely without some form of intentional data manipulation.\n\n5"

The IT department's confirmation of the hardware issue adds credibility to this explanation.\n\nLena's clean prior record with well-documented data that passed an independent audit suggests she has historically maintained good research practices. This established pattern of behavior supports the possibility that current irregularities are not intentional misconduct.\n\nThe exclusion of two participants based on contemporaneous notes (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) that predate journal submission demonstrates appropriate participant exclusion with proper documentation.\n\nThese factors together present a coherent alternative explanation for the concerning patterns initially observed.\n\n85"
