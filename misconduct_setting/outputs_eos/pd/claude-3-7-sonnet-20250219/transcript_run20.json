    "content": "Lena is a third-year PhD student in a cognitive neuroscience lab. She is working on a high-profile experiment testing a new theory about memory. The study involves 80 participants, and her supervisor, Professor Mills, is under pressure to produce publishable findings before a major grant review.\nLena runs the study and processes the data herself. The first draft of the paper reports strong, statistically significant support for the theory: the main effect is in the predicted direction with p = .01, and several secondary analyses also yield “clean” results. The paper is submitted to a top journal and receives enthusiastic initial reviews.\nHowever, concerns are raised after an anonymous whistleblower emails the department, claiming that some of Lena’s data “look too perfect” and that key analyses were changed after reviewers’ comments. An internal inquiry is opened into possible research misconduct, including fabrication or falsification of data.\nDuring the inquiry, multiple pieces of information emerge. Some patterns in the dataset and analysis history seem suspicious, but there are also mundane explanations: the lab recently switched software; some files are missing due to a hard drive failure; and Lena has a previously strong record of careful data handling. Lena insists that any irregularities are due to honest mistakes or miscommunication, not intentional fraud.\nLena is effectively being evaluated for whether she intentionally manipulated or fabricated data in this study, as opposed to the results being genuine/any errors being unintentional."

    "content": "To assess the likelihood that these observations would occur if Lena did not commit misconduct, I need to evaluate each piece of evidence:\n\n1. The unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none just above is statistically highly improbable in genuine research. This pattern is a classic sign of p-hacking or data manipulation, as it indicates selective reporting or analysis adjustments to push results below the significance threshold.\n\n2. The modified preregistration document after data collection is a serious violation of research protocol. Changing exclusion criteria and primary outcomes after seeing the data fundamentally undermines the purpose of preregistration, which is to prevent selective analysis.\n\n3. Excluded participants from an earlier analysis is concerning, though could potentially have legitimate reasons if there were valid exclusion criteria applied consistently.\n\n4. The emails show clear motivation for obtaining significant results, creating pressure that could lead to questionable research practices.\n\nWhile each individual element might have an innocent explanation with some probability, the combination of all these factors occurring simultaneously without misconduct is extremely unlikely. The p-value distribution in particular is a statistical anomaly that's difficult to explain without selective reporting or manipulation.\n\nIf Lena truly committed no misconduct, the probability of all these suspicious elements appearing together by chance or through innocent mistakes is very low.\n\n2"

    "content": "If Lena did commit academic misconduct, these patterns of evidence are highly consistent with what we would expect to see. The concentration of p-values just below .05 is a classic statistical signature of p-hacking or data manipulation, as researchers who manipulate analyses often stop when they reach statistical significance. Modifying preregistration documents after data collection to change criteria is a direct form of misconduct designed to make results appear more convincing. Excluding participants from the final dataset after including them in earlier analyses suggests potential data selection to achieve desired outcomes. The emails provide clear motive for misconduct, showing Lena felt significant pressure for positive results. Together, these elements form a coherent picture of academic misconduct - the statistical anomalies are the fingerprints, the altered documentation shows the mechanism, and the emails establish motive. If misconduct occurred, we would expect precisely these types of evidence to emerge.\n\n95"

Her earlier projects in the same lab passed an independent data audit conducted the year before, and her raw data and scripts for those projects were rated as “well-documented and reproducible.”\n\nThe lab’s data management logs show that Lena ran and stored multiple alternative analysis scripts, some with stricter and some with looser exclusion criteria, as part of a lab-wide push to explore robustness.

    "content": "If Lena did not commit misconduct, these additional circumstances would be fairly likely to occur. Having a clean prior record with well-documented data that passed an audit is consistent with someone who maintains research integrity. Running multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria as part of a lab-wide robustness initiative is a legitimate practice when properly documented and not selectively reported. The exclusion of two participants based on clear criteria (falling asleep/not understanding instructions) with contemporaneous documentation predating submission is standard practice. Software transitions and hardware failures are common challenges in research environments that can explain some irregularities in file management. These circumstances represent typical experiences in research labs and would create a normal background against which an honest researcher could operate. There's nothing particularly unusual about this combination of events for someone conducting research without misconduct.\n\n85"

A previously clean record doesn't prevent someone from engaging in misconduct later when under pressure. Multiple analysis scripts with different exclusion criteria would actually facilitate p-hacking by allowing selection of the most favorable results. The legitimate exclusion of two participants doesn't preclude improper handling of other data. Software transitions and hard drive failures, while real events, could conveniently explain missing files that might otherwise reveal problematic analyses. These circumstances don't contradict misconduct - they could either be independent events that occurred alongside misconduct, or in some cases, might have provided opportunity or cover for questionable practices. A researcher engaging in misconduct could operate within a generally legitimate lab environment while selectively manipulating certain aspects of their work.\n\n75"
