  "Looking at all the evidence, I believe Lena likely committed academic misconduct.\n\nThe strongest evidence against her includes:\n- Modified preregistration after data collection\n- Unusually high concentration of p-values just below .05 with almost none above (a statistical pattern highly unlikely to occur naturally)\n- Emails expressing pressure and \"needing this to work\"\n\nWhile there are mitigating factors:\n- Documented legitimate exclusions of two participants\n- Software switch and hard drive failure explaining some inconsistencies\n- Clean prior record and lab-wide practices of running multiple analyses\n\nThe statistical anomalies in p-values and the modified preregistration are particularly concerning patterns that are difficult to explain through innocent means. These issues, combined with the expressed career pressure, suggest deliberate manipulation rather than coincidence or innocent error.\n\nYes"
